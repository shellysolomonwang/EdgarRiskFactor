Item 1A. Risk Factors,” “Part II – Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and “Part II – Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data”; and our current reports on Form 8-K filed in 2010.   In this report, in addition to providing consolidated revenues and net income (loss), we also provide segment operating revenues and income (loss) from operations because we believe they are meaningful measures of revenues and the profitability of our operating segments. Income (loss) from operations is net income recorded in accordance with United States of America generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) excluding the after-tax effects of the following items, as applicable:       ·   Realized gains and losses associated with the following (“excluded realized loss”):            §   Sales or disposals of securities;            §   Impairments of securities;            §   Change in the fair value of embedded derivatives within certain reinsurance arrangements and the change in the fair value of our trading securities;            §   Change in the fair value of the derivatives we own to hedge our guaranteed death benefit (“GDB”) riders within our variable annuities, which is referred to as “GDB derivatives results”;            §   Change in the fair value of the embedded derivatives of our guaranteed living benefit (“GLB”) riders within our variable annuities accounted for under the Derivatives and Hedging and the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topics of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards CodificationTM (“ASC”) (“embedded derivative reserves”), net of the change in the fair value of the derivatives we own to hedge the changes in the embedded derivative reserves, the net of which is referred to as “GLB net derivative results”; and            §   Changes in the fair value of the embedded derivative liabilities related to index call options we may purchase in the future to hedge contract holder index allocations applicable to future reset periods for our indexed annuity products accounted for under the Derivatives and Hedging and the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topics of the FASB ASC (“indexed annuity forward-starting option”).        ·   Change in reserves accounted for under the Financial Services – Insurance – Claim Costs and Liabilities for Future Policy Benefits Subtopic of the FASB ASC resulting from benefit ratio unlocking on our GDB and GLB riders (“benefit ratio unlocking”);        ·   Income (loss) from the initial adoption of new accounting standards;        ·   Income (loss) from reserve changes (net of related amortization) on business sold through reinsurance;        ·   Gain (loss) on early extinguishment of debt;        ·   Losses from the impairment of intangible assets; and        ·   Income (loss) from discontinued operations.      Income (loss) from operations available to common stockholders is net income (loss) available to common stockholders (used in the calculation of earnings (loss) per share) in accordance with GAAP, excluding the after-tax effects of the items above and any acceleration of our Series B preferred stock discount as a result of repayment prior to five years from the date of issuance.   Operating revenues represent GAAP revenues excluding the pre-tax effects of the following items, as applicable:       ·   Excluded realized loss;        ·   Amortization of deferred front-end loads (“DFEL”) arising from changes in GDB and GLB benefit ratio unlocking;        ·   Amortization of deferred gains arising from the reserve changes on business sold through reinsurance; and        ·   Revenue adjustments from the initial adoption of new accounting standards.             53           Operating revenues and income (loss) from operations are the financial performance measures we use to evaluate and assess the results of our segments. Accordingly, we report operating revenues and income (loss) from operations by segment in Note 14. Our management and Board of Directors believe that operating revenues and income (loss) from operations explain the results of our ongoing businesses in a manner that allows for a better understanding of the underlying trends in our current businesses because the excluded items are unpredictable and not necessarily indicative of current operating fundamentals or future performance of the business segments, and, in many instances, decisions regarding these items do not necessarily relate to the operations of the individual segments. In addition, we believe that our definitions of operating revenues and income (loss) from operations will provide investors with a more valuable measure of our performance because it better reveals trends in our business.   We use our prevailing corporate federal income tax rate of 35% while taking into account any permanent differences for events recognized differently in our financial statements and federal income tax returns when reconciling our non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measure. Operating revenues and income (loss) from operations do not replace revenues and net income as the GAAP measures of our consolidated results of operations.   Certain reclassifications have been made to prior periods’ financial information.   FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS – CAUTIONARY LANGUAGE   Certain statements made in this report and in other written or oral statements made by us or on our behalf are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (“PSLRA”).

Risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to vary materially, some of which are described within the forward-looking statements, include, among others:       ·   Deterioration in general economic and business conditions, both domestic and foreign, that may affect foreign exchange rates, premium levels, claims experience, the level of pension benefit costs and funding and investment results;        ·   Economic declines and credit market illiquidity could cause us to realize additional impairments on investments and certain intangible assets, including goodwill and a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets, which may reduce future earnings and/or affect our financial condition and ability to raise additional capital or refinance existing debt as it matures;        ·   Uncertainty about the impact of existing or new stimulus legislation on the economy;        ·   The cost and other consequences of our participation in the U.S. Treasury’s Troubled Asset Relief Program (“TARP”) Capital Purchase Program (“CPP”), including the impact of existing regulation and future regulations to which we may become subject;        ·   Legislative, regulatory or tax changes, both domestic and foreign, that affect the cost of, or demand for, our subsidiaries’ products, the required amount of reserves and/or surplus, or otherwise affect our ability to conduct business, including changes to statutory reserves and/or risk-based capital (“RBC”) requirements related to secondary guarantees under universal life and variable annuity products such as Actuarial Guideline (“AG”) 43 (“AG43,” also known as Commissioners Annuity Reserve Valuation Method for Variable Annuities or “VACARVM”); restrictions on revenue sharing and 12b-1 payments; and the potential for U.S. Federal tax reform;        ·   The initiation of legal or regulatory proceedings against us, and the outcome of any legal or regulatory proceedings, such as: adverse actions related to present or past business practices common in businesses in which we compete; adverse decisions in significant actions including, but not limited to, actions brought by federal and state authorities and extra-contractual and class action damage cases; new decisions that result in changes in law; and unexpected trial court rulings;        ·   Changes in interest rates causing a reduction of investment income, the margins of our subsidiaries’ fixed annuity and life insurance businesses and demand for their products;        ·   A decline in the equity markets causing a reduction in the sales of our subsidiaries’ products, a reduction of asset-based fees that our subsidiaries charge on various investment and insurance products, an acceleration of amortization of deferred acquisition costs (“DAC”), value of business acquired (“VOBA”), deferred sales inducements (“DSI”) and DFEL and an increase in liabilities related to guaranteed benefit features of our subsidiaries’ variable annuity products;         ·   Ineffectiveness of our various hedging strategies used to offset the impact of changes in the value of liabilities due to changes in the level and volatility of the equity markets and interest rates;          54               ·   A deviation in actual experience regarding future persistency, mortality, morbidity, interest rates or equity market returns from the assumptions used in pricing our subsidiaries’ products, in establishing related insurance reserves and in the amortization of intangibles that may cause an increase in reserves and/or a reduction in assets, resulting in a corresponding decrease in net income;        ·   Changes in GAAP that may result in unanticipated changes to our net income;        ·   Lowering of one or more of LNC’s debt ratings issued by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations and the adverse impact such action may have on LNC’s ability to raise capital and on its liquidity and financial condition;        ·   Lowering of one or more of the insurer financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries and the adverse impact such action may have on the premium writings, policy retention, profitability of our insurance subsidiaries and liquidity;        ·   Significant credit, accounting, fraud or corporate governance issues that may adversely affect the value of certain investments in our portfolios requiring that we realize losses on such investments;        ·   The impact of acquisitions and divestitures, restructurings, product withdrawals and other unusual items, including our ability to integrate acquisitions and to obtain the anticipated results and synergies from acquisitions;        ·   The adequacy and collectibility of reinsurance that we have purchased;        ·   Acts of terrorism, a pandemic, war or other man-made and natural catastrophes that may adversely affect our businesses and the cost and availability of reinsurance;        ·   Competitive conditions, including pricing pressures, new product offerings and the emergence of new competitors, that may affect the level of premiums and fees that our subsidiaries can charge for their products;        ·   The unknown impact on our subsidiaries’ businesses resulting from changes in the demographics of their client base, as aging baby-boomers move from the asset-accumulation stage to the asset-distribution stage of life; and        ·   Loss of key management, financial planners or wholesalers.      The risks included here are not exhaustive. Our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and other documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) include additional factors that could impact our businesses and financial performance. Moreover, we operate in a rapidly changing and competitive environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors.   Further, it is not possible to assess the impact of all risk factors on our businesses or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results. In addition, we disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that occur after the date of this report.   INTRODUCTION   Executive Summary   We are a holding company that operates multiple insurance and retirement businesses through subsidiary companies. Through our business segments, we sell a wide range of wealth protection, accumulation and retirement income products and solutions. These products include fixed and indexed annuities, variable annuities, universal life insurance (“UL”), variable universal life insurance (“VUL”), linked-benefit UL, term life insurance, mutual funds and group protection.   We provide products and services in two operating businesses and report results through four business segments as follows:         Business   Corresponding Segments    Retirement Solutions   Annuities      Defined Contribution         Insurance Solutions   Life Insurance      Group Protection        These operating businesses and their segments are described in “Part I – Item 1. Business” of our 2009 Form 10-K.          55           We also have Other Operations, which includes the financial data for operations that are not directly related to the business segments. Other Operations also includes investments related to the excess capital in our insurance subsidiaries; investments in media properties and other corporate investments; benefit plan net assets; the unamortized deferred gain on indemnity reinsurance related to the sale of reinsurance to Swiss Re in 2001; the results of certain disability income business due to the rescission of a reinsurance agreement with Swiss Re; our run-off Institutional Pension business; and debt costs.   Our former Lincoln UK and Investment Management segments are reported in discontinued operations for all periods presented. See “Acquisitions and Dispositions” in our 2009 Form 10-K and Note 3 for more information.   For information on how we derive our revenues, see the discussion in results of operations by segment below.   Current Market Conditions   Subsequent to the first quarter of 2009, the capital and credit markets improved following a period of extreme volatility and disruption that affected both equity market returns and interest rates. During this period, credit spreads widened across asset classes and reduced liquidity in the credit markets. The price of our common stock increased during 2009 and into 2010 to close at $30.70 on March 31, 2010, as compared to $24.88 on December 31, 2009, after having traded at a low of $4.90 during the first quarter of 2009. We also experienced a series of ratings downgrades primarily from February 2009 to May 2009 as depressed capital markets continued to strain our liquidity as we prepared to fund debt maturities in the second quarter of 2009; however, during June of 2009 and following the announcement of our planned capital actions, all four of the major independent rating agencies affirmed our financial strength ratings, and Standard & Poor’s (“S&P”) improved its outlook on our company to stable from negative. For more information about ratings, see “Part I – Item 1. Business – Ratings” in our 2009 Form 10-K.   Although market conditions have improved, the National Bureau of Economic Research (“NBER”), a panel of economists charged with officially designating business cycles, announced in April 2010 that it cannot yet declare an end to the recession that began in December 2007, as the timing of an upward turn in the economy has been harder to discern than in the past. An NBER committee stated that a determination of the “trough” date based on current data would be premature. The prior significant decline in the equity markets continues to constrain growth of average account values. In the face of these capital market challenges, we continue to focus on building our businesses through these difficult markets and beyond by developing and introducing high quality products, expanding distribution in new and existing key accounts and channels and targeting market segments that have high growth potential while maintaining a disciplined approach to managing our expenses. During the first quarter of 2010, we experienced higher deposits and net flows than in the comparable period of 2009.   The markets have primarily impacted the following areas:   Earnings from Account Values   Our asset-gathering segments – Retirement Solutions – Annuities and Retirement Solutions – Defined Contribution – are the most sensitive to the equity markets, as well as, to a lesser extent, our Insurance Solutions – Life Insurance segment. We discuss the earnings impact of the equity markets on account values and the related asset-based earnings below in “Part I – Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – Equity Market Risk – Impact of Equity Market Sensitivity.” From December 31, 2009, to March 31, 2010, our account values were up $4.3 billion driven by strong deposits, positive net flows and continuing improvements in the equity markets. During this time, the daily average value of the S&P 500 Index® (“S&P 500”) increased 3%, and it increased approximately 38% from the first quarter of 2009.    Investment Income on Alternative Investments   We believe that overall market conditions in both the equity and credit markets caused our alternative investments portfolio, which consists primarily of hedge funds and various limited partnership investments, to perform consistently with our long-term return expectations. These investments impact primarily our Insurance Solutions – Life Insurance segment and to a lesser extent our other segments. See “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Investments – Valuation of Alternative Investments” in our 2009 Form 10-K and “Consolidated Investments – Alternative Investments” below for additional information on our investment portfolio.          56           Variable Annuity Hedge Program Results   We offer variable annuity products with living benefit guarantees. As described in “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Derivatives – Guaranteed Living Benefits” in our 2009 Form 10-K, we use derivative instruments to hedge our exposure to the risks and earnings volatility that result from the GLB embedded derivatives in certain of our variable annuity products. The change in fair value of these instruments tends to move in the opposite direction of the change in embedded derivative reserves. These results are excluded from the Retirement Solutions – Annuities and Defined Contribution segments’ operating revenues and income from operations. See “Realized Loss – Operating Realized Gain – GLB” for information on our methodology for calculating the non-performance risk (“NPR”), which affects the discount rate used in the calculation of the GLB embedded derivative reserve.   We also offer variable products with death benefit guarantees. As described in “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Future Contract Benefits and Other Contract Holder Obligations – Guaranteed Death Benefits” in our 2009 Form 10-K, we use derivative instruments to attempt to hedge the income statement impact in the opposite direction of the GDB benefit ratio unlocking for movements in equity markets. These results are excluded from income (loss) from operations.   Credit Losses, Impairments and Unrealized Losses   Related to our investments in fixed income and equity securities, we experienced net realized losses that reduced net income by $27 million for the first quarter of 2010, and included credit-related write-downs of securities for other-than-temporary impairments (“OTTI”) of $34 million. Although economic conditions have improved, we expect a continuation of some level of OTTI. If we were to experience another period of weakness in the economic environment like we did in late 2008 and early 2009, it could lead to increased credit defaults, resulting in additional write-downs of securities for OTTI.   Increased liquidity in several market segments and improved credit fundamentals (i.e., market improvement and narrowing credit spreads) as of March 31, 2010, compared to December 31, 2009, have resulted in the $802 million decrease in gross unrealized losses on the available-for-sale (“AFS”) fixed maturity securities in our general account as of March 31, 2010.   TARP CPP    We issued $950 million of preferred stock and a common stock warrant through the U.S. Treasury’s TARP CPP in the third quarter of 2009 as a means to strengthen our capital position during the financial crisis that began in the fourth quarter of 2008. As a result of the improvements in the economy and capital markets since the beginning of the year as well as the strength of our business model and our capital position, we are likely to accelerate our timeframe for repayment of the U.S. Treasury’s CPP investment prior to the second half of 2010. Our ability to make this repayment may be subject to conditions from the U.S. Government, such as a requirement that we must raise additional equity capital. Our ability to raise such capital will in turn depend on a variety of considerations, including, but not limited to, the terms on which we could raise it and any potential effect to our shareholders. The timing of our repayment is contingent upon our negotiations with the U.S. Government on terms and conditions and the absence of any significant adverse economic or capital markets developments.   Issues and Outlook   For the remainder of 2010, significant issues include:       ·   Potential unstable credit markets that can impact our financing alternatives, spreads and other-than-temporary securities impairments;        ·   Potential volatile equity markets that have a significant impact on our hedge program performance and revenues;        ·   Continuation of the low interest rate environment, which affects the investment margins and reserve levels for many of our products, such as fixed annuities, UL and the fixed portion of defined contribution and VUL business;        ·   Achieving continued sales success with our portfolio of products, including marketplace acceptance of new variable annuity features, as well as retaining management and wholesaler talent to maintain our competitive position;        ·   Maturity of credit facilities in the first quarter of 2011 and related letters of credit (“LOCs”) that may remain outstanding until the first quarter of 2012 that support our life insurance business, and evolving treatment of reserve financing by rating agencies;        ·   Evaluating our ability to and the timing of when we may seek to repay the TARP CPP preferred stock funds and negotiating with the U.S. Government on the terms of repayment, which may be subject to conditions, including a requirement that we raise additional capital; and        ·   Continuing focus by the government on tax and healthcare reform including potential changes in company dividends-received deduction (“DRD”) calculations, which may affect the value and profitability of our products and overall earnings.           57           In the face of these issues and potential issues, we expect to focus on the following throughout the remainder of 2010:       ·   Executing on our plan to repay the U.S. Government $950 million related to the preferred stock that we issued for our participation in the TARP CPP as discussed further above;        ·   Executing on financing strategies addressing the statutory reserve strain and expiring credit facilities related to our secondary guarantee UL products in order to manage our capital position effectively in accordance with our pricing guidelines;        ·   Increasing our product development activities together with identifying future product development initiatives, with a focus on further reducing risk related to guaranteed benefit riders available with certain variable annuity contracts;        ·   Making targeted strategic investments in our businesses to grow revenues and further spur productivity, particularly in Retirement Solutions – Defined Contribution and Insurance Solutions – Group Protection, with technology upgrades and new products for the voluntary market and an expanded distribution focus for our group business;        ·   Managing our expenses aggressively through process improvement initiatives combined with continued financial discipline and execution excellence throughout our operations; and        ·   Closely monitoring our capital and liquidity positions taking into account the fragile economic recovery and changing statutory accounting and reserving practices.      For additional factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in this section, see “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2009 Form 10-K and “Forward-Looking Statements – Cautionary Language” above.   Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates   The MD&A included in our 2009 Form 10-K contains a detailed discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates. The following information updates the “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” provided in our 2009 Form 10-K and, accordingly, should be read in conjunction with the “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” discussed in our 2009 Form 10-K.   DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL   On a quarterly basis, we may record an adjustment to the amounts included within our Consolidated Balance Sheets for DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL with an offsetting benefit or charge to revenue or expense for the impact of the difference between future expected gross profits (“EGPs”) used in the prior quarter and the emergence of actual and updated future EGPs in the current quarter (“retrospective unlocking”). In addition, in the third quarter of each year, we conduct our annual comprehensive review of the assumptions and the projection models used for our estimates of future gross profits underlying the amortization of DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL and the calculations of the embedded derivatives and reserves for life insurance and annuity products with living benefit and death benefit guarantees. These assumptions include investment margins, mortality, retention, rider utilization and maintenance expenses (costs associated with maintaining records relating to insurance and individual and group annuity contracts and with the processing of premium collections, deposits, withdrawals and commissions). Based on our review, the cumulative balances of DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL, included on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, are adjusted with an offsetting benefit or charge to revenue or amortization expense to reflect such change (“prospective unlocking – assumption changes”). We may have prospective unlocking in other quarters as we become aware of information that warrants updating outside of our annual comprehensive review. We may also identify and implement actuarial modeling refinements (“prospective unlocking – model refinements”) that result in increases or decreases to the carrying values of DAC, VOBA, DSI, DFEL, embedded derivatives and reserves for life insurance and annuity products with living benefit and death benefit guarantees. The primary distinction between retrospective and prospective unlocking is that retrospective unlocking is driven by the difference between actual gross profits compared to EGPs each period, while prospective unlocking is driven by changes in assumptions or projection models related to our projections of future EGPs.   In discussing our results of operations below in this MD&A, we refer to favorable and unfavorable unlocking. With respect to DAC, VOBA and DSI, favorable unlocking refers to a decrease in the amortization expense in the period, whereas unfavorable unlocking refers to an increase in the amortization expense in the period. With respect to DFEL, favorable unlocking refers to an increase in the amortization income in the period, whereas unfavorable unlocking refers to a decrease in the amortization income in the period. With respect to the calculations of the embedded derivatives and reserves for life insurance and annuity products with living benefit and death benefit guarantees, favorable unlocking refers to a decrease in reserves in the period, whereas unfavorable unlocking refers to an increase in reserves in the period.   We amortize DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL in proportion to our EGPs. When actual gross profits are higher in the period than expected, we recognize more amortization. When actual gross profits are lower in the period than expected, we recognize less amortization. In a calendar year where the gross profits for a certain group of policies, or “cohorts,” are expected to be negative, we record no amortization expense rather than recording negative amortization in that year.        58           During the first quarter of 2010, there was a $21 million favorable prospective unlocking of DAC and VOBA from assumption changes due to including an estimate in our models for rider fees related to our annuity products with living benefit guarantees.   Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities   We have investments in two credit-linked notes (“CLNs”) that are deemed to be variable interest entities (“VIEs”). Effective January 1, 2010, in accordance with new accounting guidance (see Note 2), we determined that we are the primary beneficiary of these VIEs. As such, we reflected the financial condition and results of operations of these VIEs in our consolidated financial statements and recorded a cumulative effect adjustment of $169 million, after-tax, to the beginning balance of retained earnings as of January 1, 2010.    We use assumptions, estimates and judgments similar to those used for our investments and derivatives in determining the results of operations and financial position of these VIEs. In addition, we use judgments in concluding whether we are the primary beneficiary of these VIEs. Specifically, judgment is required in situations where our economic interest in the VIE is significantly greater than our stated power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the VIE.   See Note 4 for more detail regarding the consolidation of these VIEs.   Investments   Investment Valuation   As of March 31, 2010, we evaluated the markets that our securities trade in and concluded that none were inactive. We will continue to re-evaluate this conclusion, as needed, based on market conditions. We use an internationally recognized pricing service as our primary pricing source, and we generally do not obtain multiple prices for our financial instruments. We generally use prices from the pricing service rather than broker quotes as we have documentation from the pricing service on the observable market inputs that they use to determine the prices in contrast to the broker quotes where we have limited information on the pricing inputs. As of March 31, 2010, we only obtained multiple prices for 72 available-for-sale and trading securities. These multiple prices were primarily related to instances where the vendor was providing a price for the first time and we also received a broker quote. In these instances, we used the price from the pricing service due to the higher reliability as discussed above. As of March 31, 2010, we used broker quotes for 226 securities as our final price source, representing less than 5% of total securities owned.   Derivatives   We use derivative instruments to manage a variety of equity market and interest rate risks that are inherent in many of our life insurance and annuity products. Assessing the effectiveness of these hedging programs and evaluating the carrying values of the related derivatives often involve a variety of assumptions and estimates. We use derivatives to hedge equity market risks, interest rate risk and foreign currency exposures that are embedded in our annuity and life insurance product liabilities or investment portfolios. Derivatives held as of March 31, 2010, contain industry standard terms. Our accounting policies for derivatives and the potential impact on interest spreads in a falling rate environment are discussed in “Part I – Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” and Note 6 of this report and “Part II – Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” and Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2009 Form 10-K.   Guaranteed Living Benefits   As of March 31, 2010, the fair values of the embedded derivative reserves, before adjustment for the required NPR factors, for the guaranteed withdrawal benefit (“GWB”) feature, the i4LIFE® Advantage guaranteed income benefit (“GIB”) feature and the 4LATER® Advantage GIB feature were $169 million, $155 million and $137 million, respectively. See “Realized Loss – Operating Realized Gain – GLB” for information on how we determine our NPR.   As of March 31, 2010, the fair value of our derivative assets, which hedge both our GLB and GDB features, and including margins generated by futures contracts, was $935 million. As of March 31, 2010, the sum of all GLB liabilities at fair value, excluding the NPR adjustment, and GDB reserves was $520 million, comprised of $461 million for GLB liabilities and $59 million for the GDB reserves. The fair value of the hedge assets exceeded the liabilities by $415 million. However, the relationship of hedge assets to the liabilities for the guarantees may vary in any given reporting period due to market conditions, hedge performance and/or changes to the hedging strategy.   Approximately 41% of our variable annuity account values contain a GWB rider as of March 31, 2010. Declines in the equity markets increase our exposure to potential benefits under the GWB contracts, leading to an increase in our existing liability for those benefits. For example, a GWB contract is “in the money” if the contract holder’s account balance falls below the guaranteed amount. As of March 31, 2010, and March 31, 2009, 47% and 91% respectively, of all GWB in-force contracts were “in the money,” and our exposure to the guaranteed amounts, after reinsurance, as of March 31, 2010, and March 31, 2009, was $1.7 billion and $5.7 billion, respectively. Our exposure before reinsurance for these same periods was $2.0 billion and $6.4 billion, respectively. The ultimate amount to be paid by us related to GWB guarantees is uncertain and could be significantly more or less than $1.7 billion, net of reinsurance.   For information on our GLB and GDB hedging results, see our discussion in “Realized Loss” below.          59           Acquisitions and Dispositions   For information about acquisitions and divestitures, see Note 3 in this report and “Part I – Item 1.

The increase in net income was partially offset by the following:       ·   Higher DAC and VOBA amortization, net of interest and excluding unlocking, due primarily to a higher amortization rate from the reduction of projected EGPs being applied to the higher actual gross profits in the first quarter of 2010 and recording no amortization in 2009 for certain cohorts, discussed below in “Retirement Solutions – Annuities – Additional Information”;        ·   A $42 million gain in the first quarter of 2009 associated with the early extinguishment of long-term debt;        ·   An increase in federal income tax expense due primarily to an increase in earnings and favorable tax return true-ups in the first quarter of 2009 driven by the separate account DRD, foreign tax credit adjustments and other items; and        ·   Higher underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses, excluding amortization of DAC and VOBA, due primarily to:            §   Higher account value-based trail commissions driven by positive net flows and the impact of favorable equity markets on account values; and            §   Higher broker-dealer expenses due primarily to higher sales of non-proprietary products; partially offset by            §   Lower expenses attributable to our U.S. pension plans in the first quarter of 2010 and restructuring charges related to expense reduction initiatives in the first quarter of 2009.      The foregoing items are discussed in further detail in results of operations by segment discussions and “Realized Loss” below. In addition, for a discussion of the earnings impact of the equity markets, see “Part I – Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – Equity Market Risk – Impact of Equity Market Sensitivity.”            63           RESULTS OF RETIREMENT SOLUTIONS   The Retirement Solutions business provides its products through two segments: Annuities and Defined Contribution. The Retirement Solutions – Annuities segment provides tax-deferred investment growth and lifetime income opportunities for its clients by offering individual fixed annuities, including indexed annuities, and variable annuities. The Retirement Solutions – Defined Contribution segment provides employer-sponsored variable and fixed annuities and mutual-fund based programs in the 401(k), 403(b) and 457 marketplaces.   For factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in this section, see “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2009 Form 10-K and “Forward-Looking Statements – Cautionary Language” above.   Retirement Solutions – Annuities   Income from Operations   Details underlying the results for Retirement Solutions – Annuities (in millions) were as follows:           For the Three                Months Ended                March 31,                2010       2009       Change      Operating Revenues                      Insurance premiums (1)    $ 10     $ 27       -63 %   Insurance fees      260       182       43 %   Net investment income      271       240       13 %   Operating realized gain      15       12       25 %   Other revenues and fees (2)      74       61       21 %   Total operating revenues      630       522       21 %   Operating Expenses                            Interest credited      176       164       7 %   Benefits      44       75       -41 %   Underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other                             expenses      260       220       18 %   Total operating expenses      480       459       5 %   Income from operations before taxes      150       63       138 %   Federal income tax expense (benefit)      31       (11 )    NM      Income from operations    $ 119     $ 74       61 %         (1)   Includes primarily our single premium immediate annuities, which have a corresponding offset in benefits for changes in reserves.        (2)   Consists primarily of broker-dealer earnings that are subject to market volatility.      Comparison of the Three Months Ended March 31, 2010 to 2009   Income from operations for this segment increased due primarily to the following:       ·   Higher insurance fees driven primarily by higher average daily variable account values due to more favorable equity markets;        ·   A $24 million favorable retrospective unlocking of DAC, VOBA, DSI, DFEL and reserves for our guarantee riders in the first quarter of 2010, partially offset by higher DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL amortization, net of interest and excluding unlocking, compared to a $7 million unfavorable retrospective unlocking in the first quarter of 2009:            §   The favorable retrospective unlocking for the first quarter of 2010 was due primarily to higher equity market performance, higher expense assessments and lower lapses than our model projections assumed;           64                         §    The higher amortization for the first quarter of 2010 was due primarily to a higher amortization rate from the reduction of projected EGPs for this segment being applied to the higher actual gross profits in the first quarter of 2010 (discussed in “Additional Information” below) and recording no amortization in 2009 for certain cohorts, discussed below; and             §   The unfavorable retrospective unlocking for the first quarter of 2009 was due primarily to higher lapses, higher death benefit costs and the impact of lower equity market performance than our model projections assumed;        ·   A $21 million favorable prospective unlocking of DAC and VOBA in the first quarter of 2010 from assumption changes due to including an estimate in our models for rider fees related to our annuity products with living benefit guarantees; and        ·   Higher net investment income, partially offset by higher interest credited, excluding unlocking, driven primarily by:            §   Higher average fixed account values, including the fixed portion of variable annuity contracts, attributable primarily to positive net flows;            §   Holding lower cash balances in the first quarter of 2010 that increased our portfolio yields (see discussion in “Additional Information” below); and            §   More favorable investment income on surplus investments due primarily to more favorable investment income on alternative investments as a result of improvement in the capital markets (see “Consolidated Investments – Alternative Investments” below for additional information).      The increase in income from operations was partially offset by the following:       ·   An increase in federal income tax expense due primarily to an increase in earnings and favorable tax return true-ups in the first quarter of 2009 driven by the separate account DRD, foreign tax credit adjustments and other items;        ·   Higher underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses, excluding amortization of DAC and VOBA, due primarily to:            §   Higher account value-based trail commissions driven by positive net flows;            §   The effect of favorable equity markets on account values; and            §   An increase in the allocation of overhead costs to this segment, discussed in “Additional Information” below; partially offset by            §   Lower expenses attributable to our U.S. pension plans, discussed in “Additional Information” below; and        ·   Lower benefits from a decrease in the change in GDB reserves due to a decrease in our expected GDB benefit payments attributable primarily to the increase in account values above guaranteed levels due to the more favorable equity markets.      Additional Information   We are in the process of completing a conversion of our actuarial valuation systems to a uniform valuation platform. This conversion is a continuation of merger-related activities to harmonize methods and processes and involves an upgrade to a critical platform for our financial reporting and analysis capabilities. As part of this conversion process, we are harmonizing assumptions and methods of calculations that exist between similar blocks of business within our actuarial models. This exercise may result in one-time gain and loss adjustments to our results of operations and may result in changes to earnings trends. Although we expect some differences to emerge as a result of this exercise, based upon the current status of these efforts, we are not able to provide an estimate or range of the effects to our results of operations from any differences that may exist upon completion of the conversion. We expect to substantially complete the most critical phases of the conversion by the end of the third quarter of 2010.   Prior to the second quarter of 2009, the equity markets unfavorably impacted our average variable account values and the resulting fees earned on these accounts. Additionally, weaker credit fundamentals negatively impacted our investment margins and increased our realized losses on investments, including OTTI. As a result, we recorded prospective unlocking during the fourth quarter of 2008 related to our “reversion to the mean” process, as discussed in “Critical Accounting Policies – DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL” in our 2009 Form 10-K. This RTM unlocking that occurred at an equity market trough had the impact of lowering the projected EGPs for this segment, thereby increasing our rate of amortization, which will result in higher DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL amortization and lower earnings for this segment.   Deposits moderated in the fourth quarter of 2009 and the first quarter of 2010, as customers shifted deposits back into variable annuity products as equity markets improved, and we expect this trend to continue during the remainder of 2010 with improving economic conditions.   We allocated more overhead costs to this segment during the first quarter of 2010, and we expect this trend will continue in the remaining quarters of 2010, as the disposal of our Lincoln UK and Investment Management businesses resulted in a reallocation of overhead expenses to our remaining businesses. See “Acquisitions and Dispositions” in our 2009 Form 10-K for additional details. Additionally, we plan to make strategic investments during 2010 that will also result in higher expenses.          65           During the volatile markets experienced in late 2008 and early 2009, we implemented a short-term liquidity strategy of maintaining higher cash balances that reduced our portfolio yields by 40 basis points during the first quarter of 2009. As we progressed through 2009, we reduced these excess cash balances; therefore, there was no impact to our portfolio yields for the first quarter of 2010.   We experienced a favorable decline in expenses attributable to our U.S. pension plans during the first quarter of 2010 when compared to the corresponding period of 2009, and we expect this trend will continue in the remaining quarters of 2010. For additional information, see “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans” in our 2009 Form 10-K.   New deposits are an important component of net flows and key to our efforts to grow our business. Although deposits do not significantly impact current period income from operations, they are an important indicator of future profitability.   The other component of net flows relates to the retention of the business. An important measure of retention is the lapse rate, which compares the amount of withdrawals to the average account values. The overall lapse rate for our annuity products was 7% for the first quarter of 2010 compared to 10% for the corresponding period in 2009.   See Note 8 for information on contractual guarantees to contract holders related to GDB features for our Retirement Solutions business.   Our fixed annuity business includes products with discretionary crediting rates that are reset on an annual basis and are not subject to surrender charges. Account values for these products, including the fixed portion of variable annuities, were $7.0 billion as of March 31, 2010. Using second quarter of 2010 declared rates, 72% were already at their minimum guaranteed rates, and the average crediting rates for these products were approximately 35 basis points in excess of average minimum guaranteed rates. Our ability to retain annual reset annuities will be subject to current competitive conditions at the time interest rates for these products reset.   We expect to manage the effects of spreads on near-term income from operations through portfolio management and, to a lesser extent, crediting rate actions, which assumes no significant changes in net flows into or out of our fixed accounts or other changes that may cause interest rate spreads to differ from our expectations. For information on interest rate spreads and the interest rate risk due to falling interest rates, see “Part II – Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – Interest Rate Risk on Fixed Insurance Business – Falling Rates” in our 2009 Form 10-K.   We provide information about this segment’s operating revenue and operating expense line items, the period in which amounts are recognized, key drivers of changes and historical details underlying the line items and their associated drivers below.

These assessments are a function of the rates priced into the product and the average daily variable account values. Average daily account values are driven by net flows and the equity markets. In addition, for our fixed annuity contracts and for some variable contracts, we collect surrender charges when contract holders surrender their contracts during their surrender charge periods to protect us from premature withdrawals. Insurance fees include charges on both our variable and fixed annuity products, but exclude the attributed fees on our GLB products; see “Realized Loss – Operating Realized Gain – GLB” below for discussion of these attributed fees.

We expect to earn a spread between what we earn on the underlying general account investments supporting the fixed annuity product line, including the fixed portion of variable annuity contracts, and what we credit to our fixed annuity contract holders’ accounts, including the fixed portion of variable annuity contracts. The interest rate spread for this segment represents the excess of the yield on invested assets on reserves over the average crediting rate. The yield on invested assets on reserves is calculated as net investment income, excluding the amounts attributable to our surplus investments, reverse repurchase agreement interest expense, inter-segment cash management program interest expense and interest on collateral divided by average invested assets on reserves. The average invested assets on reserves is calculated based upon total invested assets, excluding hedge derivatives and collateral. The average crediting rate is calculated as interest credited before DSI amortization, plus the immediate annuity reserve change (included within benefits) divided by the average fixed account values, including the fixed portion of variable annuity contracts, net of coinsured account values. Fixed account values reinsured under modified coinsurance agreements are included in account values for this calculation. Changes in commercial mortgage loan prepayments and bond makewhole premiums, investment income on alternative investments and surplus investment income can vary significantly from period to period due to a number of factors and, therefore, may contribute to investment income results that are not indicative of the underlying trends.   Benefits   Benefits for this segment include changes in reserves of immediate annuity account values driven by premiums, changes in GDB and GLB benefit reserves and our expected costs associated with purchases of derivatives used to hedge our GDB benefit ratio unlocking.          69           Underwriting, Acquisition, Insurance and Other Expenses   Details underlying underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses (in millions) were as follows:           For the Three                Months Ended                March 31,                2010       2009       Change      Underwriting, Acquisition, Insurance and                      Other Expenses                      Commissions    $ 150     $ 125       20 %   General and administrative expenses      78       72       8 %   Taxes, licenses and fees      8       5       60 %   Total expenses incurred, excluding                            broker-dealer      236       202       17 %   DAC and VOBA deferrals      (132 )     (128 )     -3 %   Total pre-broker-dealer expenses incurred,                            excluding amortization, net of interest      104       74       41 %   DAC and VOBA amortization, net of interest:                            Prospective unlocking - assumption changes      (32 )     -      NM      Retrospective unlocking      (28 )     18      NM      Amortization, net of interest, excluding                            unlocking      141       63       124 %   Broker-dealer expenses incurred      75       65       15 %   Total underwriting, acquisition,                            insurance and other expenses    $ 260     $ 220       18 %   DAC and VOBA Deferrals                            As a percentage of sales/deposits      5.8 %     5.9 %             Commissions and other costs that vary with and are related primarily to the production of new business are deferred to the extent recoverable and are amortized over the lives of the contracts in relation to EGPs. Certain of our commissions are expensed as incurred rather than deferred and amortized. These non-deferred commissions, which include trail commissions that are based upon account values, were approximately $53 million for the first quarter of 2010 compared to approximately $32 million for the corresponding period in 2009.   Broker-dealer expenses that vary with and are related to sales are expensed as incurred and not deferred and amortized. Fluctuations in these expenses correspond with fluctuations in other revenues and fees.    The increase in amortization, net of interest, excluding unlocking, when comparing the three months ended March 31, 2010 to 2009, was due to a higher amortization rate from the reduction of projected EGPs for this segment being applied to the higher actual gross profits in the first quarter of 2010 (discussed above in “Additional Information”) and recording no amortization in 2009 for certain cohorts, discussed below.  During 2009, we had unfavorable hedge program performance and securities impairments that resulted in negative gross profits in total for certain cohorts. As a result, the amortization of DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL for those cohorts in 2010 was significantly higher than it was in the previous year, as we recorded no amortization in 2009 for these cohorts.          70           Retirement Solutions – Defined Contribution   Income from Operations   Details underlying the results for Retirement Solutions – Defined Contribution (in millions) were as follows:           For the Three                Months Ended                March 31,                2010       2009       Change      Operating Revenues                      Insurance fees    $ 50     $ 41       22 %   Net investment income      186       175       6 %   Other revenues and fees      4       2       100 %   Total operating revenues      240       218       10 %   Operating Expenses                            Interest credited      110       111       -1 %   Benefits      2       (2 )     200 %   Underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other                            expenses      78       72       8 %   Total operating expenses      190       181       5 %   Income from operations before taxes      50       37       35 %   Federal income tax expense      14       7       100 %   Income from operations    $ 36     $ 30       20 %     Comparison of the Three Months Ended March 31, 2010 to 2009   Income from operations for this segment increased due primarily to the following:       ·   Higher net investment income and relatively flat interest credited, driven primarily by:            §   Higher average fixed account values, including the fixed portion of variable annuity contracts, attributable primarily to transfers from variable to fixed since the first quarter of 2009;            §   Actions implemented during the third quarter of 2009 to reduce interest crediting rates;            §   Holding lower cash balances in the first quarter of 2010 that increased our portfolio yields (see discussion in “Additional Information” below); and            §   More favorable investment income on surplus and alternative investments due to the improvement in the capital markets (see “Consolidated Investments – Alternative Investments” below for additional information); and        ·   Higher insurance fees driven primarily by higher average daily variable account values due to more favorable equity markets, partially offset by an overall shift in business mix toward products with lower expense assessment rates.      The increase in income from operations was partially offset by the following:       ·   An increase in federal income tax expense due primarily to an increase in earnings and favorable tax return true-ups in the first quarter of 2009 attributable to the separate account DRD and other items; and        ·   Higher underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses, excluding unlocking, due primarily to:            §   Higher account value- based trail commissions driven by the effect of favorable equity markets on account values; and            §   An increase in the allocation of overhead costs to this segment in the first quarter of 2010, as discussed in “Additional Information” below; partially offset by            §   Lower DAC and VOBA amortization in the first quarter of 2009, net of interest, driven by the declines in our variable account values from unfavorable equity markets; and            §   Lower expenses attributable to our U.S. pension plans in the first quarter of 2010 (as discussed in “Additional Information” below).             71            Additional Information   We allocated more overhead costs to this segment during the first quarter of 2010, and we expect this trend will continue in the remaining quarters of 2010, as the disposal of our Lincoln UK and Investment Management businesses resulted in a reallocation of overhead expenses to our remaining businesses. See “Acquisitions and Dispositions” in our 2009 Form 10-K for additional details. Additionally, we plan to make strategic investments during 2010 to improve our infrastructure and product offerings that will also result in higher expenses.   We experienced a favorable decline in expenses attributable to our U.S. pension plans during the first quarter of 2010 when compared to the corresponding period of 2009, and we expect this trend will continue in the remaining quarters of 2010. For additional information, see “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans” in our 2009 Form 10-K.   During the volatile markets experienced in late 2008 and early 2009, we implemented a short term liquidity strategy of maintaining higher cash balances that reduced our portfolio yields by 16 basis points during the first quarter of 2009. As we progressed through 2009, we reduced these cash balances; therefore, there was no impact to our portfolio yields for the first quarter of 2010.   New deposits are an important component of net flows and key to our efforts to grow our business. Although deposits do not significantly impact current period income from operations, they are an important indicator of future profitability.   The other component of net flows relates to the retention of the business. An important measure of retention is the lapse rate, which compares the amount of withdrawals to the average account values. The overall lapse rate for our annuity and mutual fund products was 13% for the first quarter of 2010 compared to 11% for the corresponding period in 2009. Our lapse rate is negatively impacted by the continued net outflows from our oldest blocks of annuities business (as presented on our Account Value Roll Forward table below as “Total Multi-Fund® and Other Variable Annuities”), which are also our higher margin product lines in this segment, due to the fact that they are mature blocks with much of the account values out of surrender charge period. The proportion of these products to our total account values was 44% and 49% as of March 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Due to this expected overall shift in business mix toward products with lower returns, a significant increase in new deposit production will be necessary to maintain earnings at current levels.   See Note 8 for information on contractual guarantees to contract holders related to GDB features for our Retirement Solutions business.    The following provides information related to our rate setting products as of March 31, 2010, for our fixed annuity business, including the fixed portion of variable annuities, where crediting rates are reset on a quarterly basis (dollars in billions):           Discretionary       Index-based                Rate Setting       Rate Setting                Products       Products       Total      Total account values    $ 9.7     $ 2.7     $ 12.4     Percentage of account values already at their                            minimum guaranteed rates (1)      93 %     26 %     78 %   Average crediting rates in excess of average                            minimum guaranteed rates     11 bps       51 bps       20 bps            (1)   Based upon second quarter of 2010 declared rates.      Our ability to retain quarterly reset annuities will be subject to current competitive conditions at the time interest rates for these products reset.    We expect to manage the effects of spreads on near-term income from operations through portfolio management and, to a lesser extent, crediting rate actions, which assumes no significant changes in net flows into or out of our fixed accounts or other changes that may cause interest rate spreads to differ from our expectations.

Expense assessments are generally equal to a percentage of the daily variable account values. Average daily account values are driven by net flows and the equity markets. Our expense assessments include fees we earn for the services that we provide to our mutual fund programs. In addition, for both our fixed and variable annuity contracts, we collect surrender charges when contract holders surrender their contracts during the surrender charge periods to protect us from premature withdrawals.    When comparing the first quarter of 2010 to the corresponding period in 2009, our net flows declined due to 2009 benefiting from a few large deposits.         75           Net Investment Income and Interest Credited   Details underlying net investment income, interest credited (in millions) and our interest rate spread were as follows:           For the Three                Months Ended                March 31,                2010       2009       Change      Net Investment Income                      Fixed maturity securities, mortgage loans on real                      estate and other, net of investment expenses    $ 173     $ 165       5 %   Alternative investments (1)      1       -      NM      Surplus investments (2)      12       10       20 %   Total net investment income    $ 186     $ 175       6 %   Interest Credited    $ 110     $ 111       -1 %         (1)   See “Consolidated Investments – Alternative Investments” below for additional information.

We expect to earn a spread between what we earn on the underlying general account investments supporting the fixed annuity product line, including the fixed portion of variable annuity contracts, and what we credit to our fixed annuity contract holders’ accounts, including the fixed portion of variable annuity contracts. The interest rate spread for this segment represents the excess of the yield on invested assets on reserves over the average crediting rate. The yield on invested assets on reserves is calculated as net investment income, excluding the amounts attributable to our surplus investments, reverse repurchase agreement interest expense, inter-segment cash management program interest expense and interest on collateral, divided by average invested assets on reserves. The average invested assets on reserves are calculated based upon total invested assets, excluding hedge derivatives. The average crediting rate is calculated as interest credited before DSI amortization, divided by the average fixed account values, including the fixed portion of variable annuity contracts. Commercial mortgage loan prepayments and bond makewhole premiums, investment income on alternative investments and surplus investment income can vary significantly from period to period due to a number of factors and, therefore, may contribute to investment income results that are not indicative of the underlying trends.   Benefits   Benefits for this segment include changes in GDB and GLB benefit reserves and our expected costs associated with purchases of derivatives used to hedge our GDB benefit ratio unlocking.          77           Underwriting, Acquisition, Insurance and Other Expenses   Details underlying underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses (in millions) were as follows:           For the Three                Months Ended                March 31,                2010       2009       Change      Underwriting, Acquisition, Insurance and                      Other Expenses                      Commissions    $ 16     $ 14       14 %   General and administrative expenses      53       54       -2 %   Taxes, licenses and fees      4       4       0 %   Total expenses incurred      73       72       1 %   DAC deferrals      (16 )     (18 )     11 %   Total expenses recognized before                            amortization      57       54       6 %   DAC and VOBA amortization, net of interest:                            Retrospective unlocking      1       2       -50 %   Amortization, net of interest, excluding                            unlocking      20       16       25 %   Total underwriting, acquisition, insurance                            and other expenses    $ 78     $ 72       8 %   DAC Deferrals                            As a percentage of annuity sales/deposits      2.1 %     2.2 %             Commissions and other costs that vary with and are related primarily to the sale of annuity contracts are deferred to the extent recoverable and are amortized over the lives of the contracts in relation to EGPs. Certain of our commissions are expensed as incurred rather than deferred and amortized. These non-deferred commissions, which include trail commissions that are based upon account values, were approximately $9 million for the first quarter of 2010 compared to approximately $6 million for the corresponding period in 2009. We do not pay commissions on sales of our mutual fund products, and distribution expenses associated with the sale of these mutual fund products are expensed as incurred.                   78           RESULTS OF INSURANCE SOLUTIONS   The Insurance Solutions business provides its products through two segments: Life Insurance and Group Protection. The Insurance Solutions – Life Insurance segment offers wealth protection and transfer opportunities through term insurance, a linked-benefit product (which is a UL policy linked with riders that provide for long-term care costs) and both single and survivorship versions of UL and VUL, including corporate-owned UL and VUL (“COLI”) and bank-owned UL and VUL (“BOLI”) products. The Insurance Solutions – Group Protection segment offers group life, disability and dental insurance to employers.   For factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in this section, see “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2009 Form 10-K and “Forward-Looking Statements – Cautionary Language” above.   Insurance Solutions – Life Insurance   Income from Operations   Details underlying the results for Insurance Solutions – Life Insurance (in millions) were as follows:           For the Three                Months Ended                March 31,                2010       2009       Change      Operating Revenues                      Insurance premiums    $ 112     $ 91       23 %   Insurance fees      477       482       -1 %   Net investment income      530       498       6 %   Other revenues and fees      9       5       80 %   Total operating revenues      1,128       1,076       5 %   Operating Expenses                            Interest credited      297       303       -2 %   Benefits      399       356       12 %   Underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other                            expenses      230       224       3 %   Total operating expenses      926       883       5 %   Income from operations before taxes      202       193       5 %   Federal income tax expense      65       51       27 %   Income from operations    $ 137     $ 142       -4 %     Comparison of the Three Months Ended March 31, 2010 to 2009   Income from operations for this segment decreased due primarily to the following:       ·   An increase in federal income tax expense due primarily to favorable tax return true-ups in the first quarter of 2009;        ·   An increase in benefits attributable primarily to higher death claims;        ·   The inter-company reinsurance arrangement effective December 31, 2009, discussed below, which resulted in reductions in net investment income and an increase in underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses; and        ·   The transfer of a closed block of life insurance policies to a third party, discussed in “Additional Information” below, which resulted in reductions in insurance fees, net investment income, interest credited, benefits and underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses.             79           The decrease in income from operations was partially offset by the following:       ·   Higher net investment income and relatively flat interest credited due primarily to:            §   Actions implemented to reduce interest crediting rates, discussed in “Additional Information” below;            §   Growth in business in force; and            §   More favorable investment income on surplus and alternative investments due to the improvement in the capital markets, and higher prepayment and bond makewhole premiums due to improvement of the financial markets (see “Additional Information” and “Consolidated Investments – Alternative Investments” below for more information); and        ·   A decrease in underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses, excluding amortization, due primarily to:            §   Lower litigation accruals;            §   Lower expenses associated with integration of our administrative systems due to a wind-down of merger activities; and            §   Lower expenses attributable to our U.S. pension plans, discussed in “Additional Information” below; partially offset by            §   An increase in the allocation of overhead costs to this segment, discussed in “Additional Information” below.      We provide information about this segment’s operating revenue and operating expense line items, the period in which amounts are recognized, key drivers of changes and historical details underlying the line items and their associated drivers below.   Strategies to Address Statutory Reserve Strain   Our insurance subsidiaries have statutory surplus and RBC levels above current regulatory required levels. As mentioned below, approximately 61% of our life sales for the three months ended March 31, 2010, consisted of products containing secondary guarantees, which require reserves calculated under Actuarial Guideline 38, or The Application of the Valuation of Life Insurance Policies Model Regulation (“AG38”). Our insurance subsidiaries are employing strategies to reduce the strain of increasing AG38 and Valuation of Life Insurance Policies Model Regulation (“XXX”) statutory reserves associated with secondary guarantee UL and term products. As discussed further below, we have been successful in executing reinsurance solutions to release capital to Other Operations. We expect to regularly execute transactions designed to release capital as we continue to sell products that are subject to these reserving requirements. We also plan to refinance prior transactions as discussed further below. Recently, we introduced new secondary guarantee UL products that achieve our return requirements without dependency on such reinsurance solutions.   Included in the LOCs issued as of March 31, 2010, reported in the credit facilities table below in “Review of Consolidated Financial Condition – Liquidity and Capital Resources – Financing Activities,” was approximately $1.7 billion of LOCs supporting the reinsurance obligations of Lincoln National Reinsurance Company (Barbados) Limited on UL business with secondary guarantees. The underlying credit facilities mature in the first quarter of 2011; however, the LOCs may remain outstanding until the first quarter of 2012. We expect to replace these existing LOCs with a mix of long-term financing solutions as well as new shorter-term LOCs. We previously executed a long-term structured solution of approximately $400 million in 2007. LOCs and related capital market alternatives lower the capital impact of secondary guarantee UL products. An inability to obtain the necessary LOC capacity or other capital market alternatives could impact our returns on our in-force secondary guarantee UL business. However, we believe that our insurance subsidiaries have sufficient capital to support the increase in statutory reserves if such structures are not available. See “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors – Attempts to mitigate the impact of Regulation XXX and Actuarial Guideline 38 may fail in whole or in part resulting in an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations” in our 2009 Form 10-K for further information on XXX reserves.   As of December 31, 2009, we released approximately $400 million of capital that had previously supported statutory reserves related to our term products as a result of executing on a letter of credit transaction with a third party to support an inter-company reinsurance arrangement. As part of this transaction, we entered into a $550 million 10-year LOC related to this business. For more information on this transaction, see our current report on Form 8-K filed on January 7, 2010. This reduction in capital lowered the level of invested assets required to support the reserves of this business, which we transferred to Other Operations where we maintain capital not allocated to our businesses. The cost of the LOC reflected in underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses, together with the impact of lower net investment income associated with assets shifting from backing reserves in this segment to surplus in Other Operations, will reduce this segment’s quarterly income from operations beginning in 2010 by approximately $7 million, $4 million of which is simply a shift to Other Operations due to the transfer of invested assets.          80           Additional Information   We are in the process of completing a conversion of our actuarial valuation systems to a uniform valuation platform. This conversion is a continuation of merger-related activities to harmonize methods and processes and involves an upgrade to a critical platform for our financial reporting and analysis capabilities. As part of this conversion process, we are harmonizing assumptions and methods of calculations that exist between similar blocks of business within our actuarial models. This exercise may result in one-time gain and loss adjustments to our results of operations and may result in changes to earnings trends. Although we expect some differences to emerge as a result of this exercise, based upon the current status of these efforts, we are not able to provide an estimate or range of the effects to our results of operations from any differences that may exist upon completion of the conversion. We expect to substantially complete the most critical phases of the conversion by the end of the third quarter of 2010.   We allocated more overhead costs to this segment during the first quarter of 2010, and we expect this trend will continue in the remaining quarters of 2010, as the disposal of our Lincoln UK and Investment Management businesses resulted in a reallocation of overhead expenses to our remaining businesses. See “Acquisitions and Dispositions” in our 2009 Form 10-K for additional details. Additionally, we plan to make strategic investments during 2010 that will also result in higher expenses.   We experienced a favorable decline in expenses attributable to our U.S. pension plans during the first quarter of 2010 when compared to the corresponding period of 2009, and we expect this trend will continue in the remaining quarters of 2010. For additional information, see “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans” in our 2009 Form 10-K.   Effective March 31, 2009, we transferred a closed block of business consisting of certain UL and VUL insurance products to a third party. During the fourth quarter of 2009, one of our insurance subsidiaries executed a separate agreement whereby we assumed the mortality risk associated with this business on a yearly-renewable basis. These transactions caused an approximate $6 million per quarter ongoing reduction in this segment’s income from operations as a result of reductions in insurance fees and net investment income, partially offset by reductions in interest credited and benefits. The assumption of the mortality risk associated with this business on a yearly-renewable basis resulted in an approximate $13 million per quarter ongoing increase in insurance premiums offset by an increase in benefits. The unfavorable impact to this segment’s income from operations was partially offset by an approximate $2 million per quarter ongoing increase to income from operations in Other Operations, as a result of having higher net investment income due to the transfer of invested assets from Insurance Solutions – Life Insurance. The transfer of invested assets from this segment was attributable to a reduction in capital as a result of the transfer of this business to a third party. These transactions caused a net $4 million per quarter ongoing reduction to our consolidated net income. Effective April 1, 2010, the agreement to assume the mortality risk associated with this business on a yearly-renewable basis was rescinded and replaced with an inter-company reinsurance agreement that effectively resulted in no change to the impact discussed above.   On January 1, 2010, we implemented a 20 basis point decrease in crediting rates on most interest-sensitive products not already at contractual guarantees, which reduced crediting rates by approximately 3 basis points. On March 1, 2009, we implemented a 15 basis point decrease in crediting rates on most interest-sensitive products not already at contractual guarantees, which reduced crediting rates by approximately 5 basis points.   As of March 31, 2010, 76% of interest-sensitive account values had crediting rates at contract guaranteed levels, and 12% had crediting rates within 50 basis points of contractual guarantees. We expect to manage the effects of spreads on near-term income from operations through portfolio management and, to a lesser extent, crediting rate actions, which assumes no significant changes in net flows into or out of our fixed accounts or other changes that may cause interest rate spreads to differ from our expectations. For information on interest rate spreads and the interest rate risk due to falling interest rates, see “Part II – Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – Interest Rate Risk on Fixed Insurance Business – Falling Rates” in our 2009 Form 10-K.   Sales are not recorded as a component of revenues (other than for traditional products) and do not have a significant impact on current quarter income from operations but are indicators of future profitability. Generally, we have higher sales during the second half of the year with the fourth quarter being our strongest.   Insurance Premiums   Insurance premiums relate to traditional products and are a function of the rates priced into the product and the level of insurance in force. Insurance in force, in turn, is driven by sales, persistency and mortality experience.          81           Insurance Fees   Details underlying insurance fees, sales, net flows, account values and in-force face amount (in millions) were as follows:           For the Three                Months Ended                March 31,                2010       2009       Change      Insurance Fees                      Mortality assessments    $ 318     $ 344       -8 %   Expense assessments      199       178       12 %   Surrender charges      31       22       41 %   DFEL:                            Deferrals      (118 )     (97 )     -22 %   Amortization, net of interest:                            Retrospective unlocking      8       3       167 %   Amortization, net of interest, excluding                            unlocking      39       32       22 %   Total insurance fees    $ 477     $ 482       -1 %             For the Three                Months Ended                March 31,                2010       2009       Change      Sales by Product                      UL:                      Excluding MoneyGuard®    $ 90     $ 103       -13 %   MoneyGuard®      18       11       64 %   Total UL      108       114       -5 %   VUL      8       9       -11 %   COLI and BOLI      7       12       -42 %   Term/whole life      20       10       100 %   Total sales    $ 143     $ 145       -1 %   Net Flows                            Deposits    $ 1,077     $ 1,058       2 %   Withdrawals and deaths      (475 )     (501 )     5 %   Net flows    $ 602     $ 557       8 %                              Contract holder assessments    $ 763     $ 725       5 %            82                       As of March 31,                2010       2009       Change      Account Values                      UL    $ 25,194     $ 24,388       3 %   VUL      4,629       3,352       38 %   Interest-sensitive whole life      2,251       2,291       -2 %   Total account values    $ 32,074     $ 30,031       7 %                              In-Force Face Amount                            UL and other    $ 292,204     $ 288,826       1 %   Term insurance (1)      254,115       236,408       7 %   Total in-force face amount    $ 546,319     $ 525,234       4 %         (1)   Excludes $19.8 billion of face amount in force associated with our assumption of the mortality risk effective October 1, 2009, on the block of business discussed in “Additional Information” above.      Insurance fees relate only to interest-sensitive products and include mortality assessments, expense assessments (net of deferrals and amortization related to DFEL) and surrender charges. Mortality and expense assessments are deducted from our contract holders’ account values. These amounts are a function of the rates priced into the product and premiums received, face amount in force and account values. Insurance in force, in turn, is driven by sales, persistency and mortality experience. In-force growth should be considered independently with respect to term products versus UL and other products, as term products have a lower profitability relative to face amount compared to whole life and interest-sensitive products.   Sales in the table above and as discussed above were reported as follows:       ·   UL (excluding linked-benefit products) and VUL (including COLI and BOLI) – first year commissionable premiums plus 5% of excess premiums received, including an adjustment for internal replacements of approximately 50% of commissionable premiums;        ·   MoneyGuard® (our linked-benefit product) – 15% of premium deposits; and        ·   Whole life and term – 100% of first year paid premiums.      UL and VUL products with secondary guarantees represented approximately 40% of interest-sensitive life insurance in force as of March 31, 2010, and approximately 61% of sales for the first three months of 2010. Actuarial Guideline 37, or Variable Life Reserves for Guaranteed Minimum Death Benefits, and AG38 impose additional statutory reserve requirements for these products.          83           Net Investment Income and Interest Credited   Details underlying net investment income, interest credited (in millions) and our interest rate spread were as follows:           For the Three                Months Ended                March 31,                2010       2009       Change      Net Investment Income                      Fixed maturity securities, mortgage loans on real                      estate and other, net of investment expenses    $ 489     $ 481       2 %   Commercial mortgage loan prepayment and                            bond makewhole premiums (1)      4       -      NM      Alternative investments (2)      13       (4 )    NM      Surplus investments (3)      24       21       14 %   Total net investment income    $ 530     $ 498       6 %                              Interest Credited    $ 297     $ 303       -2 %         (1)   See “Consolidated Investments – Commercial Mortgage Loan Prepayment and Bond Makewhole Premiums” below for additional information.

A portion of the investment income earned for this segment is credited to contract holder accounts. Invested assets will typically grow at a faster rate than account values because of the AG38 reserve requirements, which cause statutory reserves to grow at a faster rate than account values. Invested assets are based upon the statutory reserve liabilities and are therefore affected by various reserve adjustments, including capital transactions providing relief from AG38 reserve requirements, which leads to a transfer of invested assets from this segment to Other Operations for use in other corporate purposes. We expect to earn a spread between what we earn on the underlying general account investments and what we credit to our contract holders’ accounts. The interest rate spread for this segment represents the excess of the yield on invested assets on reserves over the average crediting rate on interest-sensitive products. The yield on invested assets on reserves is calculated as net investment income, excluding amounts attributable to our surplus investments and reverse repurchase agreement interest expense, divided by average invested assets on reserves. In addition, we exclude the impact of earnings from affordable housing tax credit securities, which is reflected as a reduction to federal income tax expense, from our spread calculations. Traditional products use interest income to build the policy reserves. Commercial mortgage loan prepayments and bond makewhole premiums and investment income on alternative investments can vary significantly from period to period due to a number of factors, and, therefore, may contribute to investment income results that are not indicative of the underlying trends.   Benefits   Details underlying benefits (dollars in millions) were as follows:           For the Three                Months Ended                March 31,                2010       2009       Change      Benefits                      Death claims direct and assumed    $ 666     $ 565       18 %   Death claims ceded      (297 )     (242 )     -23 %   Reserves released on death      (117 )     (103 )     -14 %   Net death benefits      252       220       15 %   Change in secondary guarantee life insurance                            product reserves      75       53       42 %   Change in secondary guarantee life insurance                            product reserves - reinsurance      1       20       -95 %   Other benefits (1)      71       63       13 %   Total benefits    $ 399     $ 356       12 %                              Death claims per $1,000 of inforce      1.85       1.61       15 %         (1)   Includes primarily traditional product changes in reserves and dividends.           85           Benefits for this segment includes claims incurred during the period in excess of the associated reserves for its interest-sensitive and traditional products. In addition, benefits includes the change in secondary guarantee life insurance product reserves. The reserve for secondary guarantees is impacted by changes in expected future trends of expense assessments causing unlocking adjustments to this liability similar to DAC, VOBA and DFEL. Additionally, we establish a reserve for reinsurance margin (reinsurance premiums paid less death benefit recoveries) and amortize this margin over the life of the expected insurance assessments for certain blocks of secondary guarantee UL business. When we experience unfavorable mortality, particularly on higher face amount claims, our reinsurance recoveries can increase significantly and are deferred, which reduces the amount by which the expense for the direct claims are offset by reinsurance. The reinsurance on our secondary guarantee UL business is excess of loss reinsurance, and this block has a large range of face amounts, both of which contribute to volatility in our actual experience of reinsurance recoveries as compared to our expectations.   Underwriting, Acquisition, Insurance and Other Expenses   Details underlying underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses (in millions) were as follows:           For the Three                Months Ended                March 31,                2010       2009       Change      Underwriting, Acquisition, Insurance and                      Other Expenses                      Commissions    $ 167     $ 177       -6 %   General and administrative expenses      107       110       -3 %   Taxes, licenses and fees      32       33       -3 %   Total expenses incurred      306       320       -4 %   DAC and VOBA deferrals      (223 )     (224 )     0 %   Total expenses recognized before amortization      83       96       -14 %   DAC and VOBA amortization, net of interest:                            Retrospective unlocking      15       13       15 %   Amortization, net of interest, excluding                            unlocking      131       114       15 %   Other intangible amortization      1       1       0 %   Total underwriting, acquisition, insurance                            and other expenses    $ 230     $ 224       3 %   DAC and VOBA Deferrals                            As a percentage of sales      155.9 %     154.5 %             Commissions and other general and administrative expenses that vary with and are related primarily to the production of new business are deferred to the extent recoverable and for our interest-sensitive products are generally amortized over the lives of the contracts in relation to EGPs.

The decrease in income from operations was partially offset by the following:       ·   Growth in insurance premiums driven by normal, organic business growth in our non-medical products; and         ·    Higher net investment income driven by an increase in business and more favorable results from our investment income on alternative investments (see “Consolidated Investments – Alternative Investments” below for additional information).           87            As discussed above, during the first quarter of 2010, we experienced significantly unfavorable life loss ratios due primarily to adverse mortality experience, which we do not expect to recur in future quarters. In addition, we continued to experience favorable disability loss ratios due primarily to favorable claims incidence experience that we do not expect will be sustainable indefinitely. We attribute the favorable incidence experience in our long-term disability line of business to be related, at least in part, to the impact of the challenging economic environment on our insureds. We expect to experience non-medical loss ratios for the remainder of 2010 at the low end of our historical expected range of 71% to 74%. Management focuses on trends in loss ratios to compare actual experience with pricing expectations because group-underwriting risks change over time. We expect normal fluctuations in our composite non-medical loss ratios of this segment, as claim experience is inherently uncertain.   During the first quarter of 2009, we experienced exceptional short- and long-term disability loss ratios due primarily to favorable claims incidence and termination experience. In addition, we experienced significantly unfavorable life loss ratios in the first quarter of 2009 due primarily to adverse mortality experience, the downward effects of whole-case pricing on premium rates and a one-time adjustment to benefits of $3 million relating to unfavorable waiver claim reserves.   We allocated more overhead costs to this segment during the first quarter of 2010, and we expect this trend will continue in the remaining quarters of 2010, as the disposal of our Lincoln UK and Investment Management businesses resulted in a reallocation of overhead expenses to our remaining businesses. See “Acquisitions and Dispositions” in our 2009 Form 10-K for additional details. Additionally, we plan to make strategic investments during 2010 that will also result in higher expenses.   We experienced a favorable decline in expenses attributable to our U.S. pension plans during the first quarter of 2010 when compared to the corresponding period of 2009, and we expect this trend will continue in the remaining quarters of 2010. For additional information, see “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans” in our 2009 Form 10-K.   Sales relate to long-duration contracts sold to new contract holders and new programs sold to existing contract holders. We believe that the trend in sales is an important indicator of development of business in force over time.   We provide information about this segment’s operating revenue and operating expense line items, the period in which amounts are recognized, key drivers of changes and historical details underlying the line items and their associated drivers below.   Insurance Premiums   Details underlying insurance premiums (in millions) were as follows:           For the Three                Months Ended                March 31,                2010       2009       Change      Insurance Premiums by Product Line                      Life    $ 157     $ 142       11 %   Disability      178       174       2 %   Dental      40       38       5 %   Total non-medical      375       354       6 %   Medical      35       36       -3 %   Total insurance premiums    $ 410     $ 390       5 %   Sales    $ 63     $ 54       17 %     Our cost of insurance and policy administration charges are embedded in the premiums charged to our customers. The premiums are a function of the rates priced into the product and our business in force. Business in force, in turn, is driven by sales and persistency experience. Sales in the table above are the combined annualized premiums for our life, disability and dental products.          88           The business represented as “medical” consists primarily of our non-core EXEC-U-CARE® product. This product provides an insured medical expense reimbursement vehicle to executives for non-covered health plan costs. This product produces significant revenues and benefits expenses for this segment but only a limited amount of income. Discontinuance of this product would significantly impact segment revenues, but not income from operations.   Net Investment Income   We use our interest income to build the associated policy reserves, which are a function of our insurance premiums and the yields on our invested assets.   Benefits and Interest Credited   Details underlying benefits and interest credited (in millions) and loss ratios by product line were as follows:           For the Three                Months Ended                March 31,                2010       2009       Change      Benefits and Interest Credited by Product Line                      Life    $ 129     $ 116       11 %   Disability      117       103       14 %   Dental      34       32       6 %   Total non-medical      280       251       12 %   Medical      31       32       -3 %   Total benefits and interest credited    $ 311     $ 283       10 %                              Loss Ratios by Product Line                            Life      82.4 %     81.6 %           Disability      65.5 %     59.1 %           Dental      86.1 %     84.2 %           Total non-medical      74.8 %     70.8 %           Medical      87.8 %     88.9 %             Note: Loss ratios presented above are calculated using whole dollars instead of dollars rounded to millions.          89            Underwriting, Acquisition, Insurance and Other Expenses   Details underlying underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses (in millions) were as follows:           For the Three                Months Ended                March 31,                2010       2009       Change      Underwriting, Acquisition, Insurance                      and Other Expenses                      Commissions    $ 47     $ 44       7 %   General and administrative expenses      47       47       0 %   Taxes, licenses and fees      11       11       0 %   Total expenses incurred      105       102       3 %   DAC and VOBA deferrals      (15 )     (13 )     -15 %   Total expenses recognized before                            amortization      90       89       1 %   DAC and VOBA amortization, net of interest      11       10       10 %   Total underwriting, acquisition,                            insurance and other expenses    $ 101     $ 99       2 %                              DAC and VOBA Deferrals                            As a percentage of insurance premiums      3.7 %     3.3 %             Expenses, excluding broker commissions, that vary with and are related primarily to the production of new business are deferred to the extent recoverable and are amortized on either a straight-line basis or as a level percent of premium of the related contracts depending on the block of business. Broker commissions, which vary with and are related to paid premiums, are expensed as incurred. The level of expenses is an important driver of profitability for this segment as group insurance contracts are offered within an environment that competes on the basis of price and service.          90           RESULTS OF OTHER OPERATIONS   Other Operations includes investments related to the excess capital in our insurance subsidiaries; investments in media properties and other corporate investments; benefit plan net assets; the unamortized deferred gain on indemnity reinsurance related to the sale of reinsurance to Swiss Re in 2001; the results of certain disability income business due to the rescission of a reinsurance agreement with Swiss Re; the Institutional Pension business, which is a closed-block of pension business, the majority of which was sold on a group annuity basis, and is currently in run-off; and debt costs. We are actively managing our remaining radio station clusters to maximize performance and future value.

Risk Factors” in our 2009 Form 10-K and “Forward-Looking Statements – Cautionary Language” above.   Loss from Operations   Details underlying the results for Other Operations (in millions) were as follows:           For the Three                Months Ended                March 31,                2010       2009       Change      Operating Revenues                      Insurance premiums    $ -     $ 1       -100 %   Net investment income      85       70       21 %   Amortization of deferred gain on business                             sold through reinsurance      18       18       0 %   Media revenues (net)      16       15       7 %   Other revenues and fees      5       1      NM      Total operating revenues      124       105       18 %   Operating Expenses                            Interest credited      34       51       -33 %   Benefits      34       107       -68 %   Media expenses      14       13       8 %   Other expenses      29       36       -19 %   Interest and debt expense      68       65       5 %   Total operating expenses      179       272       -34 %   Loss from operations before taxes      (55 )     (167 )     67 %   Federal income tax benefit      (18 )     (58 )     69 %   Loss from operations    $ (37 )   $ (109 )     66 %     Comparison of the Three Months Ended March 31, 2010 to 2009   Loss from operations for this segment decreased due primarily to the following:       ·   The $64 million unfavorable impact in the first quarter of 2009 of the rescission of the reinsurance agreement on certain disability income business sold to Swiss Re, which resulted in pre-tax increases in benefits of $78 million, interest credited of $15 million and other expenses of $5 million, partially offset by a $34 million tax benefit;        ·   Higher net investment income related primarily to higher invested assets driven by distributable earnings received from our insurance segments, issuances of common stock and preferred stock and proceeds from the sale of Delaware; and        ·   Lower other expenses attributable primarily to restructuring charges for expense initiatives in the first quarter of 2009, higher merger-related expenses in the first quarter of 2009 and the Swiss Re-related increase discussed above, partially offset by the allocation of overhead costs during the first quarter of 2010, as discussed below in “Additional Information.”             91           Additional Information   We expect a lower loss from operations for Other Operations in 2010 than was experienced in 2009. The expected decrease is attributable primarily to the following:       ·   Lower expenses attributable to the completion of our expense reduction initiatives in 2009 (see “Results of Other Operations – Additional Information” in our 2009 Form 10-K for details), partially offset by expected increases in branding costs and investments in strategic initiatives and higher allocated overhead costs during 2010, as the disposal of our Lincoln UK and Investment Management businesses resulted in a reallocation of overhead expenses to our remaining businesses (see “Acquisitions and Dispositions” in our 2009 Form 10-K for additional details);        ·   Higher investment income from an increase in the distributable earnings that will be received from our insurance segments due to expected less challenging economic conditions; and        ·   The unfavorable impact of the rescission in 2009 of the reinsurance agreement with Swiss Re for disability income business that we do not expect to recur.      The inclusion of run-off disability income business results within Other Operations due to the rescission of the Swiss Re reinsurance agreement mentioned above may create volatility in earnings going forward.   We provide information about Other Operations’ operating revenue and operating expense line items, the period in which amounts are recognized, key drivers of changes and historical details underlying the line items and their associated drivers below.   Net Investment Income and Interest Credited   We utilize an internal formula to determine the amount of capital that is allocated to our business segments. Investment income on capital in excess of the calculated amounts is reported in Other Operations. If regulations require increases in our insurance segments’ statutory reserves and surplus, the amount of capital retained by Other Operations would decrease and net investment income would be negatively impacted. In addition, as discussed below in “Review of Consolidated Financial Condition – Alternative Sources of Liquidity,” we maintain an inter-segment cash management program where certain subsidiaries can borrow from or lend money to the holding company to meet short-term borrowing needs. The inter-segment cash management program affects net investment income for Other Operations, as all inter-segment eliminations are reported within Other Operations.   Write-downs for OTTI decrease the recorded value of our invested assets owned by our business segments. These write-downs are not included in the income from operations of our operating segments. When impairment occurs, assets are transferred to the business segments’ portfolios and will reduce the future net investment income for Other Operations, but should not have an impact on a consolidated basis unless the impairments are related to defaulted securities. Statutory reserve adjustments for our business segments can also cause allocations of invested assets between the affected segments and Other Operations.   The majority of our interest credited relates to our reinsurance operations sold to Swiss Re in 2001. A substantial amount of the business was sold through indemnity reinsurance transactions resulting in some of the business still flowing through our consolidated financial statements. The interest credited corresponds to investment income earnings on the assets we continue to hold for this business. There is no impact to income or loss in Other Operations or on a consolidated basis for these amounts because interest earned on the blocks that continue to be reinsured is passed through to Swiss Re in the form of interest credited.   Benefits   Benefits are recognized when incurred for Institutional Pension products and disability income business.          92           Other Expenses   Details underlying other expenses (in millions) were as follows:           For the Three                Months Ended                March 31,                2010       2009       Change      Other Expenses                      Merger-related expenses    $ 2     $ 7       -71 %   Restructuring charges for expense initiatives      -       5       -100 %   Branding      4       5       -20 %   Retirement Income Security Ventures      2       2       0 %   Taxes, licenses and fees      1       2       -50 %   Other      20       15       33 %   Total other expenses    $ 29     $ 36       -19 %     Other in the table above includes expenses that are corporate in nature including charitable contributions, certain litigation reserves, amortization of media intangible assets with a definite life, other expenses not allocated to our business segments and inter-segment expense eliminations.   Merger-related expenses were the result of actions undertaken by us to eliminate duplicate operations and functions as a result of the Jefferson-Pilot merger along with costs related to the implementation of our new unified product portfolio and other initiatives. These actions were substantially completed during 2009, as we only expect to incur $9 million, pre-tax, during 2010. As of December 31, 2009, our cumulative integration expense was approximately $225 million, pre-tax, which excluded amounts capitalized or recorded as goodwill.   Starting in December 2008, we implemented a restructuring plan in response to the economic downturn and sustained market volatility, which focused on reducing expenses. The expenses associated with this initiative are reported in restructuring charges for expense initiatives above. These actions were completed during 2009. Our cumulative pre-tax charges amounted to $42 million for severance, benefits and related costs associated with the plan for workforce reduction and other restructuring actions.   Interest and Debt Expense   Our current level of interest expense may not be indicative of the future due to, among other things, the timing of the use of cash, the availability of funds from our inter-company cash management program and the future cost of capital.

For factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in this section, see “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2009 Form 10-K and “Forward-Looking Statements – Cautionary Language” above.   For information on our counterparty exposure see “Part I – Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.”   Comparison of the Three Months Ended March 31, 2010 to 2009   Our realized loss for the first quarter of 2010 decreased significantly as compared to our experience throughout 2009 due primarily to the decline in OTTI attributable primarily to general improvement in the credit markets and more favorable hedge program performance.    Our GLB net derivatives results and GDB derivatives results during the first quarter of 2010 were close to zero as compared to unfavorable during the first quarter of 2009. The unfavorable GLB net derivatives results during the first quarter of 2009 were attributable primarily to increases in interest rates and our over-hedged position for a period of time in 2009. The unfavorable decline in GDB derivatives results was attributable primarily to favorable equity markets in the first quarter of 2010 as compared to unfavorable in the first quarter of 2009.   For more information on realized losses on certain investments, see “Consolidated Investments – Realized Loss Related to Investments” below.   The gain on certain reinsurance derivative/trading securities during the first quarter of 2009 was due primarily to the rescission of the Swiss Re indemnity reinsurance agreement covering certain disability income business, whereby we released the embedded derivative liability related to the funds withheld nature of the reinsurance agreement. Prior to the rescission of the Swiss Re indemnity reinsurance agreement, the fluctuations in the fair value of the trading securities mostly offset the fair value fluctuations in the embedded derivative of the reinsurance agreement with the net difference reported as a realized gain or loss. The release of this embedded derivative liability increased net income by approximately $31 million in the first quarter of 2009. Since the rescission, this line item is impacted by market conditions as we now have trading securities that are no longer supporting an embedded derivative liability due to the rescission causing us to release that liability. Consequently, we may experience more volatility in the fluctuation of this component of realized gain or loss in the future.

Operating realized gain includes the following:   Indexed Annuity Net Derivative Results   Indexed annuity net derivatives results represent the net difference between the change in the fair value of the S&P 500 call options that we hold and the change in the fair value of the embedded derivative liabilities of our indexed annuity products. The change in the fair value of the liability for the embedded derivative represents the amount that is credited to the indexed annuity contract.   GLB   Our GWB, GIB and 4LATER® features have elements of both benefit reserves and embedded derivative reserves. We calculate the value of the embedded derivative reserve and the benefit reserve based on the specific characteristics of each GLB feature. For our GLBs that meet the definition of an embedded derivative under the Derivatives and Hedging Topic of the FASB ASC, we record them at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in realized loss on our Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss). In bifurcating the embedded derivative, we attribute to the embedded derivative the portion of total fees collected from the contract holder that relates to the GLB riders (the “attributed fees”). These attributed fees represent the present value of future claims expected to be paid for the GLB at the inception of the contract (the “net valuation premium”) plus a margin that a theoretical market participant would include for risk/profit (the “risk/profit margin”).          95           The NPR factors affect the discount rate used in the calculation of the GLB embedded derivative reserve. Our methodology for calculating the NPR component of the embedded derivative reserve utilizes an extrapolated 30-year NPR spread curve applied to a series of expected cash flows over the expected life of the embedded derivative. Our cash flows consist of both expected fees to be received from contract holders and benefits to be paid, and these cash flows are different on a pre- and post- NPR basis. The difference in the cash flows for the year ended March 31, 2010, resulted in an increase to the GLB reserve liability in excess of the liability that we hedge. We utilize a model based on our holding company’s credit default swap (“CDS”) spreads adjusted for items, such as the liquidity of our holding company CDS. Because the guaranteed benefit liabilities are contained within our insurance subsidiaries, we apply items, such as the impact of our insurance subsidiaries’ claims-paying ratings compared to holding company credit risk and the over-collateralization of insurance liabilities, in order to determine factors that are representative of a theoretical market participant’s view of the NPR of the specific liability within our insurance subsidiaries. Details underlying the NPR component and associated impact to our GLB embedded derivative reserves (dollars in millions) were as follows:           As of       As of       As of       As of       As of          March 31,       December 31,       September 30,       June 30,       March 31,          2010       2009       2009       2009       2009 (1)      10-year CDS spread      1.64 %     1.68 %     2.49 %     5.52 %     23.25 %   NPR factor related                                            to 10-year CDS spread      0.11 %     0.08 %     0.20 %     0.82 %     1.49 %   Unadjusted embedded                                            derivative liability    $ 461     $ 643     $ 1,014     $ 1,197     $ 3,064           (1)   We experienced significant widening of our CDS spreads during the first quarter of 2009. We compared our CDS spreads to those of our peer companies with similar holding company ratings and determined that our company specific spreads were significantly wider due to the market’s concerns over our holding company liquidity. As a result, we reduced the spreads used in the calculation of our NPR factors to be in line with our peers. Therefore, the starting point for our spreads was reduced over the entire term structure with the 10-year at 8.45%.      Estimating what the absolute amount of the NPR effect will be period to period is difficult due to the utilization of all cash flows and the shape of the spread curve. Currently, we estimate that if the NPR factors as of March 31, 2010, were to have been zero along all points on the spread curve, then the NPR offset to the unadjusted liability would have resulted in an unfavorable impact to net income of approximately $30 million, pre-DAC* and tax. Alternatively, if the NPR factors were 20 basis points higher along all points on the spread curve as of March 31, 2010, then there would have been a favorable impact to net income of approximately $50 million, pre-DAC* and tax. Changing market conditions could cause this relationship to deviate significantly in future periods. Sensitivity within this range is primarily a result of volatility in our CDS spreads and the slope of the CDS spread term structure.       *   DAC refers to the associated amortization of DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL.      We include the risk/profit margin portion of the GLB attributed rider fees in operating realized gain and include the net valuation premium of the GLB attributed rider fees in excluded realized loss. For our Retirement Solutions – Annuities and Retirement Solutions – Defined Contribution segments, the excess of total fees collected from the contract holders over the GLB attributed rider fees is reported in insurance fees.   Realized Loss Related to Certain Investments   See “Consolidated Investments – Realized Loss Related to Investments” below.   Gain on Certain Reinsurance Derivative/Trading Securities   Gain on certain reinsurance derivative/trading securities represents changes in the fair values of total return swaps (embedded derivatives) theoretically included in our various modified coinsurance and coinsurance with funds withheld reinsurance arrangements that have contractual returns related to various assets and liabilities associated with these arrangements and changes in the fair value of trading securities, which in certain cases support these arrangements.          96           GLB Net Derivatives Results and GDB Derivatives Results   Details underlying GLB net derivatives results and GDB derivative results (in millions) were as follows:           For the Three                Months Ended                March 31,                2010       2009       Change      GLB Net Derivatives Results                      Net valuation premium, net of reinsurance    $ 26     $ 22       18 %   Change in reserves hedged      190       233       -18 %   Change in market value of derivative assets      (198 )     (298 )     34 %   Hedge program ineffectiveness      (8 )     (65 )     88 %   Change in reserves not hedged (NPR                            component)      (1 )     (55 )     98 %   Change in derivative assets not hedged (NPR                            component)      (1 )     (12 )     92 %   Associated amortization expense of DAC,                            VOBA, DSI and DFEL:                            Retrospective unlocking (1)      5       (59 )     108 %   Amortization, excluding unlocking      (9 )     43      NM      Total GLB net derivatives results    $ 12     $ (126 )     110 %                              GDB Derivatives Results                            Change in fair value of derivatives    $ (15 )   $ 57      NM      Associated amortization expense of DAC,                            VOBA, DSI and DFEL:                            Retrospective unlocking (1)      (7 )     27      NM      Amortization, excluding unlocking      9       (39 )     123 %   Total GDB derivatives results    $ (13 )   $ 45      NM            (1)   Related primarily to the emergence of gross profits.      GLB Net Derivatives Results   Our GLB net derivatives results are comprised of the net valuation premium, the change in the GLB embedded derivative reserves and the change in the fair value of the derivative instruments we own to hedge them, including the cost of purchasing the hedging instruments.   Our GWB, GIB and 4LATER® features have elements of both benefit reserves and embedded derivative reserves. We calculate the value of the embedded derivative reserve and the benefit reserve based on the specific characteristics of each GLB feature. We record the embedded derivative reserve on our GLBs at fair value on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We use derivative instruments to hedge our exposure to the risks and earnings volatility that result from changes in the GLB embedded derivatives reserves. The change in fair value of these derivative instruments is designed to generally offset the change in embedded derivative reserves. In the table above, we have presented the components of our GLB results, which can be volatile especially when sudden and significant changes in equity markets and/or interest rates occur. When we assess the effectiveness of our hedge program, we exclude the impact of the change in the component of the embedded derivative reserves related to the required NPR. We do not attempt to hedge the change in the NPR component of the liability. As of March 31, 2010, the net effect of the NPR resulted in a $34 million increase in the liability for our GLB embedded derivative reserves. See above for information regarding the effect of the NPR on the GLB net derivatives results for the three months ended March 31, 2010 and 2009. For additional information on our guaranteed benefits, see “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Derivatives – Guaranteed Living Benefits” above.          97           GDB Derivatives Results   Our GDB derivatives results represent the change in the fair value of the derivative instruments we own to hedge the change in our benefit ratio unlocking, excluding our expected cost of the hedging instruments.   Indexed Annuity Forward-Starting Option   Details underlying indexed annuity forward-starting option (in millions) were as follows:           For the Three                Months Ended                March 31,                2010       2009       Change      Indexed Annuity Forward-Starting Option                      Pre-DAC (1) amounts    $ 4     $ 1       300 %   Associated amortization expense of DAC,                            VOBA, DSI and DFEL      (2 )     -      NM      Total    $ 2     $ 1       100 %         (1)   DAC refers to the associated amortization of DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL.      The liability for the forward-starting option reflects changes in the fair value of embedded derivative liabilities related to index call options we may purchase in the future to hedge contract holder index allocations applicable to future reset periods for our indexed annuity products accounted for under the Derivatives and Hedging and the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topics of the FASB ASC. These fair values represent an estimate of the cost of the options we will purchase in the future, discounted back to the date of the balance sheet, using current market indications of volatility and interest rates, which can vary significantly from period to period due to a number of factors and therefore can provide results that are not indicative of the underlying trends.        98           CONSOLIDATED INVESTMENTS   Details underlying our consolidated investment balances (in millions) were as follows:                 Percentage of                      Total Investments          As of       As of       As of       As of          March 31,       December 31,       March 31,       December 31,          2010       2009       2010       2009      Investments                            AFS securities:                            Fixed maturity    $ 62,881     $ 60,818       80.2 %     80.1 %   VIEs' fixed maturity      579       -       0.7 %     0.0 %    Total fixed maturity      63,460       60,818       80.9 %     80.1 %   Equity      310       278       0.4 %     0.4 %   Trading securities      2,532       2,505       3.2 %     3.3 %   Mortgage loans on real estate      7,013       7,178       8.9 %     9.5 %   Real estate      201       174       0.3 %     0.2 %   Policy loans      2,903       2,898       3.7 %     3.8 %   Derivative investments      992       1,010       1.3 %     1.3 %   Alternative investments      696       696       0.9 %     0.9 %   Other investments      351       361       0.4 %     0.5 %   Total investments    $ 78,458     $ 75,918       100.0 %     100.0 %     Investment Objective   Invested assets are an integral part of our operations. We follow a balanced approach to investing for both current income and prudent risk management, with an emphasis on generating sufficient current income, net of income tax, to meet our obligations to customers, as well as other general liabilities. This balanced approach requires the evaluation of expected return and risk of each asset class utilized, while still meeting our income objectives. This approach is important to our asset-liability management because decisions can be made based upon both the economic and current investment income considerations affecting assets and liabilities. For a discussion on our risk management process, see “Part II – Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” in our 2009 Form 10-K.   Investment Portfolio Composition and Diversification   Fundamental to our investment policy is diversification across asset classes. Our investment portfolio, excluding cash and invested cash, is composed of fixed maturity securities, mortgage loans on real estate, real estate (either wholly-owned or in joint ventures) and other long-term investments. We purchase investments for our segmented portfolios that have yield, duration and other characteristics that take into account the liabilities of the products being supported.   We have the ability to maintain our investment holdings throughout credit cycles because of our capital position, the long-term nature of our liabilities and the matching of our portfolios of investment assets with the liabilities of our various products.   Fixed Maturity and Equity Securities Portfolios   Fixed maturity securities and equity securities consist of portfolios classified as AFS and trading. Mortgage-backed and private securities are included in both AFS and trading portfolios.   Details underlying our fixed maturity and equity securities portfolios by industry classification (in millions) are presented in the tables below. These tables agree in total with the presentation of AFS securities in Note 5; however, the categories below represent a more detailed breakout of the AFS portfolio; therefore, the investment classifications listed below do not agree to the investment categories provided in Note 5.        99                       As of March 31, 2010                      Unrealized                      Amortized       Unrealized       Losses       Fair       % Fair          Cost       Gains       and OTTI       Value       Value      Fixed Maturity AFS Securities                                  Industry corporate bonds:                                  Financial services    $ 8,471     $ 334     $ 201     $ 8,604       13.6 %   Basic industry      2,291       141       43       2,389       3.8 %   Capital goods      3,172       173       32       3,313       5.2 %   Communications      2,701       204       40       2,865       4.5 %   Consumer cyclical      2,533       152       56       2,629       4.1 %   Consumer non-cyclical      6,137       411       16       6,532       10.3 %   Energy      4,327       331       12       4,646       7.3 %   Technology      1,192       83       3       1,272       2.0 %   Transportation      1,183       77       9       1,251       2.0 %   Industrial other      697       44       7       734       1.2 %   Utilities      9,221       494       54       9,661       15.2 %   Corporate asset-backed securities ("ABS"):                                            Collateralized debt obligations ("CDOs")      130       14       14       130       0.2 %   Commercial real estate ("CRE") CDOs      53       -

Refer to the “Trading Securities” section of our 2009 Form 10-K for further details.           101           AFS Securities   The general intent of the AFS accounting guidance is to reflect stockholders’ equity as if unrealized gains and losses were actually recognized, and it is necessary that we consider all related accounting adjustments that would occur upon such a hypothetical recognition of unrealized gains and losses. Such related balance sheet effects include adjustments to the balances of DAC, VOBA, DFEL, other contract holder funds and deferred income taxes. Adjustments to each of these balances are charged or credited to accumulated OCI. For instance, DAC is adjusted upon the recognition of unrealized gains or losses because the amortization of DAC is based upon an assumed emergence of gross profits on certain insurance business. Deferred income tax balances are also adjusted because unrealized gains or losses do not affect actual taxes currently paid.   The quality of our AFS fixed maturity securities portfolio, as measured at estimated fair value and by the percentage of fixed maturity securities invested in various ratings categories, relative to the entire fixed maturity AFS security portfolio (in millions) was as follows:             Rating Agency       As of March 31, 2010       As of December 31, 2009      NAIC       Equivalent       Amortized       Fair       % of       Amortized       Fair       % of      Designation       Designation       Cost       Value       Total       Cost       Value       Total      Investment Grade Securities                                           1      Aaa / Aa / A      $ 37,473     $ 38,787       61.1 %   $ 35,041     $ 35,924       59.0 %    2      Baa        20,117       20,951       33.0 %     20,294       20,725       34.1 %   Total investment grade securities        57,590       59,738       94.1 %     55,335       56,649       93.1 %   Below Investment Grade Securities                                                       3      Ba        3,059       2,632       4.2 %     3,221       2,695       4.5 %    4     B       922       662       1.0 %     1,470       948       1.6 %    5      Caa and lower        327       196       0.3 %     426       265       0.4 %    6      In or near default        258       232       0.4 %     305       261       0.4 %   Total below investment grade securities        4,566       3,722       5.9 %     5,422       4,169       6.9 %   Total fixed maturity AFS securities      $ 62,156     $ 63,460       100.0 %   $ 60,757     $ 60,818       100.0 %                                                                  Total securities below investment grade                                                      as a percentage of total fixed                                                      maturity AFS securities        7.3 %     5.9 %             8.9 %     6.9 %             Comparisons between the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”) ratings and rating agency designations are published by the NAIC. The NAIC assigns securities quality ratings and uniform valuations, which are used by insurers when preparing their annual statements. The NAIC ratings are similar to the rating agency designations of the Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations for marketable bonds. NAIC ratings 1 and 2 include bonds generally considered investment grade (rated Baa3 or higher by Moody’s Investors Service (“Moody’s”), or rated BBB- or higher by S&P and Fitch Ratings (“Fitch”)), by such ratings organizations. However, securities rated NAIC 1 and NAIC 2 could be below investment grade by the rating agencies, which is a result of the changes in the RBC rules for residential mortgage-backed securities (“RMBS”) that were effective December 31, 2009, for statutory reporting. NAIC ratings 3 through 6 include bonds generally considered below investment grade (rated Ba1 or lower by Moody’s, or rated BB+ or lower by S&P and Fitch).          102           Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain are experiencing stressed capital and credit markets. As of March 31, 2010, the carrying value of our direct investments in the sovereign debt and banks of the countries noted above (in millions) were as follows:           Sovereign                Debt       Bank (1)      Country                Ireland    $ -     $ 11     Italy      3       6     Spain      -       19     Total    $ 3     $ 36           (1)   We have identified indirect exposure to two highly rated multi-national Spanish banks in our investments in CLN structures. We do not view this exposure as material to our financial condition.      As of March 31, 2010, and December 31, 2009, 80.9% and 80.3%, respectively, of the total publicly traded and private securities in an unrealized loss status were rated as investment grade. See Note 5 for maturity date information for our fixed maturity investment portfolio. Our gross unrealized losses on AFS securities decreased $831 million in the three months ended March 31, 2010, which was attributable primarily to increased liquidity in several market segments and improved credit fundamentals. As more fully described in Note 1 in our 2009 Form 10-K, we regularly review our investment holdings for OTTI. We believe the unrealized loss position as of March 31, 2010, does not represent OTTI as we do not intend to sell these debt securities, it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the debt securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis, the estimated future cash flows are equal to or greater than the amortized cost basis of the debt securities, or we have the ability and intent to hold the equity securities for a period of time sufficient for recovery. For further information on our AFS securities unrealized losses, see “Additional Details on our Unrealized Losses on AFS Securities” below.   Selected information for certain AFS securities in a gross unrealized loss position (dollars in millions) was as follows:           As of March 31, 2010                  Estimated     Estimated                            Gross     Years     Average                            Unrealized     until Call     Years                      Fair       Losses and     or     until       Subordination Level          Value       OTTI     Maturity     Recovery       Current       Origination      CMBS    $ 574     $ 318    1 to 43      29       22.1 %     18.8 %   Hybrid and redeemable                                              preferred securities      853       172    1 to 57      34      NA       NA        As provided in the table above, many of the securities in these categories are long-dated with some of the preferred securities being perpetual. This is purposeful as it matches the long-term nature of our liabilities associated with our life insurance and annuity products. See “Part II – Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” in our 2009 Form 10-K where we present information related to maturities of securities and the expected cash flows for rate sensitive liabilities and maturities of our holding company debt, which also demonstrates the long-term nature of the cash flows associated with these items. Because of this relationship, we do not believe it will be necessary to sell these securities before they recover or mature. For these securities, the estimated range and average period until recovery is the call or maturity period. It is difficult to predict or project when the securities will recover as it is dependent upon a number of factors including the overall economic climate. We do not believe it is necessary to impair these securities as long as the expected future cash flows are projected to be sufficient to recover the amortized cost of these securities.   The actual range and period until recovery could vary significantly depending on a variety of factors, many of which are out of our control. There are several items that could affect the length of the period until recovery, such as the pace of economic recovery, level of delinquencies, performance of the underlying collateral, changes in market interest rates, exposures to various industry or geographic conditions, market behavior and other market conditions.          103           We concluded that it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the fixed maturity AFS securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis, that the estimated future cash flows are equal to or greater than the amortized cost basis of the debt securities, and that we have the ability to hold the equity AFS securities for a period of time sufficient for recovery. This conclusion is consistent with our asset-liability management process. Management considers the following as part of the evaluation:       ·   The current economic environment and market conditions;        ·   Our business strategy and current business plans;        ·   The nature and type of security, including expected maturities and exposure to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risk;        ·   Our analysis of data from financial models and other internal and industry sources to evaluate the current effectiveness of our hedging and overall risk management strategies;        ·   The current and expected timing of contractual maturities of our assets and liabilities, expectations of prepayments on investments and expectations for surrenders and withdrawals of life insurance policies and annuity contracts;        ·   The capital risk limits approved by management; and        ·   Our current financial condition and liquidity demands.      To determine the recoverability of a debt security, we consider the facts and circumstances surrounding the underlying issuer including, but not limited to, the following:       ·   Historic and implied volatility of the security;        ·   Length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than amortized cost;        ·   Adverse conditions specifically related to the security or to specific conditions in an industry or geographic area;        ·   Failure, if any, of the issuer of the security to make scheduled payments; and        ·   Recoveries or additional declines in fair value subsequent to the balance sheet date.      As reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, we had $81.9 billion of investments and cash, which exceeded the liabilities for our future obligations under insurance policies and contracts, net of amounts recoverable from reinsurers, which totaled $74.2 billion as of March 31, 2010. If it were necessary to liquidate securities prior to maturity or call to meet cash flow needs, we would first look to those securities that are in an unrealized gain position, which had a fair value of $48.9 billion excluding consolidated VIEs which amounted to $579 million, as of March 31, 2010, rather than selling securities in an unrealized loss position. The amount of cash that we have on hand at any point of time takes into account our liquidity needs in the future, other sources of cash, such as the maturities of investments, interest and dividends we earn on our investments and the on-going cash flows from new and existing business.   See “AFS Securities – Evaluation for Recovery of Amortized Cost” in Note 1 in our 2009 Form 10-K and Note 5 for additional discussion.   The estimated fair value for all private securities was $8.2 billion and $8.0 billion as of March 31, 2010, and December 31, 2009, respectively, representing approximately 10% and 11% of total invested assets as of March 31, 2010, and December 31, 2009, respectively.   For information regarding our VIEs’ fixed maturity securities, see Note 4. For discussion of our investments in CLNs as of December 31, 2009, see our 2009 Form 10-K CLNs section in Note 5.   Mortgage-Backed Securities (“MBS”) (Included in AFS and Trading Securities)   Our fixed maturity securities include MBS. These securities are subject to risks associated with variable prepayments. This may result in differences between the actual cash flow and maturity of these securities than that expected at the time of purchase. Securities that have an amortized cost greater than par and are backed by mortgages that prepay faster than expected will incur a reduction in yield or a loss. Those securities with an amortized cost lower than par that prepay faster than expected will generate an increase in yield or a gain. In addition, we may incur reinvestment risks if market yields are lower than the book yields earned on the securities. Prepayments occurring slower than expected have the opposite impact. We may incur reinvestment risks if market yields are higher than the book yields earned on the securities and we are forced to sell the securities. The degree to which a security is susceptible to either gains or losses is influenced by: the difference between its amortized cost and par; the relative sensitivity of the underlying mortgages backing the assets to prepayment in a changing interest rate environment; and the repayment priority of the securities in the overall securitization structure.        104             We limit the extent of our risk on MBS by prudently limiting exposure to the asset class, by generally avoiding the purchase of securities with a cost that significantly exceeds par, by purchasing securities backed by stable collateral and by concentrating on securities with enhanced priority in their trust structure. Such securities with reduced risk typically have a lower yield (but higher liquidity) than higher-risk MBS. At selected times, higher-risk securities may be purchased if they do not compromise the safety of the general portfolio. As of March 31, 2010, we did not have a significant amount of higher-risk, trust structured MBS. A significant amount of assets in our MBS portfolio are either guaranteed by U.S. government-sponsored enterprises or are supported in the securitization structure by junior securities enabling the assets to achieve high investment grade status.   Our exposure to subprime mortgage lending is limited to investments in banks and other financial institutions that may be impacted by subprime lending and direct investments in ABS CDOs, ABS and RMBS. Mortgage-related ABS are backed by home equity loans and RMBS are backed by residential mortgages. These securities are backed by loans that are characterized by borrowers of differing levels of creditworthiness: prime; Alt-A; and subprime. Prime lending is the origination of residential mortgage loans to customers with excellent credit profiles. Alt-A lending is the origination of residential mortgage loans to customers who have prime credit profiles but lack documentation to substantiate income. Subprime lending is the origination of loans to customers with weak or impaired credit profiles.   The slowing U.S. housing market, increased interest rates for non-prime borrowers and relaxed underwriting standards over the last several years have led to higher delinquency rates for residential mortgage loans and home equity loans. We expect delinquency rates and loss rates on residential mortgages and home equity loans to increase in the future; however, we continue to expect to receive payments in accordance with contractual terms for a significant amount of our securities, largely due to the seniority of the claims on the collateral of the securities that we own. The tranches of the securities will experience losses according to their seniority level with the least senior (or most junior), typically the unrated residual tranche, taking the initial loss. The credit ratings of our securities reflect the seniority of the securities that we own. Our RMBS had a market value of $10.2 billion and an unrealized loss of $427 million, or 4%, as of March 31, 2010. The unrealized loss was due primarily to continued deteriorating housing fundamentals and although liquidity has improved in recent quarters, a general level of illiquidity still exists in the market resulting in price declines in many structured products.          105           The market value of AFS securities and trading securities backed by subprime loans was $456 million and represented less than 1% of our total investment portfolio as of March 31, 2010. AFS securities represented $443 million, or 97%, and trading securities represented $13 million, or 3%, of the subprime exposure as of March 31, 2010. AFS securities and trading securities rated A or above represented 62% of the subprime investments and $224 million in market value of our subprime investments was backed by loans originating in 2005 and forward.

Monoline insurers guarantee the timely repayment of bond principal and interest when a bond issuer defaults and generally provide credit enhancement for bond issues such as municipal bonds and private placements as well as other types and structures of securities. Our direct exposure represents our bond holdings of the actual Monoline insurers. Our insured bonds represent our holdings in bonds of other issuers that are insured by Monoline insurers.   The following summarizes our exposure to Monoline insurers (in millions):           As of March 31, 2010                                  Total                            Total       Total       Unrealized       Total          Direct       Insured       Amortized       Unrealized       Loss       Fair          Exposure (1)       Bonds (2)       Cost       Gain       and OTTI       Value      Monoline Name                                        AMBAC    $ -     $ 250     $ 250     $ 2     $ 66     $ 186     ASSURED GUARANTY LTD      30       -       30       -       10       20     FGIC      -       87       87       -       29       58     FSA      -       60       60       -       3       57     MBIA      12       150       162       11       19       154     MGIC      11       6       17       -       2       15     PMI GROUP INC      27       -       27       -       14       13     RADIAN GROUP INC      19       -       19       -       4       15     XL CAPITAL LTD      72       63       135       3       14       124     Total by Monoline insurer (3)    $ 171     $ 616     $ 787     $ 16     $ 161     $ 642                                                        Total AFS securities                    $ 62,533     $ 3,201     $ 1,964     $ 63,770     Total by Monoline insurer as a                                                    percentage of total AFS securities                      1.3 %     0.5 %     8.2 %     1.0 %         (1)   Additional direct exposure through credit default swaps with a notional value totaling $84 million is excluded from this table.        (2)   Additional indirect insured exposure through structured securities is excluded from this table.        (3)   Does not include the fair value of trading securities totaling $30 million, which support our Modco reinsurance agreements because investment results for these agreements are passed directly to the reinsurers. The $30 million in trading securities consisted of $10 million of direct exposure and $20 million of insured exposure. This table also excludes insured exposure totaling $12 million for a guaranteed investment tax credit partnership.      Additional Details on our Unrealized Losses on AFS Securities   When considering unrealized gain and loss information, it is important to recognize that the information relates to the status of securities at a particular point in time and may not be indicative of the status of our investment portfolios subsequent to the balance sheet date. Further, because the timing of the recognition of realized investment gains and losses through the selection of which securities are sold is largely at management’s discretion, it is important to consider the information provided below within the context of the overall unrealized gain or loss position of our investment portfolios. These are important considerations that should be included in any evaluation of the potential impact of unrealized loss securities on our future earnings.        110           We have no concentrations of issuers or guarantors of fixed maturity and equity securities. The composition by industry categories of securities subject to enhanced analysis and monitoring for potential changes in unrealized loss status (in millions) for our securities that we believe were most at risk of impairment, was as follows:           As of March 31, 2010                                        %                %             %       Unrealized       Unrealized          Fair       Fair       Amortized       Amortized       Loss       Loss          Value       Value       Cost       Cost       and OTTI       and OTTI      CMOs    $ 59       22.8 %   $ 99       24.5 %   $ 40       26.9 %   Banking      84       32.5 %     123       30.4 %     39       26.4 %   CMBS      4       1.6 %     28       6.9 %     24       16.2 %   Property and casualty insurers      47       18.1 %     70       17.3 %     23       15.5 %   ABS      22       8.5 %     39       9.6 %     17       11.5 %   Non-agency      1       0.4 %     3       0.7 %     2       1.4 %   Industrial - other      4       1.6 %     6       1.5 %     2       1.4 %   Gaming      14       5.4 %     15       3.7 %     1       0.7 %   Financial - other      11       4.3 %     11       2.7 %     -       0.0 %   Electric      3       1.2 %     3       0.7 %     -       0.0 %   Retailers      1       0.4 %     1       0.2 %     -       0.0 %   Real estate investment trusts      1       0.4 %     1       0.2 %     -       0.0 %   Refining      3       1.2 %     3       0.7 %     -       0.0 %   Entertainment      2       0.8 %     2       0.5 %     -       0.0 %   Building materials      1       0.4 %     1       0.2 %     -       0.0 %   Metals and mining      1       0.4 %     1       0.2 %     -       0.0 %   Total securities subject to                                                    enhanced analysis                                                    and monitoring    $ 258       100.0 %   $ 406       100.0 %   $ 148       100.0 %   Total AFS securities    $ 63,770             $ 62,533             $ 1,964             Total securities subject to enhanced analysis and                                                     monitoring as a percentage of total AFS securities       0.4 %             0.6 %             7.5 %             In addition, as discussed in Note 1 in our 2009 Form 10-K, we perform detailed analysis of our AFS securities, including those presented above as well as other AFS securities.

These conditions and the overall economic downturn put pressure on the fundamentals of mortgage loans through rising vacancies, falling rents and falling property values.          118           Loan-to-value and debt-service coverage ratios are measures commonly used to assess the quality of mortgage loans. The loan-to-value ratio compares the principal amount of the loan to the fair value at origination of the underlying property collateralizing the loan, and is commonly expressed as a percentage. Loan-to-value ratios greater than 100% indicate that the principal amount is greater than the collateral value. Therefore, all else being equal, a smaller loan-to-value ratio generally indicates a higher quality loan. The debt-service coverage ratio compares a property’s net operating income to its debt-service payments. Debt-service coverage ratios of less than 1.0 indicate that property operations do not generate enough income to cover its current debt payments. Therefore, all else being equal, a larger debt-service coverage ratio generally indicates a higher quality loan. The following summarizes our loan-to-value and debt-service coverage ratios (in millions):           As of March 31, 2010      Loan-to-Value     Principal Amount       %       Debt-Service Coverage      Less than 65%    $ 4,832       69.0 %     1.67     65% to 75%      1,841       26.3 %     1.41     Greater than 75%      333       4.7 %     0.78     Total mortgage loans    $ 7,006       100.0 %             All mortgage loans that are impaired have an established allowance for credit loss. Changing economic conditions impact our valuation of mortgage loans. Changing vacancies and rents are incorporated into the discounted cash flow analysis that we perform for monitored loans and may contribute to the establishment of (or an increase or decrease in) an allowance for credit losses. In addition, we continue to monitor the entire commercial mortgage loan portfolio to identify risk. Areas of emphasis are properties that have deteriorating credits or have experienced debt coverage reduction. Where warranted, we have established or increased loss reserves based upon this analysis. There were eight impaired mortgage loans as of March 31, 2010, or less than 1% of the total dollar amount of mortgage loans. The carrying value on the mortgage loans that were two or more payments delinquent as of March 31, 2010, was $46 million, or 1% of total mortgage loans. The total principal and interest past due on the mortgage loans that were two or more payments delinquent as of March 31, 2010, was $2 million. The carrying value on the mortgage loans that were two or more payments delinquent as of December 31, 2009, was $36 million, or less than 1% of total mortgage loans. The total principal and interest past due on the mortgage loans that were two or more payments delinquent as of December 31, 2009, was $2 million. See Note 1 in our 2009 Form 10-K for more information regarding our accounting policy relating to the impairment of mortgage loans.          119           Alternative Investments   The carrying value of our consolidated alternative investments by business segment (in millions), which consisted primarily of investments in limited partnerships, was as follows:           As of       As of          March 31,       December 31,          2010       2009      Retirement Solutions:                Annuities    $ 85     $ 85     Defined Contribution      66       65     Insurance Solutions:                    Life Insurance      496       485     Group Protection      32       32     Other Operations      17       29     Total alternative investments    $ 696     $ 696       Income (loss) derived from our consolidated alternative investments by business segment (in millions) was as follows:           For the Three                Months Ended                March 31,                2010       2009       Change      Retirement Solutions:                      Annuities    $ 2     $ (1 )     300 %   Defined Contribution      2       -      NM      Insurance Solutions:                            Life Insurance      15       (5 )    NM      Group Protection      1       -      NM      Other Operations      1       -      NM      Total alternative investments (1)    $ 21     $ (6 )    NM            (1)   Includes net investment income on the alternative investments supporting the required statutory surplus of our insurance businesses.      The increase in our investment income on alternative investments presented in the table above when comparing the first three months of 2010 to the same period in 2009 was due to overall improvement in the equity markets specifically benefiting our hedge fund, venture capital and energy limited partnership holdings.   As of March 31, 2010, and December 31, 2009, alternative investments included investments in approximately 98 and 99 different partnerships, respectively, and the portfolio represented less than 1% of our overall invested assets. The partnerships do not represent off-balance sheet financing and generally involve several third-party partners. Some of our partnerships contain capital calls, which require us to contribute capital upon notification by the general partner. These capital calls are contemplated during the initial investment decision and are planned for well in advance of the call date. The capital calls are not material in size and are not material to our liquidity. Alternative investments are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and are included in other investments on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.   As discussed in “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Investments – Valuation of Alternative Investments,” in our 2009 Form 10-K, we update the carrying value of our alternative investment portfolio whenever audited financial statements of the investees for the preceding year become available. Our investment income from alternative investments for the first quarter of 2010 included a pre-tax gain of $13 million attributable to audit adjustments to partnerships’ 2009 financial statements. The breakdown of these audit adjustments by segment was as follows: $10 million for Insurance Solutions – Life Insurance; $1 million for Insurance Solutions – Group Protection; $1 million for Retirement Solutions – Annuities; and $1 million for Retirement Solutions – Defined Contribution.        120           Non-Income Producing Investments   As of March 31, 2010, and December 31, 2009, the carrying amount of fixed maturity securities, mortgage loans on real estate and real estate that were non-income producing was $29 million and $38 million, respectively.

The profitability of our fixed annuity and life insurance products is affected by our ability to achieve target spreads, or margins, between the interest income earned on the general account assets and the interest credited to the contract holder on our average fixed account values, including the fixed portion of variable. Net investment income and the interest rate yield table each include commercial mortgage loan prepayments and bond makewhole premiums, alternative investments and contingent interest and standby real estate equity commitments. These items can vary significantly from period to period due to a number of factors and therefore can provide results that are not indicative of the underlying trends.   The increase in net investment income when comparing the first three months of 2010 to the same period of 2009 was attributable to higher account values due primarily to positive net flows and higher invested assets driven primarily by issuances of common stock, preferred stock and debt.   Standby Real Estate Equity Commitments   Historically, we have entered into standby commitments, which obligated us to purchase real estate at a specified cost if a third-party sale does not occur within approximately one year after construction is completed. These commitments were used by a developer to obtain a construction loan from an outside lender on favorable terms. In return for issuing the commitment, we received an annual fee and a percentage of the profit when the property is sold. Our long-term expectation is that we will be obligated to fund a small portion of these commitments that remain outstanding. However, due to the current economic environment, we may experience increased funding obligations.   As of March 31, 2010, and December 31, 2009, we had standby real estate equity commitments totaling $136 million and $220 million, respectively. During the first quarter of March 31, 2010, we funded commitments of $59 million and the fair value of the associated real estate of $31 million was included on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. During 2009, we funded commitments of $46 million and the fair value of the associated real estate of $32 million was included on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, which resulted in the recognition of $14 million in realized losses. In addition, we recorded an estimated loss of $69 million in 2009 on projects due to our belief that our requirement to fund the projects in accordance with the standby equity commitment is probable. The loss related to these projects had funding during the first quarter of 2010 of $28 million. During the first quarter of 2010, we recorded an $8 million loss in addition to the estimated loss of $69 million recorded in 2009.   We have continued to suspend entering into new standby real estate commitments.    Commercial Mortgage Loan Prepayment and Bond Makewhole Premiums   Prepayment and makewhole premiums are collected when borrowers elect to call or prepay their debt prior to the stated maturity. A prepayment or makewhole premium allows investors to attain the same yield as if the borrower made all scheduled interest payments until maturity. These premiums are designed to make investors indifferent to prepayment.   The increase in prepayment and makewhole premiums when comparing 2010 to 2009 was attributable primarily to the overall improvement in the capital markets and real estate financing, which resulted in more refinancing activity and more prepayment income.          122           Realized Loss Related to Investments   The detail of the realized loss related to investments (in millions) was as follows:            For the Three                Months Ended                March 31,                2010       2009       Change      Fixed maturity AFS securities:                      Gross gains    $ 50     $ 55       -9 %   Gross losses      (84 )     (241 )     65 %   Equity AFS securities:                            Gross gains      -       3       -100 %   Gross losses      (4 )     (3 )     -33 %   Loss on other investments      (22 )     (2 )    NM      Associated amortization expense of DAC, VOBA,                            DSI and DFEL and changes in other contract                            holder funds and funds withheld                            reinsurance liabilities      4       55       -93 %   Total realized loss on investments, excluding                            trading securities      (56 )     (133 )     58 %   Gain (loss) on certain derivative instruments      12       (17 )     171 %   Total realized loss on investments and                            certain derivative instruments,                            excluding trading securities    $ (44 )   $ (150 )     71 %    Amortization expense of DAC, VOBA, DSI, DFEL and changes in other contract holder funds reflects an assumption for an expected level of credit-related investment losses. When actual credit-related investment losses are realized, we recognize a true-up to our DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL amortization and changes in other contract holder funds within realized loss reflecting the incremental impact of actual versus expected credit-related investment losses. These actual to expected amortization adjustments could create volatility in net realized gains and losses. The write-down for impairments includes both credit-related and interest-rate related impairments.   Realized gains and losses generally originate from asset sales to reposition the portfolio or to respond to product experience. During the first three months of 2010 and 2009, we sold securities for gains and losses. In the process of evaluating whether a security with an unrealized loss reflects declines that are other-than-temporary, we consider our ability and intent to sell the security prior to a recovery of value. However, subsequent decisions on securities sales are made within the context of overall risk monitoring, assessing value relative to other comparable securities and overall portfolio maintenance. Although our portfolio managers may, at a given point in time, believe that the preferred course of action is to hold securities with unrealized losses that are considered temporary until such losses are recovered, the dynamic nature of portfolio management may result in a subsequent decision to sell. These subsequent decisions are consistent with the classification of our investment portfolio as AFS. We expect to continue to manage all non-trading invested assets within our portfolios in a manner that is consistent with the AFS classification.   We consider economic factors and circumstances within countries and industries where recent write-downs have occurred in our assessment of the status of securities we own of similarly situated issuers. While it is possible for realized or unrealized losses on a particular investment to affect other investments, our risk management has been designed to identify correlation risks and other risks inherent in managing an investment portfolio. Once identified, strategies and procedures are developed to effectively monitor and manage these risks. The areas of risk correlation that we pay particular attention to are risks that may be correlated within specific financial and business markets, risks within specific industries and risks associated with related parties.   When the detailed analysis by our credit analysts and investment portfolio managers leads to the conclusion that a security’s decline in fair value is other-than-temporary, the security is written down to estimated recovery value. In instances where declines are considered temporary, the security will continue to be carefully monitored. See “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” for additional information on our portfolio management strategy in our 2009 Form 10-K.        123           Details underlying write-downs taken as a result of OTTI (in millions) that were recognized in net income (loss) were as follows:            For the Three                Months Ended                March 31,                2010       2009       Change      Fixed Maturity Securities                      Corporate bonds    $ 41     $ 82       -50 %   MBS:                            CMOs      24       81       -70 %   ABS CDOs      1       -      NM      Hybrid and redeemable preferred securities      5       1      NM      Total fixed maturity securities      71       164       -57 %   Equity Securities                            Other financial services securities      3       -      NM      Other securities      -       3       -100 %   Total equity securities      3       3       0 %   Gross OTTI recognized in net income (loss)      74       167       -56 %   Associated amortization expense of DAC,                            VOBA, DSI and DFEL      (21 )     (45 )     53 %   Net OTTI recognized in net income (loss), pre-tax    $ 53     $ 122       -57 %    When comparing the first three months of 2010 to 2009, the decrease in write-downs for OTTI on our AFS securities was attributable primarily to overall improvement in the credit markets as compared to the same period in prior year. Losses in 2010 were attributable primarily to certain corporate bond holdings within the entertainment and banking sectors, as well as deteriorating fundamentals within the housing market that affected select RMBS holdings.   REINSURANCE   See “Part II – Item 7. MD&A – Reinsurance” and Note 9 in our 2009 Form 10-K for information regarding reinsurance transactions.   For factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in this section, see “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2009 Form 10-K and “Forward-Looking Statements – Cautionary Language” above.        124           REVIEW OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION   Liquidity and Capital Resources   Sources of Liquidity and Cash Flow   Liquidity refers to the ability of an enterprise to generate adequate amounts of cash from its normal operations to meet cash requirements with a prudent margin of safety. Our principal sources of cash flow from operating activities are insurance premiums and fees and investment income, while sources of cash flows from investing activities result from maturities and sales of invested assets. Our operating activities provided cash of $565 million for the first three months of 2010 and used cash of $344 million for the first three months of 2009. When considering our liquidity and cash flow, it is important to distinguish between the needs of our insurance subsidiaries and the needs of the holding company, LNC. As a holding company with no operations of its own, LNC derives its cash primarily from its operating subsidiaries.   The sources of liquidity of the holding company are principally comprised of dividends and interest payments from subsidiaries, augmented by holding company short-term investments, bank lines of credit, a commercial paper program and the ongoing availability of long-term public financing under an SEC-filed shelf registration statement. These sources of liquidity and cash flow support the general corporate needs of the holding company, including its common and preferred stock dividends, interest and debt service, funding of callable securities, securities repurchases, repayment of preferred stock, acquisitions and investment in core businesses. Our cash flows associated with collateral received from and posted with counterparties change as the market value of the underlying derivative contract changes. As the value of a derivative asset declines (or increases), the collateral required to be posted by our counterparties would also decline (or increase). Likewise, when the value of a derivative liability declines (or increases), the collateral we are required to post for our counterparties’ benefit would also decline (or increase). During the first three months of 2010, our payables for collateral on derivative investments remained relatively flat, as there was only a decrease of $4 million. For additional information, see “Credit Risk” in Note 6.   We believe that the rating agencies have heightened the level of scrutiny that they apply to the U.S. life insurance sector and may adjust upward the capital and other requirements employed in the rating agency models for maintenance of certain ratings levels. In addition, actions we take to access third party financing may in turn cause rating agencies to reevaluate our ratings. For more information about ratings, see “Part I – Item 1. Business – Ratings” in our 2009 Form 10-K.   Details underlying the primary sources of our holding company cash flows (in millions) were as follows:           For the Three            Months Ended            March 31,            2010       2009     Change    Dividends from Subsidiaries                  Delaware Investments (1)    $ 390     $ 3    NM    Other      15       -    NM    Loan Repayments and Interest from                       Subsidiary                      LNL interest on intercompany notes (2)      22       22    0%       $ 427     $ 25    NM          (1)   For 2010, amount includes proceeds on the sale of Delaware. For more information, see Note 3.        (2)   Primarily represents interest on the holding company’s $1.3 billion in surplus note investments in The Lincoln National Life Insurance Company (“LNL”).      The table above focuses on significant and recurring cash flow items and excludes the effects of certain financing activities, namely the periodic issuance and retirement of debt and cash flows related to our inter-company cash management program (discussed below). Taxes have been eliminated from the analysis due to a tax sharing agreement among our primary subsidiaries resulting in a modest impact on net cash flows at the holding company. Also excluded from this analysis is the modest amount of investment income on short-term investments of the holding company.          125           Dividends from Subsidiaries   Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to certain insurance department regulatory restrictions as to the transfer of funds and payment of dividends to the holding company. Under Indiana laws and regulations, our Indiana insurance subsidiaries, including our primary insurance subsidiary, LNL, may pay dividends to LNC without prior approval of the Indiana Insurance Commissioner (the “Commissioner”) up to a certain threshold, or must receive prior approval of the Commissioner to pay a dividend if such dividend, along with all other dividends paid within the preceding twelve consecutive months exceed the statutory limitation. The current statutory limitation is the greater of 10% of the insurer’s contract holders’ surplus, as shown on its last annual statement on file with the Commissioner or the insurer’s statutory net gain from operations for the prior calendar year. As discussed in “Part I – Item 1. Business – Regulatory – Insurance Regulation” in our 2009 Form 10-K, we may not consider the benefit from the statutory accounting principles relating to our insurance subsidiaries’ deferred tax assets in calculating available dividends. Indiana law gives the Commissioner broad discretion to disapprove requests for dividends in excess of these limits. New York, the state of domicile of our other major insurance subsidiary, The Lincoln Life & Annuity Company of New York, has similar restrictions, except that in New York it is the lesser of 10% of surplus to contract holders as of the immediately preceding calendar year or net gain from operations for the immediately preceding calendar year, not including realized capital gains.   We expect our domestic insurance subsidiaries could pay dividends of approximately $730 million in 2010 without prior approval from the respective state commissioners. The amount of surplus that our insurance subsidiaries could pay as dividends is constrained by the amount of surplus we hold to maintain our ratings, to provide an additional layer of margin for risk protection and for future investment in our businesses.   We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types and maturities. These investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks. An extended disruption in the credit and capital markets could adversely affect LNC and its subsidiaries’ ability to access sources of liquidity, and there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available to us on favorable terms, or at all, in the current market environment. In addition, further OTTI could reduce our statutory surplus, leading to lower RBC ratios and potentially reducing future dividend capacity from our insurance subsidiaries.   Subsidiaries’ Statutory Reserving and Surplus   For discussion of our strategies to lessen the burden of increased AG38 and XXX statutory reserves associated with certain UL products and other products with secondary guarantees subject to these statutory reserving requirements on our insurance subsidiaries, see “Results of Insurance Solutions – Insurance Solutions – Life Insurance – Income from Operations – Strategies to Address Statutory Reserve Strain.”   Financing Activities   Although our subsidiaries currently generate adequate cash flow to meet the needs of our normal operations, periodically we may issue debt or equity securities to maintain ratings and increase liquidity, as well as to fund internal growth, acquisitions and the retirement of our debt and equity securities.   We currently have an effective shelf registration statement, which allows us to issue, in unlimited amounts, securities, including debt securities, preferred stock, common stock, warrants, stock purchase contracts, stock purchase units, depository shares and trust preferred securities of our affiliated trusts.   On January 4, 2010, we closed on the sale of Delaware and received after-tax proceeds of approximately $405 million. There could be post-closing adjustments, some of which are beyond our control, and no assurance can be given as to the timing of its completion as an extension beyond 120 days is allowed in the purchase agreement if there is disagreement during this period. On October 1, 2009, we closed on the sale of Lincoln UK and received after-tax proceeds of $307 million that were used for general corporate purposes. As a result of post-closing adjustments related to this transaction, we received additional consideration of $18 million, after-tax, in the second quarter of 2010. For more information on the disposition of these businesses, see Note 3.          126           Details underlying debt and financing activities (in millions) were as follows:           For the Three Months Ended March 31, 2010                            Change                                  Maturities       in Fair                      Beginning             and       Value       Other       Ending          Balance       Issuance       Repayments       Hedges       Changes (1)       Balance      Short-Term Debt                                        Commercial paper    $ 99     $ -     $ -     $ -     $ 1     $ 100     Current maturities of long-term debt      250       -       (250 )     -       -       -     Other short-term debt      1       -       -       -       -       1     Total short-term debt    $ 350     $ -     $ (250 )   $ -     $ 1     $ 101                                                        Long-Term Debt                                                    Senior notes    $ 2,960     $ -     $ -     $ 9     $ 1     $ 2,970     Bank borrowing      200       -       -       -       -       200     Federal Home Loan Bank                                                    of Indianapolis ("FHLBI") advance      250       -       -       -       -       250     Junior subordinated debentures                                                    issued to affiliated trusts      155       -       -       -       -       155     Capital securities      1,485       -       -       -       -       1,485     Total long-term debt    $ 5,050     $ -     $ -     $ 9     $ 1     $ 5,060           (1)   Includes the net increase (decrease) in commercial paper, non-cash reclassification of long-term debt to current maturities of long-term debt, accretion of discounts and (amortization) of premiums.      On March 12, 2010, we funded the maturity of a $250 million floating rate senior note with the majority of our proceeds from our $300 million 6.25% senior offering in December 2009. We have a $250 million 6.2% fixed rate senior note maturing on December 15, 2011. The specific resources or combination of resources that we will use to meet the 2011 maturity will depend upon, among other things, the financial market conditions present at the time of maturity. As of March 31, 2010, the holding company had $1.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents.   Details underlying our credit facilities with a group of domestic and foreign banks (in millions) were as follows:                 As of March 31, 2010          Expiration       Maximum       Borrowings          Date       Available       Outstanding      Credit Facilities                      Credit facility with the FHLBI (1)      N/A     $ 411     $ 350     Five-year revolving credit facility     Feb-11        1,350       -     Five-year revolving credit facility     Mar-11        1,750       -     Ten-year LOC facility     Dec-19        550       -     Total            $ 4,061     $ 350                                LOCs issued                    $ 2,636           (1)   Our borrowing capacity under this credit facility does not have an expiration date and continues while our investment in the FHLBI common stock remains outstanding as long as LNL maintains a satisfactory level of creditworthiness and does not incur a material adverse change in its financial, business, regulatory or other areas that would materially affect its operations and viability. Of the borrowings outstanding as of March 31, 2010, $250 million is classified within long-term debt and $100 million is classified within payables for collateral on investments on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The maturity dates of the borrowings are discussed below.             127           The LOCs support inter-company reinsurance transactions and specific treaties associated with our business sold through reinsurance. LOCs are used primarily to satisfy the U.S. regulatory requirements of our domestic insurance companies for which reserve credit is provided by our affiliated offshore reinsurance company, as discussed above, and our domestic clients of the business sold through reinsurance.   Under the credit agreements, we must maintain a minimum consolidated net worth level. In addition, the agreements contain covenants restricting our ability to incur liens, merge or consolidate with another entity where we are not the surviving entity and dispose of all or substantially all of our assets. As of March 31, 2010, we were in compliance with all such covenants. All of our credit agreements are unsecured.   If current debt ratings and claims-paying ratings were downgraded in the future, terms in our derivative agreements may be triggered, which could negatively impact overall liquidity. For the majority of our counterparties, there is a termination event should long-term debt ratings of LNC drop below BBB-/Baa3. Our long-term debt held a rating of BBB/Baa2 as of March 31, 2010. In addition, contractual selling agreements with intermediaries could be negatively impacted, which could have an adverse impact on overall sales of annuities, life insurance and investment products. See “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors – A decrease in the capital and surplus of our insurance subsidiaries may result in a downgrade to our credit and insurer financial strength ratings” and “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors – A downgrade in our financial strength or credit ratings could limit our ability to market products, increase the number or value of policies being surrendered and/or hurt our relationships with creditors” in our 2009 Form 10-K for more information. See “Part I – Item 1. Business – Ratings” in our 2009 Form 10-K for additional information on our current bond ratings.   As of March 31, 2010, based on our actual common stock investment, we had borrowing capacity of up to approximately $411 million from the FHLBI. We had a $250 million floating-rate term loan outstanding under the facility due June 20, 2017, which may be prepaid beginning June 20, 2010. We also borrowed $100 million under the facility at a rate of 0.8% that is due June 3, 2010.     Management monitors the covenants associated with LNC’s capital securities. As of March 31, 2010, we had approximately $1.5 billion in principal amount of capital securities outstanding. If we fail to meet capital adequacy or net income and stockholders’ equity levels (also referred to as “trigger events”), terms in the agreements may be triggered, which would require us to make interest payments in accordance with an alternative coupon satisfaction mechanism (“ACSM”). If we determine that one of the following triggers exists as of the 30th day prior to an interest payment date (“determination date”), then the ACSM would apply:          1.   LNL’s RBC ratio is less than 175% (based on the most recent annual financial statement filed with the State of Indiana); or              2.   (i) the sum of our consolidated net income for the four trailing fiscal quarters ending on the quarter that is two quarters prior to the most recently completed quarter prior to the determination date is zero or negative, and (ii) our consolidated stockholders’ equity (excluding accumulated OCI and any increase in stockholders’ equity resulting from the issuance of preferred stock during a quarter) (“adjusted stockholders’ equity”) as of (x) the most recently completed quarter and (y) the end of the quarter that is two quarters before the most recently completed quarter, has declined by 10% or more as compared to the quarter that is ten fiscal quarters prior to the last completed quarter (the “benchmark quarter”).       The ACSM would generally require us to use commercially reasonable efforts to satisfy our obligation to pay interest in full on the capital securities with the net proceeds from sales of our common stock and warrants to purchase our common stock with an exercise price greater than the market price. We would have to utilize the ACSM until the trigger events above no longer existed, and, in the case of test 2 above, our adjusted stockholders’ equity amount increased or declined by less than 10% as compared to the adjusted stockholders’ equity at the end of the benchmark quarter for each interest payment date as to which interest payment restrictions were imposed by test 2 above.   If we were required to utilize the ACSM and were successful in selling sufficient shares of common stock or warrants to satisfy the interest payment, we would dilute the current holders of our common stock. Furthermore, while a trigger event is occurring and if we do not pay accrued interest in full, we may not, among other things, pay dividends on or repurchase our capital stock. Our failure to pay interest pursuant to the ACSM will not result in an event of default with respect to the capital securities, nor will a nonpayment of interest, unless it lasts for ten consecutive years, although such breaches may result in monetary damages to the holders of the capital securities.   In recent quarters, we have triggered the net income test as a result of quarterly consolidated net losses. However, recent quarterly consolidated net income and our efforts to raise capital in the form of equity in 2009 resulted in no trigger of the net income test or the overall stockholders’ equity test looking forward to the quarter ending September 30, 2010.          128           The calculations of RBC, net income (loss) and adjusted stockholders’ equity are subject to adjustments and the capital securities are subject to additional terms and conditions as further described in supplemental indentures filed as exhibits to our Forms 8-K filed on March 13, 2007, May 17, 2006, and April 20, 2006.    For more information, see “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors – We will be required to pay interest on our capital securities with proceeds from the issuance of qualifying securities if we fail to achieve capital adequacy or net income and stockholders’ equity levels” and Note 13 in our 2009 Form 10-K.    For information regarding our participation in the TARP CPP, see “Introduction – Executive Summary – Current Market Conditions” above.      Alternative Sources of Liquidity    In order to manage our capital more efficiently, we have an inter-company cash management program where certain subsidiaries can lend to or borrow from the holding company to meet short-term borrowing needs. The cash management program is essentially a series of demand loans, which are permitted under applicable insurance laws, among LNC and its affiliates that reduces overall borrowing costs by allowing LNC and its subsidiaries to access internal resources instead of incurring third-party transaction costs. For our Indiana-domiciled insurance subsidiaries, the borrowing and lending limit is currently the lesser of 3% of the insurance company’s admitted assets and 25% of its surplus, in both cases, as of its most recent year end.   The holding company did not borrow from the cash management program during the first quarter of 2010. There was no balance as of March 31, 2010. In addition, the holding company had an outstanding payable of $104 million to certain subsidiaries resulting from amounts placed by the subsidiaries in the inter-company cash management account in excess of funds borrowed by those subsidiaries as of March 31, 2010. Any increase (decrease) in either of these holding company cash management program payable balances results in an immediate and equal increase (decrease) to holding company cash and cash equivalents.   Our insurance subsidiaries, by virtue of their general account fixed income investment holdings, can access liquidity through securities lending programs and repurchase agreements. As of March 31, 2010, our insurance subsidiaries had securities with a carrying value of $440 million out on loan under the securities lending program and $335 million carrying value subject to reverse-repurchase agreements. The cash received in our securities lending program is typically invested in cash equivalents, short-term investments or fixed maturity securities.   LNC has a $1.0 billion commercial paper program that was rated A-2, P-2 and F2 as of March 31, 2010. The commercial paper program is backed by a bank line of credit. During the first quarter of 2010, LNC had an average of $101 million in commercial paper outstanding with a maximum amount of $117 million outstanding at any time. LNC had $100 million of commercial paper outstanding as of March 31, 2010.   For factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in this section, see “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2009 Form 10-K and “Forward-Looking Statements – Cautionary Language” above.   Divestitures   For a discussion of our divestitures, see “Part I – Item 1. Business – Acquisitions and Dispositions” in our 2009 Form 10-K and Note 3.   Uses of Capital   Our principal uses of cash are to pay policy claims and benefits, operating expenses, commissions and taxes, to purchase new investments, to purchase reinsurance, to fund policy surrenders and withdrawals, to pay dividends to our stockholders and to repurchase our stock and debt securities.   Return of Capital to Common Stockholders   One of the Company’s primary goals is to provide a return to our common stockholders through share price accretion, dividends and stock repurchases. In determining dividends, the Board takes into consideration items such as current and expected earnings, capital needs, rating agency considerations and requirements for financial flexibility. As a result of our participation in the TARP CPP, we are subject to limits on increasing the dividend on our common stock (unless the U.S. Treasury consents), which apply until July 10, 2012, unless we prior to that date redeem the Series B preferred shares in whole or the U.S. Treasury transfers all of the Series B preferred stock to third parties.          129           Details underlying this activity (in millions) were as follows:           For the Three                Months Ended                March 31,                2010       2009       Change      Common dividends to stockholders    $ 3     $ 54       -94 %     Significant Trends in Sources and Uses of Cash Flow   As stated above, LNC’s cash flow, as a holding company, is largely dependent upon the dividend capacity of its insurance company subsidiaries as well as their ability to advance funds to it through inter-company borrowing arrangements, which may be impacted by factors influencing the insurance subsidiaries’ RBC and statutory earnings performance. We currently expect to be able to meet the holding company’s ongoing cash needs and to have sufficient capital to offer downside protection in the event that the capital and credit markets experience another period of extreme volatility and disruption. We are exploring our options with regard to protecting and building capital at the insurance company subsidiaries, which may include, depending on then current market conditions and other factors, potential securitizations of reserves, reinsurance transactions and sales of corporate assets. A continuation of or an acceleration of poor capital market conditions, which reduces our insurance subsidiaries’ statutory surplus and RBC, may require them to retain more capital and may pressure our subsidiaries’ dividends to the holding company, which may lead us to take steps to preserve or raise additional capital. For factors that could affect our expectations for liquidity and capital, see “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2009 Form 10-K.   OTHER MATTERS   Other Factors Affecting Our Business   In general, our businesses are subject to a changing social, economic, legal, legislative and regulatory environment. Some of the changes include initiatives to require more reserves to be carried by our insurance subsidiaries. Although the eventual effect on us of the changing environment in which we operate remains uncertain, these factors and others could have a material effect on our results of operations, liquidity and capital resources. For factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in this section, see “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2009 Form 10-K and “Forward-Looking Statements – Cautionary Language” in this report.   Recent Accounting Pronouncements   See Note 2 for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements that have been implemented during the periods presented or that have been issued and are to be implemented in the future.   Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk   We analyze and manage the risks arising from market exposures of financial instruments, as well as other risks, in an integrated asset-liability management process that takes diversification into account. By aggregating the potential effect of market and other risks on the entire enterprise, we estimate, review and in some cases manage the risk to our earnings and shareholder value. We have exposures to several market risks including interest rate risk, foreign currency exchange risk, equity market risk, default risk, basis risk and credit risk. The exposures of financial instruments to market risks, and the related risk management process, are most important to our Retirement Solutions and Insurance Solutions businesses, where most of the invested assets support accumulation and investment-oriented insurance products. As an important element of our integrated asset-liability management process, we use derivatives to minimize the effects of changes in interest levels, the shape of the yield curve, currency movements and volatility. In this context, derivatives are designated as a hedge and serve to minimize interest rate risk by mitigating the effect of significant increases in interest rates on our earnings. Additional market exposures exist in our other general account insurance products and in our debt structure and derivatives positions. Our primary sources of market risk are: substantial, relatively rapid and sustained increases or decreases in interest rates; fluctuations in currency exchange rates; or a sharp drop in equity market values. These market risks are discussed in detail in the following pages and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements (“Notes”) presented in “Item 1. Financial Statements,” as well as “Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” (“MD&A”).          130           Derivatives   We have entered into derivative transactions to hedge our exposure to rapid changes in interest rates. The derivative programs are used to help us achieve somewhat stable margins while providing competitive crediting rates to contract holders during periods when interest rates are changing. Such derivatives include interest rate swap agreements, interest rate futures, interest rate cap agreements, forward-starting interest rate swaps, consumer price index swaps, interest rate cap corridors and treasury locks. See Note 6 for additional information on our derivatives used to hedge our exposure to changes in interest rates.   In addition to continuing existing programs, we may use derivative instruments in other strategies to limit risk and enhance returns, particularly in the management of investment spread businesses. We have established policies, guidelines and internal control procedures for the use of derivatives as tools to enhance management of the overall portfolio of risks assumed in our operations. Annually, our Board of Directors reviews our derivatives policy.   Impact of Equity Market Sensitivity   Due to the use of our reversion to the mean (“RTM”) process and our hedging strategies as described in “MD&A – Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” in Item 2 above and in Item 7 of our 2009 Form 10-K, we expect that, in general, short-term fluctuations in the equity markets should not have a significant impact on our quarterly earnings from unlocking of assumptions for deferred acquisition costs, value of business acquired, deferred sales inducements and deferred front-end loads, as we do not unlock our long-term equity market assumptions based upon short-term fluctuations in the equity markets. However, there is an impact to earnings from the effects of equity market movements on account values and assets under management and the related asset-based fees we earn on those assets net of related expenses we incur based upon the level of assets.   The following table presents our estimate of the impact on income from operations (in millions), from the change in asset-based fees and related expenses, if the level of the Standard & Poor’s (“S&P”) 500 Index® (“S&P 500”) were to drop to 1000 immediately after March 31, 2010, and remain at that level through the next twelve months or dropped to 800 immediately after March 31, 2010, and remain at that level through the next twelve months, excluding any impact related to sales, prospective unlocking, persistency, hedge program performance or customer behavior caused by the equity market change:           S&P 500       S&P 500          at 1000 (1)       at 800 (1)      Segment                Retirement Solutions - Annuities (2)    $ (55 )   $ (130 )   Retirement Solutions - Defined Contribution (2)      (10 )     (30 )         (1)   The baseline for these impacts assumes 9% annual equity market growth beginning on April 1, 2010. The baseline is then compared to scenarios of S&P 500 at the 800 and 1000 levels, which assume the index stays at those levels for the next twelve months and grows at 9% annually thereafter. The difference between the baseline and S&P 500 at the 800 and 1000 level scenarios is presented in the table.        (2)   If the level of the S&P 500 dropped to 800 immediately after March 31, 2010, and remained at that level in subsequent periods we project that we would have a RTM prospective unlocking of approximately $220 million to $280 million, after-tax, for Retirement Solutions late in 2012. If the level of the S&P 500 dropped to 1000 immediately after March 31, 2010, and remained at that level in subsequent periods we project that we would have a RTM prospective unlocking of approximately $140 million to $180 million, after-tax, for Retirement Solutions late in 2014.      The impact on earnings summarized above is an expected effect for the next twelve months. The effect of quarterly equity market changes upon fee revenues and asset-based expenses will not be fully recognized in the current quarter because fee revenues are earned and related expenses are incurred based upon daily variable account values. The difference between the current period average daily variable account values compared to the end of period variable account values impacts fee revenues in subsequent periods. Additionally, the impact on earnings may not necessarily be symmetrical with comparable increases in the equity markets. This discussion concerning the estimated effects of ongoing equity market volatility on the fees we earn from account values and assets under management is intended to be illustrative. Actual effects may vary depending on a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control, such as changing customer behaviors that might result in changes in the mix of our business between variable and fixed annuity contracts, switching among investment alternatives available within variable products, changes in sales production levels or changes in policy persistency. For purposes of this guidance, the change in account values is assumed to correlate with the change in the relevant index.          131           Credit-Related Derivatives   We use credit-related derivatives to minimize our exposure to credit-related events and we also sell credit default swaps to offer credit protection to our contract holders. For additional information, see Note 6.   Credit Risk    Through the use of derivative instruments, we are exposed to both credit risk (our counterparty fails to make payment) and market risk (the value of the instrument falls). When the fair value of a derivative contract is positive, this generally indicates that the counterparty owes us and, therefore, creates a credit risk for us equal to the extent of the fair value gain in the derivative. When the fair value of a derivative contract is negative, this generally indicates we owe the counterparty and therefore we have no credit risk, but have been affected by market risk. We minimize the credit risk in derivative instruments by entering into transactions with high quality counterparties with minimum credit ratings that are reviewed regularly by us, by limiting the amount of credit exposure to any one counterparty and by requiring certain counterparties to post collateral if our credit risk exceeds certain limits. We also maintain a policy of requiring all derivative contracts to be governed by an International Swaps and Derivatives Association (“ISDA”) Master Agreement. We do not believe that the credit or market risks associated with derivative instruments are material to any insurance subsidiary or to us.   We have derivative positions with counterparties. Assuming zero recovery value, our exposure is the positive market value of the derivative positions with a counterparty, less collateral, that would be lost if the counterparty were to default. As of March 31, 2010, and December 31, 2009, our counterparty risk exposure, net of collateral, was $294 million and $292 million, respectively. As of March 31, 2010, we had exposure to 18 counterparties, with a maximum exposure of $125 million, net of collateral, to a single counterparty. The credit risk associated with such agreements is minimized by purchasing such agreements from financial institutions with long-standing, superior performance records. For the majority of Lincoln National Corporation counterparties, there is a termination event should long-term debt ratings of LNC rating drop below BBB-/Baa3. Additionally, we maintain a policy of requiring all derivative contracts to be governed by an ISDA Master Agreement.   Our fair value of counterparty exposure (in millions) was as follows:                        As of     As of          March 31,     December 31,          2010     2009      Rating              AAA    $ 3   $ -     AA      196     202    A     87     82     BBB     8    8     Total    $ 294   $ 292       Item 4. Controls and Procedures   Conclusions Regarding Disclosure Controls and Procedures   We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, which are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As of the end of the period covered by this report, we, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as that term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting them to material information relating to us and our consolidated subsidiaries required to be disclosed in our periodic reports under the Exchange Act.          132           Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting   There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as that term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended March 31, 2010, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.   A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the company have been detected. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.   PART II – OTHER INFORMATION   Item 1.
