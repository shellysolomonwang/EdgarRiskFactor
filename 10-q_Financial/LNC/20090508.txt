Item 1A. Risk Factors,” as updated in “Part II – Item 1A. Risk Factors” below, “Part II – Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and “Part II – Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”   In this report, in addition to providing consolidated revenues and net income (loss), we also provide segment operating revenues and income (loss) from operations because we believe they are meaningful measures of revenues and the profitability of our operating segments. Income (loss) from operations is net income recorded in accordance with United States of America generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) excluding the after-tax effects of the following items, as applicable:       ·  Realized gains and losses associated with the following (“excluded realized loss”):        §  Sale or disposal of securities;        §  Impairments of securities;        §  Change in the fair value of embedded derivatives within certain reinsurance arrangements and the change in the fair value of related trading securities;        §  Change in the fair value of the embedded derivatives of our guaranteed living benefits (“GLB”) within our variable annuities net of the change in the fair value of the derivatives we own to hedge the changes in the embedded derivative (“GLB net derivative results”);        §  Net difference between the benefit ratio unlocking of Statement of Position (“SOP”) No. 03-1, “Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises for Certain Nontraditional Long-Duration Contracts and for Separate Accounts” (“SOP 03-1”) reserves on our guaranteed death benefit (“GDB”) riders within our variable annuities and the change in the fair value of the derivatives excluding our expected cost of purchasing the hedging instruments (“GDB derivatives results”); and        §  Changes in the fair value of the embedded derivative liabilities related to index call options we may purchase in the future to hedge contract holder index allocations applicable to future reset periods for our indexed annuity products as required under Statements of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” (“SFAS 133”) and SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements” (“SFAS 157”) (“Indexed annuity forward-starting option”).     ·  Income (loss) from the initial adoption of changes in accounting principles;     ·  Income (loss) from reserve changes (net of related amortization) on business sold through reinsurance;     ·  Gain (loss) on early retirement of debt, including subordinated debt;     ·  Losses from the impairment of intangible assets; and     ·  Income (loss) from discontinued operations.   Operating revenues represent GAAP revenues excluding the pre-tax effects of the following items, as applicable:       ·  Excluded realized loss;     ·  Amortization of deferred gains arising from the reserve changes on business sold through reinsurance; and     ·  Revenue adjustments from the initial impact of the adoption of changes in accounting principles.   Operating revenues and income (loss) from operations are the financial performance measures we use to evaluate and assess the results of our segments. Accordingly, we report operating revenues and income (loss) from operations by segment in Note 16. Our management and Board of Directors believe that operating revenues and income (loss) from operations explain the results of our ongoing businesses in a manner that allows for a better understanding of the underlying trends in our current businesses because the excluded items are unpredictable and not necessarily indicative of current operating fundamentals or future performance of the business segments, and, in many instances, decisions regarding these items do not necessarily relate to the operations of the individual segments. Operating revenues and income (loss) from operations do not replace revenues and net income as the GAAP measures of our consolidated results of operations.       47       Beginning with the quarter ended June 30, 2008, we changed our definitions of segment operating revenues and income from operations to better reflect: the underlying economics of our variable and indexed annuities that employ derivative instruments to hedge policy benefits; and the manner in which management evaluates that business. Our change in the definition of income from operations is primarily the result of our adoption of SFAS 157 during the first quarter of 2008. Under the fair value measurement provisions of SFAS 157, we are required to measure the fair value of these annuities from an “exit price” perspective, (i.e., the exchange price between market participants to transfer the liability). We, therefore, must include margins that a market participant buyer would require as well as a factor for non-performance risk (“NPR”) related to our credit quality. We do not believe that these factors relate to the economics of the underlying business and do not reflect the manner in which management evaluates the business. The items that are now excluded from our operating results that were previously included are as follows: GLB net derivatives results; indexed annuity forward-starting option; and GDB derivatives results. For more information regarding this change, see our current report on Form 8-K dated July 16, 2008.   We continue to exclude the effects of any realized gain (loss) on investments from segment operating revenues and income from operations as we believe that such items are not necessarily indicative of current operating fundamentals or future performance of the business segments, and, in many instances, decisions regarding these items do not necessarily relate to the operations of the individual segments.   We believe that our new definitions of operating revenues and income (loss) from operations will provide investors with a more valuable measure of our performance because it better reveals trends in our business. See “Realized Loss” below for more information about these items.   Certain reclassifications have been made to prior periods’ financial information. Included in these reclassifications is the change in our definition of segment operating revenues and income (loss) from operations as discussed above. To that end, we have reclassified the results of certain derivatives and embedded derivatives to realized loss, which were previously reported within insurance fees, net investment income, interest credited or benefits. The associated amortization expense of deferred acquisition costs (“DAC”) and value of business acquired (“VOBA”) (previously reported within underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses), deferred sales inducements (“DSI”) (previously reported within interest credited), deferred front-end loads (“DFEL”) (previously reported within insurance fees) and changes in contract holder funds (previously reported within benefits) have also been reclassified to realized loss. See “Basis of Presentation” in Note 1 for details.

    ·  A decline in the equity markets causing a reduction in the sales of LNC’s products, a reduction of asset-based fees that LNC charges on various investment and insurance products, an acceleration of amortization of DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL and an increase in liabilities related to guaranteed benefit features of LNC’s variable annuity products;     ·  Ineffectiveness of LNC’s various hedging strategies used to offset the impact of changes in the value of liabilities due to changes in the level and volatility of the equity markets and interest rates;     ·  A deviation in actual experience regarding future persistency, mortality, morbidity, interest rates or equity market returns from LNC’s assumptions used in pricing its products, in establishing related insurance reserves and in the amortization of intangibles that may result in an increase in reserves and a decrease in net income, including as a result of stranger-originated life insurance business;     ·  Changes in GAAP that may result in unanticipated changes to LNC’s net income;     ·  Lowering of one or more of LNC’s debt ratings issued by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations and the adverse impact such action may have on LNC’s ability to raise capital and on its liquidity and financial condition;     ·  Lowering of one or more of the insurer financial strength ratings of LNC’s insurance subsidiaries and the adverse impact such action may have on the premium writings, policy retention, profitability of its insurance subsidiaries and liquidity;     ·  Significant credit, accounting, fraud or corporate governance issues that may adversely affect the value of certain investments in the portfolios of LNC’s companies requiring that LNC realize losses on such investments;     ·  The impact of acquisitions and divestitures, restructurings, product withdrawals and other unusual items, including LNC’s ability to integrate acquisitions and to obtain the anticipated results and synergies from acquisitions;

    ·  Competitive conditions, including pricing pressures, new product offerings and the emergence of new competitors, that may affect the level of premiums and fees that LNC can charge for its products;     ·  The unknown impact on LNC’s business resulting from changes in the demographics of LNC’s client base, as aging baby-boomers move from the asset-accumulation stage to the asset-distribution stage of life; and     ·  Loss of key management, portfolio managers in the Investment Management segment, financial planners or wholesalers.   The risks included here are not exhaustive. Other sections of this report, our 2008 Form 10-K, current reports on Form 8-K and other documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) include additional factors that could impact LNC’s business and financial performance, including “Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” and the risk discussions included in this section under “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates,” “Consolidated Investments” and “Reinsurance,” which are incorporated herein by reference. Moreover, LNC operates in a rapidly changing and competitive environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors.   Further, it is not possible to assess the impact of all risk factors on LNC’s business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results. In addition, LNC disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that occur after the date of this report.         49       INTRODUCTION   Executive Summary   We are a holding company that operates multiple insurance and investment management businesses through subsidiary companies. Through our business segments, we sell a wide range of wealth protection, accumulation and retirement income products and solutions. These products include institutional and/or retail fixed and indexed annuities, variable annuities, universal life insurance (“UL”), variable universal life insurance (“VUL”), linked-benefit UL, term life insurance, mutual funds and managed accounts.   On July 21, 2008, we announced the realignment of our segments under our former Employer Markets and Individual Markets businesses into two new businesses – Retirement Solutions and Insurance Solutions. We believe the new structure more closely aligns with consumer needs and should lead to more coordinated product development and greater effectiveness across the enterprise. The only change to our segment reporting is reporting the results of the Executive Benefits business, which as of June 30, 2008, was part of the Retirement Products segment, in the Life Insurance segment. Accordingly, beginning in the third quarter of 2008, we provide products and services in four operating business and report results through six segments as follows:         Business    Corresponding Segments  Retirement Solutions    Annuities      Defined Contribution (formerly Retirement Products)        Insurance Solutions    Life Insurance (including Executive Benefits business)      Group Protection        Investment Management    Investment Management        Lincoln UK    Lincoln UK     These changes to the Retirement Products and the Life Insurance segments are in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 131, “Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information,” and reflect the manner in which we are organized for purposes of making operating decisions and assessing performance. Our segment results are reported under this new structure beginning in the third quarter of 2008, and we have restated results from prior periods in a consistent manner. We view the changes to the existing segments as immaterial. These operating businesses and their segments are described in “Part I – Item 1. Business” of our 2008 Form 10-K.   We also have Other Operations, which includes the financial data for operations that are not directly related to the business segments. Other Operations also includes our run-off Institutional Pension business and the results of our remaining media businesses.    Current Market Conditions   During the first quarter of 2009, the capital markets continued to experience high volatility that affected both equity market returns and interest rates. In addition, credit spreads widened across asset classes and reduced liquidity in the credit markets. The price of our common stock declined during the first quarter of 2009 to close at $6.69 on March 31, 2009, as compared to $18.84 on December 31, 2008, and during that time it traded at a low of $4.90. During the first quarter of 2009, analysts and economists noted that the US economy lost more jobs in 2008 than in any year subsequent to World War II and projected that the economic recovery might take longer than previously expected. We also experienced a series of ratings downgrades as depressed capital markets continued to strain our liquidity as we prepared to fund debt maturities in the second quarter of 2009.   Earnings in 2009 will continue to be unfavorably impacted by the significant decline in the equity markets. Due to these challenges, the capital markets had a significant effect on our segment income (loss) from operations and consolidated net income during the first quarter of 2009. In the face of these capital market challenges, we continue to focus on building our businesses through these difficult markets and beyond by developing and introducing high quality products, expanding distribution in new and existing key accounts and channels and targeting market segments that have high growth potential while maintaining a disciplined approach to managing our expenses. The markets impacted primarily the following areas:         50       Adequacy of Our Liquidity and Capital Positions   We are committed to managing our capital effectively, particularly during this difficult environment. The continued adequacy of our liquidity resources to meet requirements of our businesses and our holding company depends upon such factors as market conditions and our ability to access sources of liquidity. In addition, market volatility has impacted the level of capital required to support our businesses.   Given this dynamic and challenging environment, we are taking measures to prudently and actively manage our liquidity and capital positions, such as reducing the dividend on our common stock, suspending stock repurchase activity, restructuring the company to reduce overall expenses and entering into a recent reinsurance transaction to provide statutory capital for our primary insurance subsidiary. We are exploring other options, such as additional reinsurance transactions, securitizations and possible asset sales, that will help strengthen the capital positions of our insurance businesses.   Currently, we expect to meet the ongoing cash needs of the holding company with a combination of commercial paper as available, our inter-company cash management program and available lines of credit. We believe that these borrowing sources in combination with savings from the measures mentioned above will satisfy reduced holding company cash requirements for the foreseeable future. See “Part II – Item 1A. Risk Factors” in this report for more information.   For more information on our liquidity and capital positions, see “Review of Consolidated Financial Condition” below.   Ratings   Since the filing of our 2008 Form 10-K, Moody’s and Fitch both downgraded certain of our financial strength ratings and debt ratings. On April 15, 2009, Moody’s downgraded our long-term credit rating to Baa2 (9th of 21) and also downgraded the financial strength ratings of The Lincoln National Life Insurance Company (“LNL”), Lincoln Life and Annuity Company of New York (“LLANY”) and First Penn-Pacific Life Insurance Company (“FPP”) to A2/A2/A2 (6th of 21), respectively. All ratings are currently under review for possible downgrade, which indicates that our ratings could be affirmed or lowered in the near term based on developments in financial market conditions and/or our business performance or financial measures. On April 16, 2009, Fitch downgraded our short-term debt ratings to F-2 (3rd of 7) and our long-term debt ratings to BBB (9th of 21) and also downgraded the financial strength ratings of LNL, LLANY and FPP to A+/A+/A+ (5th of 21), respectively. Fitch’s outlook on all of our ratings remained negative. In addition, on May 6, 2009, Standard & Poor’s (“S&P”) revised its outlook for the holding company and insurance subsidiaries to negative from stable and affirmed all ratings.   Earnings from Assets Under Management   Our asset-gathering segments – Retirement Solutions – Annuities, Retirement Solutions – Defined Contribution and Investment Management – are the most sensitive to the equity markets. We discuss the earnings impact of the equity markets on account values, assets under management and the related asset-based fees below in “Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – Equity Market Risk – Impact of Equity Market Sensitivity.” From December 31, 2008, to March 31, 2009, the daily average value of the S&P 500 Index® (“S&P 500”) decreased 10%. Solely as a result of the equity markets, our assets under management as of March 31, 2009, were down $5.8 billion from December 31, 2008. Strong deposits in the first quarter of 2009 have only helped to partially offset this impact, compared to the same period in 2008. The effect of the negative equity markets on our assets under management that we experienced in 2008 and the first quarter of 2009 will continue to dampen our earnings throughout 2009 even if the equity market returns become consistent with our long-term assumptions. Accordingly, we may continue to report lower asset-based fees, higher DAC and VOBA amortization and higher reserves related to our GDB guarantees relative to expectations or prior periods.   Investment Income on Alternative Investments   We believe that overall market conditions in both the equity and credit markets caused our alternative investments portfolio, which consists mostly of hedge funds and various limited partnership investments, to under-perform relative to our long-term return expectations, and we expect these assets to continue to under-perform at least in the short term. These investments impact primarily our Insurance Solutions – Life Insurance, Retirement Solutions – Annuities and Retirement Solutions – Defined Contribution segments. See “Consolidated Investments – Alternative Investments” for additional information on our investment portfolio.         51       Variable Annuity Hedge Program Results   We offer variable annuity products with living benefit guarantees. As described below in “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Derivatives – Guaranteed Living Benefits,” we use derivative instruments to hedge our exposure to the risks and earnings volatility that result from the embedded derivatives for living benefits in certain of our variable annuity products. The change in fair value of these instruments tends to move in the opposite direction of the change in fair value of the embedded derivatives. For the first quarter of 2009, the market conditions noted above negatively affected the net result of the change in the fair value of the living benefit embedded derivative, excluding the effect of our NPR factor, and the change in fair value of the hedging derivatives. The NPR factor used in the calculation of the embedded derivative liability relates to the change in the spreads of our credit default swaps and the associated volume related to volatilities and interest rates adjusted for factors such as liquidity and the priority of our claims-paying rating and had an unfavorable effect on the overall result during the first three months of 2009. These results are excluded from operating revenues and income from operations.   We also offer variable products with death benefit guarantees. As described below in “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Future Contract Benefits and Other Contract Holder Obligations – Guaranteed Death Benefits,” we use derivative instruments to attempt to hedge in the opposite direction of the impact to our associated reserves for movements in equity markets. These results are excluded from income (loss) from operations.   Variable Annuity Business Model   In order to address the realities of the current market conditions in the variable annuity marketplace, in late January, we introduced changes to our GLB riders including increased rider fees, reduced roll-up periods and tighter investment restrictions on new business and a large percentage of in-force account value. Increased equity market implied volatility and falling interest rates have increased the cost of providing GLBs. The January product changes reduce our exposure to equity market volatility and interest rate movements while compensating us for increasing costs to provide the benefits.   Credit Losses, Impairments and Unrealized Losses   Related to our investments in fixed income and equity securities, we experienced net realized losses which reduced net income by $87 million for the three months ended March 31, 2009, and included credit related write-downs of securities for other-than-temporary impairments (“OTTI”) of $139 million. Widening spreads was the primary cause of a $247 million increase in gross unrealized losses on the available-for-sale (“AFS”) fixed maturity securities in our general account for the three months ended March 31, 2009. These unrealized losses were concentrated in the investment grade category of investments and demonstrate how reduced liquidity in the credit markets have resulted in a decline in asset values as investors shift their investments to less volatile government securities, such as U.S. Treasuries. In addition, continued weakness in the economic environment could lead to increased credit defaults, resulting in additional write-downs of securities for OTTI.   Stimulus Legislation   In reaction to the recession, credit market illiquidity and global financial crisis experienced during the latter part of 2008 and into 2009, Congress enacted the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (“EESA”) on October 3, 2008, and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (“ARRA”) which was signed into law on February 17, 2009, in an effort to restore liquidity to the U.S. credit markets and stimulate the U.S. economy. The EESA defines financial institutions to include insurance companies and contains the TARP. The ARRA and TARP authorized the purchase of “troubled assets” from financial institutions, including insurance companies. Pursuant to the authority granted under the TARP, the U.S. Treasury also adopted the Capital Purchase Program (“CPP”), the Generally Available Capital Access Program and the Exceptional Financial Recovery Assistance Program. Under the CPP, as currently adopted, bank and thrift holding companies may apply to the U.S. Treasury for the direct sale of preferred stock and warrants to the U.S. Treasury. It remains unclear at this point, if and when the EESA and ARRA will restore sustained liquidity and confidence in the markets and its affect on the fair value of our invested assets.    On January 8, 2009, the Office of Thrift Supervision approved our application to become a savings and loan holding company and our acquisition of Newton County Loan & Savings, FSB, a federally regulated savings bank, located in Indiana. We contributed $10 million to the capital of Newton County Loan & Savings, FSB, and closed on the purchase on January 15, 2009. We also previously filed an application to participate in the CPP. Our application to participate in the CPP is subject to approval from the U.S. Treasury. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will be able to participate in the CPP or any of the other programs or that we will participate if available.         52       Challenges and Outlook   For the remainder 2009, we expect major challenges to include:       ·  Continuation of volatility in the equity markets, resulting in hedge breakage and possible additional erosion in variable account values;     ·  Continuation of illiquid credit markets and impact on spreads and on other-than-temporary securities impairments;     ·  Continuation of the current credit and capital market conditions, restricting our ability to access capital;     ·  Continuation of the low interest rate environment, which creates a challenge for our products that generate investment margin profits, such as fixed annuities and UL;     ·  Possible additional intangible asset impairments, such as goodwill, if the financial performance of our reporting units does not improve, our market capitalization remains below book value for a prolonged period of time or business valuation assumptions (such as discount rates and equity market volatility) deteriorate further;     ·  Continuation of the recession and other challenges in the economy;     ·  Achieving success in our portfolio of products, marketplace acceptance of new variable annuity features and maintaining management and wholesalers that will help maintain our competitive position; and     ·  Continuation of focus by the government on tax reform including potential changes in company dividends-received deduction (“DRD”) calculations, which may impact our products and overall earnings.   In the face of these challenges, we expect to focus on the following throughout the remainder of 2009:       ·  Continue near term product development in our manufacturing units and future product development initiatives, with particular focus on further reducing risk related to guaranteed benefit riders offered with certain variable annuities;     ·  Evaluate and potentially pursue the sale of non-core businesses and other options to raise additional capital;     ·  Manage our expenses aggressively and utilize cost reduction initiatives and continue embedding financial and execution discipline throughout our operations; and     ·  Substantially complete the remaining platform and system consolidations necessary to achieve the final portion of integration cost saves as well as prepare us for more effective customer interaction in the future.   For additional factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in this section, see “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2008 Form 10-K, as updated in “Part II – Item 1A. Risk Factors” below, and “Forward-Looking Statements – Cautionary Language” in this report.   Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates   The MD&A included in our 2008 Form 10-K contains a detailed discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates. The following information updates the critical accounting policies and estimates provided in our 2008 Form 10-K and, accordingly, should be read in conjunction with the critical accounting policies and estimates discussed in our 2008 Form 10-K.   Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets   Under SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,” (“SFAS 142”) goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized, but are subject to impairment tests conducted at least annually. Intangibles that do not have indefinite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives. SFAS 142 requires that we perform a two-step test in our evaluation of the carrying value of goodwill. In Step 1 of the evaluation, the fair value of each reporting unit is determined and compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit. If the fair value is greater than the carrying value, then the carrying value is deemed to be sufficient and Step 2 is not required. If the fair value estimate is less than the carrying value, it is an indicator that impairment may exist and Step 2 is required to be performed. In Step 2, the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill is determined by allocating the reporting unit’s fair value as determined in Step 1 to all of its net assets (recognized and unrecognized) as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination at the date of the impairment test. If the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill is lower than its carrying amount, goodwill is impaired and written down to its fair value. Refer to Note 8 of our consolidated financial statements for goodwill by reporting unit.   We use October 1 as the annual review date for goodwill and other intangible assets impairment testing. However, when factors indicate that an impairment could be present, we reassess our conclusions related to goodwill recoverability through completion of an interim test. Subsequent reviews of goodwill could result in impairment of goodwill during 2009. Due to volatile capital markets and their unfavorable impact to our liquidity, earnings and discount rate assumptions and the execution of a reinsurance transaction on our life business, we completed an interim test of goodwill impairment as of March 31, 2009.       53       We performed a Step 1 goodwill impairment analysis on all of our reporting units as of March 31, 2009. The Step 1 analysis for Insurance Solutions – Life and Retirement Solutions – Annuities reporting units utilized primarily a discounted cash flow valuation technique. In determining the estimated fair value of these reporting units, we incorporated consideration of discounted cash flow calculations, the level of our own share price and assumptions that market participants would make in valuing these reporting units. Our fair value estimations were based primarily on an in-depth analysis of projected future cash flows and relevant discount rates, which considered market participant inputs (“income approach”). The discounted cash flow analysis required us to make judgments about revenues, earnings projections, capital market assumptions and discount rates. The key assumptions used in the analysis to determine the fair value of these reporting units included:       ·  New business for 10 years and run off of cash flows on in-force and new business for the life of the reporting unit;     ·  Adjustments of several assumptions in our projections to reflect conservatism in the near-term as a result of the current volatility in the capital markets, including:        §  Lower equity market returns for 2 years;        §  Lower alternative investment income returns for 2 years;        §  Higher line of credit costs related to reserve securitizations;     ·  Discount rates ranging from 11.0% to 16.0%, which were based on the weighted average cost of capital for each of our reporting units adjusted for the risks associated with the operations. We used 11.0% for our Insurance Solutions – Life reporting unit and 16.0% for our Retirement Solutions – Annuities reporting unit.   For our other reporting units, we used other available information including market data obtained through strategic reviews and other analysis to support our Step 1 conclusions.   All of our reporting units passed the Step 1 analysis, except for our Retirement Solutions – Annuities reporting unit, which required a Step 2 analysis to be completed. In our Step 2 analysis, we estimated the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill as determined by allocating the reporting unit’s fair value determined in Step 1 to all of its net assets (recognized and unrecognized) as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination at the date of the impairment test.   Based upon our Step 2 analysis, we recorded a goodwill impairment of $600 million for the Retirement Solutions – Annuities reporting unit, which was attributable primarily to higher discount rates related to higher debt costs and equity market volatility, deterioration in equity markets and lower annuity sales.   Adoption of FSP FAS No. 115-2 and 124-2 – Recognition and Presentation of Other-Than-Temporary-Impairments   We adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board Staff Position (“FSP”) FAS No. 115-2 and 124-2, “Recognition and Presentation of Other-Than-Temporary-Impairments” (“FSP FAS 115-2”) for our debt securities effective January 1, 2009. The adoption of FSP FAS 115-2 required that an OTTI loss be separated into the amount representing the decrease in cash flows expected to be collected (“credit loss”), which is recognized in earnings, and the amount related to all other factors (“noncredit loss”), which is recognized in other comprehensive income (“OCI”). In addition, FSP FAS 115-2 replaces the requirement for management to assert that it has the intent and ability to hold an impaired security until recovery with the requirement that management assert that it does not have the intent to sell the security and that it is more likely than not that it will not have to sell the security before recovery of its cost basis.   We regularly review our AFS securities for declines in fair value that we determine to be other-than-temporary. In accordance with FSP FAS 115-2, if we intend to sell a security and the market value of the security is below amortized cost, the amortized cost is written down to current fair value with a corresponding charge to realized loss on our Consolidated Statements of Income, as this is deemed a credit-related event. If we do not intend to sell a security but believe we will not recover a security’s amortized cost, the amortized cost is written down to the estimated recovery value with a corresponding charge to realized loss on our Consolidated Statements of Income, as this is also deemed a credit-related event, and the remainder of the decline to fair value is recorded to unrealized OTTI loss on AFS securities on our Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Equity, as this is considered a noncredit (i.e., recoverable) event. The determination of our intent to sell a security is based upon whether we can assert that we do not have the intent to sell the security and if it is more likely than not that we will not have to sell the security before recovery of the securities cost basis. In making this determination, we evaluate facts and circumstances such as, but not limited to, decisions to reposition our security portfolio, sale of securities to meet cash flow needs and sales of securities to capitalize on favorable pricing. The credit loss on a security is based upon our estimate of the decrease in expected cash flows or our best estimate of credit deterioration. If an OTTI exists and we do not have sufficient cash flow or other information to determine a recovery value for the security, we would conclude that the entire OTTI is credit-related and the amortized cost for the security is written down to current fair value with a corresponding charge to realized loss on our Consolidated Statements of Income.         54       As a result of the adoption, we recorded a cumulative effect adjustment, resulting in an increase of $102 million to our opening balance of retained earnings with a corresponding decrease to accumulated OCI, to reclassify the noncredit portion of previously other-than-temporarily impaired debt securities. In addition, the amortized cost basis of debt securities for which a noncredit OTTI loss was previously recognized was increased by $199 million, or the amount of the cumulative effect adjustment, pre-DAC, VOBA, DSI, DFEL and tax. The fair value of our debt securities did not change as a result of the adoption.   We recognized an OTTI loss of $139 million for the three months ended March 31, 2009, of which $81 million was recognized in net income on our Consolidated Statements of Income related to credit losses and $58 million was recognized in OCI on our Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Equity related to noncredit losses. For additional details, see “Investments” below and Notes 2 and 5.   Adoption of FSP FAS No. 157-4 – Determining Fair Value When the Volume and Level of Activity for the Asset or Liability Have Significantly Decreased and Identifying Transactions That Are Not Orderly   We adopted FSP FAS No. 157-4, “Determining Fair Value When the Volume and Level of Activity for the Asset or Liability Have Significantly Decreased and Identifying Transactions That Are Not Orderly” (“FSP FAS 157-4”), effective January 1, 2009. FSP FAS 157-4 provides additional guidance on estimating fair value when the volume and level of activity for an asset or liability have significantly decreased in relation to normal market activity for the asset or liability and additional guidance on circumstances that may indicate that a transaction is not orderly.   FSP FAS 157-4 does not change the objective of a fair value measurement. That is, even when there has been a significant decrease in market activity for a security, the fair value objective remains the same. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell the security in an orderly transaction (i.e., not a forced liquidation or distressed sale), between market participants at the measurement date in the current inactive market (i.e., an “exit price” notion).   FSP FAS 157-4 provides additional guidance on estimating fair value when the volume and level of activity for an asset or liability have significantly decreased in relation to normal market activity for the asset or liability. The FSP also provides additional guidance on circumstances that may indicate that a transaction is not orderly. Specifically, the FSP provides factors that indicate that a market is not active, including:       ·  Few recent transactions based on volume and level of activity in the market, therefore there is not sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis;     ·  Price quotations are not based on current information;     ·  Price quotations vary substantially either over time or among market makers;     ·  Indexes that previously were highly correlated with the fair values of the asset are demonstrably uncorrelated with recent fair values;     ·  Abnormal, or significant increases in, liquidity risk premiums or implied yields for quoted prices when compared with reasonable estimates using realistic assumptions of credit and other nonperformance risk for the asset class;     ·  Abnormally wide bid-ask spread or significant increases in the bid-ask spread; and     ·  Little information is released publicly.   After evaluating all factors and considering the significance and relevance of each factor, the reporting entity shall use its judgment in determining whether there has been a significant decrease in the volume and level of activity for the asset when the market for that asset is not active. The factors should be considered in relation to the normal market activity for the asset.   When the market for an asset or liability has exhibited a significant decrease in transaction volume when compared to normal market activity for the asset or liability (or similar assets and liabilities), additional analysis is required to ascertain whether or not observed transactions or quoted prices are reflective of fair values. When there has been a significant decline in activity and a market is no longer active, the use of multiple valuation techniques (or a change in valuation technique) may be appropriate. The circumstances that may indicate a transaction is not orderly could include:       ·  The seller is in or near bankruptcy or receivership or the seller was required to sell the asset to meet regulatory requirements;     ·  There was a usual and customary marketing period, but the seller marketed the asset to a single market participant; and     ·  The transaction price is significantly different relative to other similar transactions.   Transactions that are deemed not orderly would not be determinative of fair value or of market participant risk premiums. In estimating fair value, an entity should place more weight on transactions that it concludes are orderly. Less weight should be placed on transactions that the reporting entity does not have sufficient information to conclude whether the transaction is orderly.       55       As of March 31, 2009, we evaluated the markets that our securities trade in and concluded that none were inactive. We will continue to re-evaluate this conclusion, as needed, based on market conditions.   Derivatives   To protect us from a variety of equity market and interest rate risks that are inherent in many of our life insurance and annuity products, we use various derivative instruments. Assessing the effectiveness of these hedging programs and evaluating the carrying values of the related derivatives often involve a variety of assumptions and estimates. We use derivatives to hedge equity market risks, interest rate risk and foreign currency exposures that are embedded in our annuity and life insurance product liabilities or investment portfolios. Derivatives held as of March 31, 2009, contain industry standard terms. Our accounting policies for derivatives and the potential impact on interest spreads in a falling rate environment are discussed in “Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” and Note 6 of this report and “Part II – Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” and Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2008 Form 10-K.   Guaranteed Living Benefits   We have a dynamic hedging strategy designed to mitigate selected risk and income statement volatility caused by changes in the equity markets, interest rates and market implied volatilities associated with the Lincoln SmartSecurity® Advantage guaranteed withdrawal benefit (“GWB”) feature and our i4LIFE® Advantage and 4LATER® Advantage guaranteed income benefit (“GIB”) features that are available in our variable annuity products. In early January 2008, we added the GLB features that are available in our variable annuity products in our New York insurance subsidiary, LLANY, to our hedge program. In February 2008, we also added our new GWB Lincoln Lifetime IncomeSM Advantage to our hedging program. Our GIB and 4LATER® features have elements of both insurance benefits accounted for under SOP 03-1 and embedded derivatives accounted for under SFAS 133 and SFAS 157. We weight these features and their associated reserves accordingly based on their hybrid nature. In addition to mitigating selected risk and income statement volatility, the hedge program is also focused on a long-term goal of accumulating assets that could be used to pay claims under these benefits, recognizing that such claims are likely to begin no earlier than approximately a decade in the future.   The hedging strategy is designed such that changes in the value of the hedge contracts move in the opposite direction of changes in the value of the embedded derivative portion of the GLB features. This dynamic hedging strategy utilizes options on U.S.-based equity indices, futures on U.S.-based and international equity indices and variance swaps on U.S.-based equity indices, as well as interest rate futures and swaps. The notional amounts of the underlying hedge instruments are such that the magnitude of the change in the value of the hedge instruments due to changes in equity markets, interest rates and implied volatilities is designed to offset the magnitude of the change in the fair value of the GLB guarantees caused by those same factors. As of March 31, 2009, the fair value of the embedded derivative liability, before adjustment for the NPR factor required by SFAS 157, for GWB, the i4LIFE® Advantage GIB and the 4LATER® Advantage GIB were valued at $2.3 billion, $709 million and $201 million, respectively. See “Realized Loss – Operating Realized Gain – GLB” for information on how we determine our NPR.   As part of our current hedging program, equity market, interest rate and market implied volatility conditions are monitored on a daily basis. We rebalance our hedge positions based upon changes in these factors as needed. While we actively manage our hedge positions, our hedge positions may not be totally effective to offset changes in the fair value embedded derivative liability caused by movements in these factors due to, among other things, differences in timing between when a market exposure changes and corresponding changes to the hedge positions, extreme swings in the equity markets, interest rates and market implied volatilities, realized market volatility, contract holder behavior, divergence between the performance of the underlying funds and the hedging indices, divergence between the actual and expected performance of the hedge instruments or our ability to purchase hedging instruments at prices consistent with our desired risk and return trade-off. This hedging strategy is managed on a combined basis with the hedge for our GDB features.   For more information on our GDB hedging strategy, see the discussion in “Future Contract Benefits and Other Contract Holder Obligations” below.   As of March 31, 2009, the fair value of our derivative assets, which hedge both our GLB and GDB features, and including margins generated by futures contracts, was $3.7 billion. As of March 31, 2009, the sum of all GLB liabilities at fair value and GDB reserves was $3.5 billion, comprised of $3.2 billion for GLB liabilities and $0.3 billion for the GDB reserves. The fair value of the hedge assets exceeded the liabilities by $0.2 billion, which we believe indicates that the hedge strategy has performed well by providing funding for our best estimate of the present value of the liabilities related to our GLB and GDB features. However, the relationship of hedge assets to the liabilities for the guarantees may vary in any given reporting period due to market conditions, hedge performance and/or changes to the hedging strategy.          56       Approximately 35% of our variable annuity account values contain a GWB rider. Declines in the equity markets increase our exposure to potential benefits under the GWB contracts, leading to an increase in our existing liability for those benefits. For example, a GWB contract is “in the money” if the contract holder’s account balance falls below the guaranteed amount. As of March 31, 2009, and March 31, 2008, 68% and 44%, respectively, of all GWB in-force contracts were “in the money,” and our exposure to the guaranteed amounts, after reinsurance, as of March 31, 2009, and March 31, 2008, was $5.7 billion and $705 million respectively. Our exposure before reinsurance for these same periods was $6.4 billion and $816 million, respectively. However, the only way the GWB contract holder can monetize the excess of the guaranteed amount over the account value of the contract is upon death or through a series of withdrawals that do not exceed a specific percentage per year of the guaranteed amount. If, after the series of withdrawals, the account value is exhausted, the contract holder will receive a series of annuity payments equal to the remaining guaranteed amount, and, for our lifetime GWB products, the annuity payments can continue beyond the guaranteed amount. The account value can also fluctuate with equity market returns on a daily basis resulting in increases or decreases in the excess of the guaranteed amount over account value.   As a result of these factors, the ultimate amount to be paid by us related to GWB guarantees is uncertain and could be significantly more or less than $5.7 billion, net of reinsurance. Our fair value estimates of the GWB liabilities, which are based on detailed models of future cash flows under a wide range of market-consistent scenarios, reflect a more comprehensive view of the related factors and represent our best estimate of the present value of these potential liabilities.   For information on our GLB hedging results, see our discussion in “Realized Loss” below.   Income Taxes   The application of GAAP requires us to evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax assets and establish a valuation allowance, if necessary, to reduce our deferred tax asset to an amount that is more likely than not to be realizable. Considerable judgment and the use of estimates are required in determining whether a valuation allowance is necessary, and if so, the amount of such valuation allowance. In evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, we consider many factors, including: the nature and character of the deferred tax assets and liabilities; taxable income in prior carryback years; projected taxable earnings, including capital gains exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards; the length of time carryovers can be utilized; and any tax planning strategies we would employ to avoid a tax benefit from expiring unused. Although realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets, including our capital loss deferred tax asset, will be realized. For additional information on our income taxes, see Note 7 in this report and Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2008 Form 10-K.   Acquisitions and Dispositions   For information about acquisitions and divestitures, see Note 3 in this report and “Part I – Item 1. Business – Acquisitions and Dispositions” and Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2008 Form 10-K.         57              RESULTS OF CONSOLIDATED OPERATIONS   Net Income (Loss)   Details underlying the consolidated results and assets under management (in millions) were as follows:           For the Three              Months Ended              March 31,              2009      2008      Change    Revenues                    Insurance premiums   $ 518     $ 509       2 %  Insurance fees     728       814       -11 %  Investment advisory fees     44       76       -42 %  Net investment income     1,027       1,065       -4 %  Realized loss:                          Total other-than-temporary impairment                          losses on securities     (214 )     (57 )    NM    Portion of loss recognized in other                          comprehensive income     89       -

The decrease in net income was partially offset by the following:      ·  Lower DAC and VOBA amortization, net of interest and excluding unlocking, and lower asset-based expenses due primarily to declines in variable account values from unfavorable equity markets during the first quarter of 2009;     ·  A $42 million gain associated with the early extinguishment of long-term debt;     ·  A reduction in federal income tax expense due primarily to favorable tax return true-ups driven by the separate account DRD, foreign tax credit adjustments and other items;     ·  Lower broker-dealer expenses due primarily to lower sales of non-proprietary products, lower merger expenses as many of our integration efforts related to our acquisition of Jefferson-Pilot have been completed, lower incentive compensation accruals as a result of lower earnings and production performance relative to planned goals and the implementation of several expense management controls and practices that are focused on expense reduction initiatives; and     ·  The $16 million impact of the initial adoption of SFAS 157 on January 1, 2008.

The Retirement Solutions – Annuities segment provides tax-deferred investment growth and lifetime income opportunities for its clients by offering individual fixed annuities, including indexed annuities, and variable annuities. The Retirement Solutions – Defined Contribution segment provides employer-sponsored variable and fixed annuities and mutual-fund based programs in the 401(k), 403(b) and 457 marketplaces.   Retirement Solutions – Annuities   Income from Operations   Details underlying the results for Retirement Solutions – Annuities (in millions) were as follows:           For the Three              Months Ended              March 31,              2009      2008      Change    Operating Revenues                    Insurance premiums   $ 27     $ 32       -16 %  Insurance fees     181       246       -26 %  Net investment income     240       248       -3 %  Operating realized gain     90       10      NM    Other revenues and fees (1)     61       87       -30 %  Total operating revenues     599       623       -4 %  Operating Expenses                          Interest credited     161       163       -1 %  Benefits     169       51       231 %  Underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other                           expenses     206       252       -18 %  Total operating expenses     536       466       15 %  Income from operations before taxes     63       157       -60 %  Federal income tax expense (benefit)     (11 )     39      NM    Income from operations   $ 74     $ 118       -37 %         (1)  Other revenues and fees consists primarily of broker-dealer earnings that are subject to market volatility.   Comparison of the Three Months Ended March 31, 2009 to 2008   Income from operations for this segment decreased due primarily to the following:          ·  Lower insurance fees driven primarily by lower average daily variable account values due to unfavorable equity markets, partially offset by increased higher average expense assessment rates due to continued growth in rider elections that have incremental charges associated with them;        ·  Higher benefits from an increase in the change in GDB reserves due to an increase in our expected GDB benefit payments attributable primarily to the decline in account values below guaranteed levels due to the unfavorable equity markets;        ·  A $7 million unfavorable retrospective unlocking of DAC, VOBA, DSI, DFEL and reserves for our guarantee riders in the first quarter of 2009 due primarily to higher lapses, higher death benefit costs and the impact of lower equity market performance than our model projections assumed;        ·  Lower net investment income attributable primarily to higher cash balances related to our short-term liquidity strategy during the recent volatile markets that has reduced our portfolio yield by 54 basis points; and        ·  A less favorable net broker-dealer margin attributable primarily to lower sales of non-proprietary products and lower earnings due to the unfavorable equity markets.         62       The decrease in income from operations was partially offset by the following:       ·  A reduction in federal income tax expense due primarily to favorable tax return true-ups driven by the separate account DRD, foreign tax credit adjustments and other items; and     ·  Lower underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses, excluding unlocking, due primarily to lower DAC and VOBA amortization, net of interest, and lower asset-based expenses driven by the declines in our variable account values from unfavorable equity markets, lower incentive compensation accruals as a result of lower earnings and production performance relative to planned goals and the implementation of several expense management controls and practices that are focused on expense reduction initiatives.   Future Expectations   We expect lower earnings for this segment over the remainder of 2009 than we experienced in 2008, when excluding the impact of unlocking. The expected decline is attributable to the following:       ·  Lower expense assessments and higher changes in reserves related to our GDB features, partially offset by lower asset-based expenses, due to the variable account value erosion from unfavorable equity market returns experienced during the fourth quarter of 2008 and continuing in the first quarter of 2009 resulting in lower account values;     ·  Lower investment income on the segment’s alternative investments due to the market conditions in both the equity and credit markets (see “Consolidated Investments – Alternative Investments” below for additional information on our alternative investments) and lower yields from the impact of holding higher levels of cash, which we plan to reduce as we progress through 2009, during the recent volatile markets as part of our short-term liquidity strategy; and     ·  Higher expenses attributable to our U.S. pension plans (see “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans” in our 2008 Form 10-K for additional information).   Although the segment’s results in the first quarter of 2009 were unfavorably impacted by declining account values and the economic environment, its overall net flows were relatively strong in a challenging economic environment. New deposits are an important component of net flows and key to our efforts to grow our business. Although deposits do not significantly impact current period income from operations, they are an important indicator of future profitability.   The other component of net flows relates to the retention of the business. An important measure of retention is the lapse rate, which compares the amount of withdrawals to the average account values. The overall lapse rate for our annuity products was 10% for the first quarter of 2009 compared to 8% for the corresponding period in 2008. Although lapse rates have risen due primarily to the challenging economic environment, the overall increase is relatively moderate and still falls within pricing parameters.   See Note 9 above for information on contractual guarantees to contract holders related to GDB features.   We expect to manage the effect of changing market investment returns by managing interest rate spreads for near-term income from operations through a combination of crediting rate actions and portfolio management. Our expectation includes the assumption that there are no significant changes in net flows in or out of our fixed accounts or other changes that may cause interest rate spreads to differ from our expectation.   Our fixed annuity business includes products with crediting rates that are reset on an annual basis and are not subject to surrender charges. Account values for these products, including the fixed portion of variable, were $7.2 billion as of March 31, 2009, with 63% already at their minimum guaranteed rates. The average crediting rates for these products were approximately 35 basis points in excess of average minimum guaranteed rates. Our ability to retain annual reset annuities will be subject to current competitive conditions at the time interest rates for these products reset.

These assessments are a function of the rates priced into the product and the average daily variable account values. Average daily account values are driven by net flows and the equity markets. In addition, for our fixed annuity contracts and for some variable contracts, we collect surrender charges when contract holders surrender their contracts during their surrender charge periods to protect us from premature withdrawals. Insurance fees include charges on both our variable and fixed annuity products, but exclude the attributed fees on our GLB products; see “Realized Gain (Loss) – Operating Realized Gain – GLB” below for discussion of these attributed fees.         65       Net Investment Income and Interest Credited   Details underlying net investment income, interest credited (in millions) and our interest rate spread were as follows:            For the Three              Months Ended              March 31,              2009      2008      Change    Net Investment Income                    Fixed maturity securities, mortgage loans on real                    estate and other, net of investment expenses   $ 224     $ 228       -2 %  Commercial mortgage loan prepayment and bond  makewhole premiums (1)     -       1       -100 %  Alternative investments (2)     (1 )     -      NM    Surplus investments (3)     17       18       -6 %  Broker-dealer     -       1       -100 %  Total net investment income   $ 240     $ 248       -3 %                            Interest Credited                          Amount provided to contract holders   $ 172     $ 183       -6 %  DSI deferrals     (16 )     (26 )     38 %  Interest credited before DSI amortization     156       157       -1 %  DSI amortization:                          Retrospective unlocking     6       (1 )    NM    Amortization, excluding unlocking     (1 )     7      NM    Total interest credited   $ 161     $ 163       -1 %       (1)  See “Consolidated Investments – Commercial Mortgage Loan Prepayment and Bond Makewhole Premiums” below for additional information.

We expect to earn a spread between what we earn on the underlying general account investments supporting the fixed annuity product line, including the fixed portion of variable annuity contracts, and what we credit to our fixed annuity contract holders’ accounts, including the fixed portion of variable annuity contracts. The interest rate spread for this segment represents the excess of the yield on invested assets on reserves over the average crediting rate. The yield on invested assets on reserves is calculated as net investment income, excluding the amounts attributable to our surplus investments, reverse repurchase agreement interest expense, inter-segment cash management program interest expense and interest on collateral divided by average invested assets on reserves. The average invested assets on reserves is calculated based upon total invested assets, excluding hedge derivatives and collateral. The average crediting rate is calculated as interest credited before DSI amortization, plus the immediate annuity reserve change (included within benefits) divided by the average fixed account values, including the fixed portion of variable annuity contracts, net of coinsured account values. Fixed account values reinsured under modified coinsurance agreements are included in account values for this calculation. Changes in commercial mortgage loan prepayments and bond makewhole premiums, investment income on alternative investments and surplus investment income can vary significantly from period to period due to a number of factors and, therefore, may contribute to investment income results that are not indicative of the underlying trends.   Benefits   Benefits for this segment include changes in reserves on immediate annuity account values driven by premiums, death benefits paid and changes in reserves on GDBs.   The changes in reserves attributable to the segment’s benefit ratio unlocking of its SOP 03-1 reserves for GDB riders is offset in operating realized gain.

We have certain trail commissions that are based upon account values that are expensed as incurred rather than deferred and amortized.   Broker-dealer expenses that vary with and are related to sales are expensed as incurred and not deferred and amortized. Fluctuations in these expenses correspond with fluctuations in other revenues and fees.         68       Retirement Solutions – Defined Contribution   Income from Operations   Details underlying the results for Retirement Solutions – Defined Contribution (in millions) were as follows:           For the Three              Months Ended              March 31,              2009      2008      Change    Operating Revenues                    Insurance fees   $ 41     $ 61       -33 %  Net investment income     175       172       2 %  Operating realized gain     7       -      NM    Other revenues and fees     2       5       -60 %  Total operating revenues     225       238       -5 %  Operating Expenses                          Interest credited     111       106       5 %  Benefits     6       -      NM    Underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other                          expenses     71       77       -8 %  Total operating expenses     188       183       3 %  Income from operations before taxes     37       55       -33 %  Federal income tax expense     7       15       -53 %  Income from operations   $ 30     $ 40       -25 %   Comparison of the Three Months Ended March 31, 2009 to 2008   Income from operations for this segment decreased due primarily to the following:          ·  Lower insurance fees driven primarily by lower average daily variable account values resulting from the unfavorable equity markets and an overall shift in business mix toward products with lower expense assessment rates;        ·  Higher benefits from an increase in the change in GDB reserves due to an increase in our expected GDB benefit payments attributable primarily to the decline in account values due to the unfavorable equity markets; and        ·  Higher interest credited driven primarily by higher average fixed account values, including the fixed portion of variable annuity contracts, driven by transfers from variable to fixed.   The decrease in income from operations was partially offset by the following:          ·  A reduction in federal income tax expense due primarily to favorable tax return true-ups driven by the separate account DRD, foreign tax credit adjustments and other items;        ·  Lower underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses, excluding unlocking, due primarily to lower DAC and VOBA amortization, net of interest, driven by the declines in our variable account values from unfavorable equity markets, and the implementation of several expense management controls and practices that are focused on expense reduction initiatives; and        ·  Higher net investment income driven primarily by higher average fixed account values, including the fixed portion of variable annuity contracts, driven by transfers from variable to fixed, partially offset by our liquidity strategy of maintaining higher cash balances during the recent volatile markets that has reduced our portfolio yield by 16 basis points.         69       Future Expectations   We expect lower earnings for this segment in 2009 than we experienced in 2008, when excluding the impacts of unlocking. The expected decline is attributable to the following:       ·  Lower expense assessments and higher changes in reserves related to our GDB features, partially offset by lower asset-based expenses, due to the variable account value erosion from unfavorable equity market returns experienced during the fourth quarter of 2008 and continuing in the first quarter of 2009 resulting in lower account values;     ·  Lower investment income on the segment’s alternative investments due to the market conditions in both the equity and credit markets (see “Consolidated Investments – Alternative Investments” below for additional information on our alternative investments) and lower yields from the impact of holding higher levels of cash, which we plan to reduce as we progress through 2009, during the recent volatile markets as part of our short-term liquidity strategy;     ·  Lower insurance fees driven by a continuing overall shift in business mix toward products with lower expense assessments and lower margins; and     ·  Higher expenses attributable to our U.S. pension plans (see “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans” in our 2008 Form 10-K for additional information).   Although the segment’s results in the first quarter of 2009 were unfavorably impacted by declining account values and the economic environment, its overall net flows were strong in a challenging economic environment.   New deposits are an important component of net flows and key to our efforts to grow our business. Although deposits do not significantly impact current period income from operations, they are an important indicator of future profitability.   The other component of net flows relates to the retention of the business. An important measure of retention is the lapse rate, which compares the amount of withdrawals to the average account values. The overall lapse rate for our annuity products was 12% for the first quarter of 2009 compared to 16% for the corresponding period in 2008.   Due to an expected overall shift in business mix towards products with lower expense assessment rates, a substantial increase in new deposit production will be necessary to maintain earnings at current levels.   See Note 9 above for information on contractual guarantees to contract holders related to GDB features.   We expect to manage the effect of changing market investment returns by managing interest rate spreads for near-term income from operations through a combination of crediting rate actions and portfolio management. Our expectation includes the assumption that there are no significant changes in net flows in or out of our fixed accounts or other changes that may cause interest rate spreads to differ from our expectation.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.”   For factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in this section, see “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2008 Form 10-K, as updated in “Part II – Item 1A. Risk Factors” below, and “Forward-Looking Statements – Cautionary Language” in this report.

Expense assessments are generally equal to a percentage of the daily variable account values. Average daily account values are driven by net flows and the equity markets. Our expense assessments include fees we earn for the services that we provide to our mutual fund programs. In addition, for both our fixed and variable annuity contracts, we collect surrender charges when contract holders surrender their contracts during the surrender charge periods to protect us from premature withdrawals.       72       Net Investment Income and Interest Credited   Details underlying net investment income, interest credited (in millions) and our interest rate spread were as follows:            For the Three              Months Ended              March 31,              2009      2008      Change    Net Investment Income                    Fixed maturity securities, mortgage loans on real                    estate and other, net of investment expenses   $ 165     $ 162       2 %  Alternative investments (1)     -       (1 )     100 %  Surplus investments (2)     10       11       -9 %  Total net investment income   $ 175     $ 172       2 %                            Interest Credited   $ 111     $ 106       5 %       (1)  See “Consolidated Investments – Alternative Investments” below for additional information.

We expect to earn a spread between what we earn on the underlying general account investments supporting the fixed annuity product line, including the fixed portion of variable annuity contracts, and what we credit to our fixed annuity contract holders’ accounts, including the fixed portion of variable annuity contracts. The interest rate spread for this segment represents the excess of the yield on invested assets on reserves over the average crediting rate. The yield on invested assets on reserves is calculated as net investment income, excluding the amounts attributable to our surplus investments, reverse repurchase agreement interest expense, inter-segment cash management program interest expense and interest on collateral, divided by average invested assets on reserves. The average invested assets on reserves are calculated based upon total invested assets, excluding hedge derivatives. The average crediting rate is calculated as interest credited before DSI amortization, divided by the average fixed account values, including the fixed portion of variable annuity contracts. Commercial mortgage loan prepayments and bond makewhole premiums, investment income on alternative investments and surplus investment income can vary significantly from period to period due to a number of factors and, therefore, may contribute to investment income results that are not indicative of the underlying trends.   Benefits   Benefits for this segment include changes in reserves on GDBs and death benefits paid.   The changes in reserves attributable to the segment’s benefit ratio unlocking of its SOP 03-1 reserves for GDB riders is offset in operating realized gain. See “Realized Gain (Loss) – Operating Realized Gain – GDB” below for additional information.

For certain annuity contracts, trail commissions that are based upon account values are expensed as incurred rather than deferred and amortized. We do not pay commissions on sales of our mutual fund products, and distribution expenses associated with the sale of these mutual fund products are not deferred and amortized.         74       RESULTS OF INSURANCE SOLUTIONS   The Insurance Solutions business provides its products through two segments: Life Insurance and Group Protection. The Insurance Solutions – Life Insurance segment offers wealth protection and transfer opportunities through term insurance, a linked-benefit product (which is a UL policy linked with riders that provide for long-term care costs) and both single and survivorship versions of UL and VUL, including corporate-owned UL and VUL (“COLI”) and bank-owned UL and VUL (“BOLI”) products. The Insurance Solutions – Group Protection segment offers group life, disability and dental insurance to employers.   For factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in this section, see “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2008 Form 10-K, as updated in “Part II – Item 1A. Risk Factors” below, and “Forward-Looking Statements – Cautionary Language” in this report.   Insurance Solutions – Life Insurance   Income from Operations   Details underlying the results for Insurance Solutions – Life Insurance (in millions) were as follows:           For the Three              Months Ended              March 31,              2009      2008      Change    Operating Revenues                    Insurance premiums   $ 91     $ 87       5 %  Insurance fees     482       460       5 %  Net investment income     498       499       0 %  Other revenues and fees     5       9       -44 %  Total operating revenues     1,076       1,055       2 %  Operating Expenses                          Interest credited     303       297       2 %  Benefits     356       300       19 %  Underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other                           expenses     224       219       2 %  Total operating expenses     883       816       8 %  Income from operations before taxes     193       239       -19 %  Federal income tax expense     51       82       -38 %  Income from operations   $ 142     $ 157       -10 %   Comparison of the Three Months Ended March 31, 2009 to 2008   Income from operations for this segment decreased due primarily to an increase in benefits attributable primarily to an increase in reserves for products with secondary guarantees from continued growth of business in force and higher mortality due to an increase in the average attained age of the in-force block (discussed in “Future Expectations” below).   The decrease in income from operations was partially offset by the following:       ·  Growth in insurance fees driven by an increase in business in force as a result of new sales and favorable persistency and an increase in the average attained age of the in-force block (discussed in “Future Expectations” below); and     ·  A reduction in federal income tax expense due primarily to favorable tax return true-ups.         75       Future Expectations   The coinsurance agreement that we entered into on March 31, 2009, resulted in a pre-tax deferred loss of $53 million, and approximately $2 million annually will be amortized into income from operations prospectively over 20 years. As a result of this agreement, we expect this segment’s income from operations will be reduced by approximately $7 million per quarter and will result in reductions in insurance fees, net investment income, interest credited and benefits. We expect this impact to income from operations will be partially offset by a $2 million increase in Other Operations as it will have higher net investment income due to the transfer of assets from the reduction in capital as a result of this coinsurance agreement; therefore, the net impact from this transaction to our consolidated income from operations will be a reduction of $5 million per quarter. See “Reinsurance” below for more information.   As of December 31, 2008, we released approximately $240 million of capital that had previously supported our UL products with secondary guarantees as a result of executing on a reinsurance transaction to release statutory reserves related to the Application of the Valuation of Life Insurance Policies Model Regulation (“AG38”). This reduction in capital lowered the level of assets supporting this business, as assets were transferred to Other Operations, which reduced net investment income by approximately $4 million in the first quarter of 2009 that will also recur in future quarters.   A portion of the retrospective and prospective unlocking of DAC, VOBA, DFEL and secondary guarantee life insurance product reserves in 2008 resulted in an unfavorable recurring earnings impact of $7 million per quarter that began in the third quarter of 2008.   On June 1, 2008, we implemented a 10 basis point decrease in crediting rates on most interest-sensitive products not already at contractual guarantees, which has increased spreads by approximately 5 basis points. On March 1, 2009, we implemented a 15 basis point decrease in crediting rates on most interest-sensitive products not already at contractual guarantees, which is expected to increase future spreads by approximately 5 basis points.   During the recent volatile markets, we maintained higher cash balances as part of our short-term liquidity strategy that has reduced our portfolio yield by 11 basis points. We expect lower yields from the impact of holding higher levels of cash, which we plan to reduce as we progress through 2009. As of March 31, 2009, 72% of interest-sensitive account values had crediting rates at contract guaranteed levels, and 15% had crediting rates within 50 basis points of contractual guarantees. Going forward, we expect to be able to manage the effects of spreads on near-term income from operations through a combination of rate actions and portfolio management, which assumes no significant changes in net flows into or out of our fixed accounts or other changes that may cause interest rate spreads to differ from our expectations. For information on interest rate spreads and the interest rate risk due to falling interest rates, see “Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.”   Despite the challenging economic environment, we believe that our new business products, as represented by sales, deposits and in-force face amount, were relatively strong.   Sales are not recorded as a component of revenues (other than for traditional products) and do not have a significant impact on current quarter income from operations but are indicators of future profitability. Generally, we have higher sales during the second half of the year with the fourth quarter being our strongest; however, results for 2008 were muted given the economic conditions. The average issue age on new policies has increased in recent years as a result of targeting higher net worth individuals, which has increased the average attained age of the in-force block. We have screening procedures to identify sales that we believe have characteristics associated with stranger-originated life insurance, which typically involve the use of premium financing, face amount in excess of $2 million and older aged individuals, in order to prevent policies with these characteristics from being issued. With stranger-originated arrangements, a third-party investor with no relationship to an individual initiates the purchase of a policy by paying the premiums and later buying the policy, thereby profiting upon the death of the insured. However, accurate identification of these policies can be difficult, and we continue to modify our screening procedures. We believe that our sales of UL products include some sales with stranger-originated life insurance characteristics. We expect no significant impact to our profitability; however, returns on UL business sold as part of stranger-originated designs are believed to be lower than traditional estate planning UL sales due in part to no expected lapses.   We expect higher expenses attributable to our U.S. pension plans (see “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans” in our 2008 Form 10-K) during 2009.   We provide information about this segment’s operating revenue and operating expense line items, the period in which amounts are recognized, key drivers of changes and historical details underlying the line items and their associated drivers below.         76       Insurance Premiums   Insurance premiums relate to traditional products and are a function of the rates priced into the product and the level of insurance in force. Insurance in force, in turn, is driven by sales, persistency and mortality experience.   Insurance Fees   Details underlying insurance fees, sales, net flows, account values and in-force face amount (in millions) were as follows:                                For the Three              Months Ended              March 31,              2009      2008      Change    Insurance Fees                    Mortality assessments   $ 344     $ 322       7 %  Expense assessments     178       170       5 %  Surrender charges     22       17       29 %  DFEL:                          Deferrals     (97 )     (89 )     -9 %  Amortization, net of interest:                          Retrospective unlocking     3       4       -25 %  Amortization, net of interest, excluding                          unlocking     32       36       -11 %  Total insurance fees   $ 482     $ 460       5 %             For the Three              Months Ended              March 31,              2009      2008      Change    Sales by Product                    UL:                    Excluding MoneyGuard®   $ 103     $ 114       -10 %  MoneyGuard®     11       11       0 %  Total UL     114       125       -9 %  VUL     9       16       -44 %  COLI and BOLI     12       28       -57 %  Term/whole life     10       5       100 %  Total sales   $ 145     $ 174       -17 %                            Net Flows                          Deposits   $ 1,058     $ 1,132       -7 %  Withdrawals and deaths     (501 )     (481 )     -4 %  Net flows   $ 557     $ 651       -14 %                            Contract holder assessments   $ 725     $ 663       9 %         77                 As of March 31,              2009      2008      Change    Account Values                    UL (1)   $ 24,388     $ 24,450       0 %  VUL (1)     3,352       5,615       -40 %  Interest-sensitive whole life     2,291       2,276       1 %  Total account values   $ 30,031     $ 32,341       -7 %                            In-Force Face Amount                          UL and other (1)   $ 288,826     $ 302,013       -4 %  Term insurance     236,408       234,860       1 %  Total in-force face amount   $ 525,234     $ 536,873       -2 %       (1)  Effective March 31, 2009, UL and VUL account values were reduced by $938 million and $640 million, respectively, and UL and other face amount in force was reduced by $20.9 billion as a result of the coinsurance agreement with Commonwealth.   Insurance fees relate only to interest-sensitive products and include mortality assessments, expense assessments (net of deferrals and amortization related to DFEL) and surrender charges. Mortality and expense assessments are deducted from our contract holders’ account values. These amounts are a function of the rates priced into the product and premiums received, face amount in force and account values. Insurance in force, in turn, is driven by sales, persistency and mortality experience. In-force growth should be considered independently with respect to term products versus UL and other products, as term products have a lower profitability relative to face amount compared to whole life and interest-sensitive products.   Sales in the table above and as discussed above were reported as follows:          ·  UL (excluding linked-benefit products) and VUL (including COLI and BOLI) – first year commissionable premiums plus 5% of excess premiums received, including an adjustment for internal replacements of approximately 50% of commissionable premiums;        ·  MoneyGuard® (our linked-benefit product) – 15% of premium deposits; and        ·  Whole life and term – 100% of first year paid premiums.   UL and VUL products with secondary guarantees represented approximately 37% of interest-sensitive life insurance in force as of March 31, 2009, and approximately 73% of sales for the first three months of 2009. AG38 imposes additional statutory reserve requirements for these products.         78       Net Investment Income and Interest Credited   Details underlying net investment income, interest credited (in millions) and our interest rate spread were as follows:            For the Three              Months Ended              March 31,              2009      2008      Change    Net Investment Income                    Fixed maturity securities, mortgage loans on real                    estate and other, net of investment expenses   $ 481     $ 474       1 %  Commercial mortgage loan prepayment and                          bond makewhole premiums (1)     -       3       -100 %  Alternative investments (2)     (4 )     -      NM    Surplus investments (3)     21       22       -5 %  Total net investment income   $ 498     $ 499       0 %                            Interest Credited   $ 303     $ 297       2 %       (1)  See “Consolidated Investments – Commercial Mortgage Loan Prepayment and Bond Makewhole Premiums” below for additional information.

A portion of the investment income earned for this segment is credited to contract holder accounts. Invested assets will typically grow at a faster rate than account values because of the AG38 reserve requirements, which cause statutory reserves to grow at an accelerated rate. Invested assets are based upon the statutory reserve liabilities and are therefore affected by various reserve adjustments, primarily the result of the merger of several of our insurance subsidiaries, the modification of accounting for certain of our life insurance policies, and by capital transactions providing relief from AG38 reserve requirements, which leads to a transfer of invested assets from this segment to Other Operations for use in other corporate purposes. We expect to earn a spread between what we earn on the underlying general account investments and what we credit to our contract holders’ accounts. The interest rate spread for this segment represents the excess of the yield on invested assets on reserves over the average crediting rate on interest-sensitive products. The yield on invested assets on reserves is calculated as net investment income, excluding amounts attributable to our surplus investments and reverse repurchase agreement interest expense, divided by average invested assets on reserves. In addition, we exclude the impact of earnings from affordable housing tax credit securities, which is reflected as a reduction to federal income tax expense, from our spread calculations. Traditional products use interest income to build the policy reserves. Commercial mortgage loan prepayments and bond makewhole premiums and investment income on alternative investments can vary significantly from period to period due to a number of factors, and, therefore, may contribute to investment income results that are not indicative of the underlying trends.   Benefits   Details underlying benefits (dollars in millions) were as follows:            For the Three              Months Ended              March 31,              2009      2008      Change    Benefits                    Death claims direct and assumed   $ 565     $ 555       2 %  Death claims ceded     (242 )     (239 )     -1 %  Reserves released on death     (103 )     (104 )     1 %  Net death benefits     220       212       4 %  Change in reserves for products with                          secondary guarantees     53       26       104 %  Change in reserves for products with                          secondary guarantees - reinsurance     20       -      NM    Other benefits (1)     63       62       2 %  Total benefits   $ 356     $ 300       19 %                            Death claims per $1,000 of inforce     1.66       1.59       4 %       (1)  Other benefits includes primarily traditional product changes in reserves and dividends.       80       Benefits for this segment include claims incurred during the period in excess of the associated reserves for its interest-sensitive and traditional products. In addition, benefits include the change in reserves for our products with secondary guarantees. The reserve for secondary guarantees is impacted by changes in expected future trends of expense assessments causing unlocking adjustments to this liability similar to DAC, VOBA and DFEL. Additionally, we establish a reserve for reinsurance margin (reinsurance premiums paid less death benefit recoveries) and amortize this margin over the life of the expected insurance assessments for certain blocks of secondary guarantee UL business. When we experience unfavorable mortality, particularly on higher face amount claims, our reinsurance recoveries can increase significantly and are deferred, which reduces the amount by which the expense for the direct claims are offset by reinsurance. The reinsurance on our secondary guarantee UL business is excess of loss reinsurance, and this block has a large range of face amounts, both of which contribute to volatility in our actual experience of reinsurance recoveries as compared to our expectations.   Underwriting, Acquisition, Insurance and Other Expenses   Commissions and other general and administrative expenses that vary with and are related primarily to the production of new business are deferred to the extent recoverable and for our interest-sensitive products are generally amortized over the lives of the contracts in relation to EGPs. For our traditional products, DAC and VOBA are amortized on either a straight-line basis or as a level percent of premium of the related contracts, depending on the block of business.   Insurance Solutions – Group Protection   Income from Operations   Details underlying the results for Insurance Solutions – Group Protection (in millions) were as follows:           For the Three              Months Ended              March 31,              2009      2008      Change    Operating Revenues                    Insurance premiums   $ 390     $ 370       5 %  Net investment income     30       28       7 %  Other revenues and fees     2       1       100 %  Total operating revenues     422       399       6 %  Operating Expenses                          Interest credited     1       -      NM    Benefits     282       269       5 %  Underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other                          expenses     99       90       10 %  Total operating expenses     382       359       6 %  Income from operations before taxes     40       40       0 %  Federal income tax expense     14       14       0 %  Income from operations   $ 26     $ 26       0 %               For the Three              Months Ended              March 31,              2009      2008      Change    Income from Operations by Product Line                    Life   $ 1     $ 10       -90 %  Disability     25       15       67 %  Dental     (1 )     -      NM    Total non-medical     25       25       0 %  Medical     1       1       0 %  Total income from operations   $ 26     $ 26       0 %         81       Comparison of the Three Months Ended March 31, 2009 to 2008   Income from operations for this segment remained flat. Insurance premiums increased due primarily to normal, organic business growth in our non-medical products. The increase in insurance premiums and more favorable total non-medical loss ratio experience, slightly outside the low end of our expected range, entirely offset an increase to underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses. The increase in underwriting, acquisition and other expenses was in line with the increase in insurance premiums and included higher expenses attributable to our U.S. pension plans (see “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans” in our 2008 Form 10-K for additional information).   In the first quarter of 2009, we experienced exceptional short- and long-term disability loss ratios due primarily to favorable claims incidence and termination experience, which we do not believe are sustainable in future quarters. In addition, we experienced significantly unfavorable life loss ratios in the first quarter of 2009 due primarily to adverse mortality experience, the one-time adjustment noted below and the downward effects of whole-case pricing on premium rates, which we do not expect to recur in future quarters.   Benefits included a one-time adjustment of $3 million in the first quarter of 2009 relating to unfavorable waiver claim reserves.   We expect higher expenses attributable to our U.S. pension plans during 2009. See “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans” in our 2008 Form 10-K for additional information.   Sales relate to long-duration contracts sold to new contract holders and new programs sold to existing contract holders. We believe that the trend in sales is an important indicator of development of business in force over time.   Management focuses on trends in loss ratios to compare actual experience with pricing expectations because group-underwriting risks change over time. We believe that loss ratios in the 71-74% range are more representative of longer-term expectations for the composite non-medical portion of this segment. We expect normal fluctuations in this range, as claim experience is inherently uncertain, and there can be no assurance that experience will fall inside this expected range.   Insurance Premiums   Details underlying insurance premiums (in millions) were as follows:            For the Three              Months Ended              March 31,              2009      2008      Change    Insurance Premiums by Product Line                    Life   $ 142     $ 133       7 %  Disability     174       162       7 %  Dental     38       37       3 %  Total non-medical     354       332       7 %  Medical     36       38       -5 %  Total insurance premiums   $ 390     $ 370       5 %                            Sales   $ 54     $ 54       0 %     Our cost of insurance and policy administration charges are embedded in the premiums charged to our customers. The premiums are a function of the rates priced into the product and our business in force. Business in force, in turn, is driven by sales and persistency experience. Sales in the table above are the combined annualized premiums for our life, disability and dental products.   The business represented as “medical” consists primarily of our non-core EXEC-U-CARE® product. This product provides an insured medical expense reimbursement vehicle to executives for non-covered health plan costs. This product produces significant revenues and benefits expenses for this segment but only a limited amount of income. Discontinuance of this product would significantly impact segment revenues, but not income from operations.         82       Net Investment Income   We use our interest income to build the associated policy reserves, which is a function of our insurance premiums and the yields on our invested assets.

Broker commissions, which vary with and are related to paid premiums, are expensed as incurred. The level of expenses is an important driver of profitability for this segment as group insurance contracts are offered within an environment that competes on the basis of price and service.       83       RESULTS OF INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT   The Investment Management segment, through Delaware Investments, provides a broad range of managed account portfolios, mutual funds, sub-advised funds and other investment products to individual investors and to institutional investors such as private and public pension funds, foundations and endowment funds.

Income from Operations   Details underlying the results for Investment Management (in millions) were as follows:            For the Three              Months Ended              March 31,              2009      2008      Change    Operating Revenues                    Investment advisory fees – external   $ 44     $ 76       -42 %  Investment advisory fees – inter-segment     20       20       0 %  Other revenues and fees     18       24       -25 %  Total operating revenues     82       120       -32 %  Operating Expenses                          Underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other                           expenses     79       101       -22 %  Income from operations before taxes     3       19       -84 %  Federal income tax expense     2       7       -71 %  Income from operations   $ 1     $ 12       -92 %                            Pre-tax operating margin (1)     4 %     16 %               (1)  The pre-tax operating margin is determined by dividing pre-tax income from operations by operating revenues.   Comparison of the Three Months Ended March 31, 2009 to 2008   Income from operations decreased due primarily to the following:       ·  A reduction in investment advisory fees due to lower assets under management resulting primarily from continuing significant unfavorable equity markets and the impact of negative net flows in 2008; and     ·  A reduction in other revenues and fees due primarily to negative returns on seed capital driven by continuing significant unfavorable equity markets.   The decrease in income from operations was partially offset by lower asset-based expenses and the implementation of several expense management controls and practices that are focused on expense reduction initiatives.   Future Expectations   We expect lower earnings for this segment in 2009 than we experienced in 2008 due primarily to lower investment advisory fees, partially offset by lower asset-based expenses, due to the assets under management erosion from unfavorable equity market returns and negative net flows experienced during 2008.   The level of net flows may vary considerably from period to period, and, therefore, results in one period are not indicative of net flows in subsequent periods.   For factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in this section, see “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2008 Form 10-K, as updated in “Part II – Item 1A. Risk Factors” below, and “Forward-Looking Statements – Cautionary Language” in this report.         84       We provide information about certain of this segment’s operating revenue and operating expense line items, the period in which amounts are recognized, key drivers of changes and historical details underlying the line items and their associated drivers below.

Investment advisory fees – external include amounts that are ultimately paid to sub-advisors for managing the sub-advised assets. The amounts paid to sub-advisors are generally included in the segment’s expenses.   Investment advisory fees – inter-segment consists of fees for asset management services this segment provides to Retirement Solutions and Insurance Solutions for managing general account assets supporting fixed income products, surplus and separate account assets. These inter-segment amounts are not reported on our Consolidated Statements of Income as they are eliminated along with the associated expenses incurred by Retirement Solutions and Insurance Solutions. Retirement Solutions and Insurance Solutions report the cost as a reduction to net investment income, which is the same methodology that would be used if these services were provided by an external party.   Other Revenues and Fees   Other revenues and fees consists primarily of revenues generated from shareholder and administrative services, 12b-1 fees and the results from seed capital investments. Seed capital investments are important to establishing a track record for products that will later be sold to investors. These investments are valued at market value each reporting period and the change in market value impacts other revenues.         87       RESULTS OF LINCOLN UK   Lincoln UK is headquartered in Barnwood, Gloucester, England, and is licensed to do business throughout the United Kingdom. Lincoln UK focuses primarily on protecting and enhancing the value of its existing customer base. The segment accepts new deposits from existing relationships and markets a limited range of life and retirement income products. Lincoln UK’s product portfolio principally consists of unit-linked life and pension products, which are similar to U.S. produced variable life and annuity products, where the risk associated with the underlying investments is borne by the contract holders. The segment is sensitive to changes in the foreign currency exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the British pound sterling. A significant increase in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the British pound would have a significant adverse effect on the segment’s operating results.   Income from Operations   Details underlying the results for Lincoln UK (in millions) were as follows:            For the Three              Months Ended              March 31,              2009      2008      Change    Operating Revenues                    Insurance premiums   $ 10     $ 19       -47 %  Insurance fees     24       46       -48 %  Net investment income     13       21       -38 %  Total operating revenues     47       86       -45 %  Operating Expenses                          Benefits     19       31       -39 %  Underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other                           expenses     19       38       -50 %  Total operating expenses     38       69       -45 %  Income from operations before taxes     9       17       -47 %  Federal income tax expense     3       6       -50 %  Income from operations   $ 6     $ 11       -45 %                            Exchange Rate Ratio-U.S. Dollars to Pounds                          Sterling                          Average for the period     1.443       1.987       -27 %  End-of-period     1.435       1.985       -28 %   Comparison of the Three Months Ended March 31, 2009 to 2008   Excluding the effect of the exchange rate, income from operations for this segment decreased 25% due primarily to the following:       ·  A decline in insurance fees driven by lower average unit-linked account values resulting primarily from unfavorable markets as the average value of the Financial Time Stock Exchange (“FTSE”) 100 index was 31% lower than the first quarter of 2008; and     ·  A reduction in net investment income due to lower yields.   The decrease in income from operations was partially offset by lower volume and asset-based expenses, favorable claim experience and the implementation of several expense management controls and practices that are focused on expense reduction initiatives.           88      Future Expectations    We expect lower earnings for this segment in 2009 than we experienced in 2008, when excluding the impacts of unlocking. The expected decline is attributable to the following:       ·   Continued deterioration in general economic and business conditions that we believe will result in lower investment fee income and less favorable foreign exchange rates;     ·   Lower net investment income on the segment’s fixed deposits from the continuation of the low interest rate environment; and     ·   Lower net flows on unit-linked assets due to the current economic challenges, including the current expectation by analysts that a meaningful economic recovery, including reductions in unemployment, will not occur until 2010. If there were an immediate decline in the FTSE of approximately 18% from its level as of March 31, 2009, and/or sustained under performance over a number of months, we believe it would result in approximately $50 million, after-tax, unfavorable prospective unlocking of DAC, VOBA and DFEL related to reversion to the mean.   For factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in this section, see “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2008 Form 10-K, as updated in “Part II – Item 1A. Risk Factors” below, and “Forward-Looking Statements – Cautionary Language” in this report.   We provide information about this segment’s operating revenue and operating expense line items, the period in which amounts are recognized, key drivers of changes and historical details underlying the line items and their associated drivers below.   Insurance Premiums   Excluding the effect of the exchange rate, insurance premiums are primarily a function of the rates priced into the product and face amount of our insurance in force.   Our annualized policy lapse rate was 6.2% for the first quarter of 2009 compared to 6.3% for the corresponding period in 2008, as measured by the number of policies in force.   Insurance Fees   Details underlying insurance fees, business in force and unit-linked assets (in millions) were as follows:             For the Three              Months Ended              March 31,              2009      2008      Change    Insurance Fees                    Mortality assessments   $ 7     $ 9       -22 %  Expense assessments     16       30       -47 %  DFEL:                          Deferrals     (1 )     (1 )     0 %  Amortization, net of interest:                          Retrospective unlocking     (2 )     1      NM    Amortization, net of interest, excluding                          unlocking     4       7       -43 %  Total insurance fees   $ 24     $ 46       -48 %                                                          As of March 31,                 2009       2008      Change    Individual life insurance in force   $ 11,674     $ 18,283       -36 %   Excluding the effect of the exchange rate, individual life insurance in force decreased 12% in the first quarter of 2009 compared to the corresponding period in 2008.         89                  For the Three              Months Ended              March 31,              2009      2008      Change                        Unit-Linked Assets                    Balance at beginning-of-period   $ 4,978     $ 8,850       -44 %  Deposits     39       60       -35 %  Withdrawals and deaths     (108 )     (213 )     49 %  Net flows     (69 )     (153 )     55 %  Investment income and change in market value     (279 )     (608 )     54 %  Foreign currency adjustment     (79 )     (10 )    NM    Balance at end-of-period   $ 4,551     $ 8,079       -44 %   Excluding the effect of the exchange rate, unit-linked assets decreased 22% in the first quarter of 2009 compared to the corresponding period in 2008.   The insurance fees reflect mortality and expense assessments on unit-linked account values to cover insurance and administrative charges. These assessments, excluding the effect of the exchange rate, are primarily a function of the rates priced into the product, the face amount of insurance in force and the average unit-linked assets, which is driven by net flows on the account values and the financial markets. The segment’s fee income remains subject to volatility in the equity markets as it affects the level of the underlying assets that drive the fee income.   Net Investment Income   We use our interest income to build the associated policy reserves, which is a function of our insurance premiums and the yields on our invested assets.   Benefits   Benefits for this segment are recognized when incurred and include claims during the period in excess of the associated account balance for its unit-linked products.   Underwriting, Acquisition, Insurance and Other Expenses   Details underlying underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses (in millions) were as follows:            For the Three              Months Ended              March 31,              2009      2008      Change    Underwriting, Acquisition, Insurance and                    Other Expenses                    Total expenses incurred   $ 18     $ 28       -36 %  DAC and VOBA deferrals     (1 )     (1 )     0 %  Total expenses recognized before amortization     17       27       -37 %  DAC and VOBA amortization, net of interest:                          Retrospective unlocking     (5 )     (1 )    NM    Amortization, net of interest, excluding                          unlocking     7       12       -42 %  Total underwriting, acquisition, insurance                          and other expenses   $ 19     $ 38       -50 %           90       Commissions and other costs, which vary with and are related primarily to the production of new business, are deferred to the extent recoverable. DAC and VOBA related to unit-linked business are amortized over the lives of the contracts in relation to EGPs. For our traditional products, DAC and VOBA are amortized on either a straight-line basis or as a level percent of premium of the related contracts depending on the block of business.   RESULTS OF OTHER OPERATIONS   Other Operations includes investments related to the excess capital in our insurance subsidiaries, investments in media properties and other corporate investments, benefit plan net assets, the unamortized deferred gain on indemnity reinsurance, which was sold to Swiss Re in 2001, external debt and business sold through reinsurance. We are actively managing our remaining radio station clusters to maximize performance and future value. Other Operations also includes the Institutional Pension business, which is a closed block of pension business, the majority of which was sold on a group annuity basis, and is currently in run-off.

The increase in loss from operations was partially offset by the following:       ·  Lower interest and debt expenses as a result of a decline in interest rates that affect our variable rate borrowings partially offset by higher average balances of outstanding debt in the current period; and     ·  Lower other expenses due primarily to higher merger-related expenses in the first quarter of 2008 as a result of higher system integration work related to our administrative systems and relocation costs in the first quarter of 2008 associated with the move of our corporate office, partially offset by restructuring charges for expense initiatives in the first quarter of 2009.   Future Expectations   We expect lower earnings for Other Operations in 2009 than was experienced in 2008. The expected decline is attributable primarily to the following:       ·  Higher expected expenses attributable to restructuring charges of approximately $15 million to $20 million in the second quarter of 2009 related to recently announced expense reduction initiatives that are discussed further below;     ·  Lower investment income due to lower dividend income from our holdings of Bank of America common stock as it announced dividend rate cuts during the latter part of 2008 and early 2009, partially offset by higher investment income of $2 million per quarter prospectively related to the coinsurance agreement that we entered into on March 31, 2009 (see “Results of Insurance Solutions – Insurance Solutions – Life Insurance” and “Reinsurance” for more information);     ·  Lower investment income from a reduction in the distributable earnings that will be received from our insurance segments and lower dividends received from our other segments due to the current economic challenges, including the current expectation by analysts that a meaningful economic recovery, including reductions in unemployment, will not occur until 2010;     ·  Lower investment income on alternative investment income due to the market conditions in both the equity and credit markets (see “Consolidated Investments – Alternative Investments” below for additional information on our alternative investments);     ·  Lower investment income on fixed maturity securities and mortgage loans on real estate from the continuation of the low interest rate environment;     ·  Lower media earnings as we believe customers will continue to reduce their advertising expenses in response to the credit markets; and     ·  Higher expenses attributable to our U.S. pension plans (see “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans” in our 2008 Form 10-K for additional information).   In addition, the inclusion of run-off disability income business results within Other Operations due to the rescission of the Swiss Re reinsurance agreement mentioned above may create volatility in earnings going forward.   Sustained market volatility and the challenging economic environment continue to put pressure on many industries and companies, including our own. After reviewing the impact of this difficult economy on our anticipated sales and business activities, we initiated actions in the fourth quarter to streamline operations, reduce expenses and ensure that staffing levels were aligned with expected business activity. We focused on reducing the workforce, reducing capital spending and addressing corporate-wide discretionary spending.   As a result of shrinking revenues due to the impact of unfavorable equity markets on our asset management businesses and a reduction in sales volumes caused by the unfavorable economic environment, we have launched further initiatives to reduce expenses, including a 12% workforce reduction that was completed in April of 2009, that we believe will improve our capital position and preserve profits. The restructuring costs associated with these layoffs are included in other expenses within Other Operations.   For factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in this section, see “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2008 Form 10-K, as updated in “Part II – Item 1A. Risk Factors” below, and “Forward-Looking Statements – Cautionary Language” in this report.       92       Net Investment Income and Interest Credited   We utilize an internal formula to determine the amount of capital that is allocated to our business segments. Investment income on capital in excess of the calculated amounts is reported in Other Operations. If regulations require increases in our insurance segments’ statutory reserves and surplus, the amount of capital allocated to Other Operations would decrease and net investment income would be negatively impacted. In addition, as discussed below in “Review of Consolidated Financial Condition – Alternative Sources of Liquidity,” we maintain an inter-segment cash management program where certain subsidiaries can borrow from or lend money to the holding company to meet short-term borrowing needs. The inter-segment cash management program affects net investment income for Other Operations, as all inter-segment eliminations are reported within Other Operations.   Write-downs for other-than-temporary impairments decrease the recorded value of our invested assets owned by our business segments. These write-downs are not included in the income from operations of our operating segments. When impairment occurs, assets are transferred to the business segments’ portfolios and will reduce the future net investment income for Other Operations, but should not have an impact on a consolidated basis unless the impairments are related to defaulted securities. Statutory reserve adjustments for our business segments can also cause allocations of invested assets between the affected segments and Other Operations.   The majority of our interest credited relates to our reinsurance operations sold to Swiss Re in 2001. A substantial amount of the business was sold through indemnity reinsurance transactions resulting in some of the business still flowing through our consolidated financial statements. The interest credited corresponds to investment income earnings on the assets we continue to hold for this business. There is no impact to income or loss in Other Operations or on a consolidated basis for these amounts.   Benefits   Benefits are recognized when incurred for Institutional Pension products and disability income business.   Other Expenses   Details underlying other expenses (in millions) were as follows:            For the Three              Months Ended              March 31,              2009      2008      Change    Other Expenses                    Merger-related expenses   $ 7     $ 15       -53 %  Restructuring charges for expense initiatives     5       -      NM    Branding     5       8       -38 %  Retirement Income Security Ventures     2       2       0 %  Taxes, licenses and fees     2       2       0 %  Other     13       8       63 %  Total other expenses   $ 34     $ 35       -3 %   Other in the table above includes expenses that are corporate in nature including charitable contributions, certain litigation reserves, amortization of media intangible assets with a definite life, other expenses not allocated to our business segments and inter-segment expense eliminations, excluding those associated with our inter-segment investment advisory fees.   Merger-related expenses were the result of actions undertaken by us to eliminate duplicate operations and functions as a result of the Jefferson-Pilot merger along with costs related to the implementation of our new unified product portfolio and other initiatives. These actions will be ongoing and are expected to be substantially complete in the first half of 2009. Our current estimate of the cumulative integration expenses is approximately $215 million to $225 million, pre-tax, and excludes amounts capitalized or recorded as goodwill.         93       Starting in December 2008, we implemented a restructuring plan in response to the current economic downturn and sustained market volatility, which focused on reducing expenses. The expenses associated with this initiative are reported in restructuring charges for expense initiatives above. During the fourth quarter of 2008, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $8 million and expect our cumulative pre-tax charges to amount to approximately $40 million for severance, benefits and related costs associated with the plan for workforce reduction and other restructuring actions.   Interest and Debt Expenses   Our current level of interest expense may not be indicative of the future due to, among other things, the timing of the use of cash, the availability of funds from our inter-company cash management program and the future cost of capital.

For factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in this section, see “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2008 Form 10-K, as updated in “Part II – Item 1A. Risk Factors” below, and “Forward-Looking Statements – Cautionary Language” in this report.   For information on our counterparty exposure see “Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.”       95       Comparison of the Three Months ended March 31, 2009 to 2008   For the first quarter of 2009, the GLB net derivative results were unfavorable as the decline in the fair value of our derivative assets exceeded the decline in the fair value of our liabilities. These decreases were a result of increases in interest rates. The unfavorable result was attributable primarily to the fact that we were in an over hedged position for a period of time relative to the liability during the quarter. In addition, the adjustment to the liability for NPR, as required under SFAS 157, had an unfavorable effect on net income in the period. Although the NPR factor applied to the liability increased during the quarter, it was applied to a lower liability as of March 31, 2009, when compared to December 31, 2008; therefore, the net results were unfavorable in the first quarter of 2009.   For the first quarter of 2008, the GLB net derivative results were slightly unfavorable as the difference between the change in fair value of our liabilities relative to the change in derivative assets was offset by a favorable NPR adjustment as the factor increased and was applied to an increasing liability. See “GLB Net Derivative Results” below for a discussion of how our NPR adjustment is determined.   The favorable net GDB results were due primarily to intermittent market conditions that resulted in non-linear changes in reserves that our derivatives are not specifically designed to mitigate and losses from the strengthening of the dollar as compared to the euro, pound and yen.   The gain on reinsurance derivative/trading securities for 2009 was due primarily to the rescission of the Swiss Re indemnity reinsurance agreement covering certain disability income business, whereby we released the embedded derivative liability related to the funds withheld nature of the reinsurance agreement. This release of the embedded derivative liability increased net income by approximately $31 million. For more information, see “Reinsurance” below and Note 11.   For a discussion of the increase in realized losses on certain investments see “Consolidated Investments – Realized Loss Related to Investments” below.         96       Operating Realized Gain   Details underlying operating realized gain (dollars in millions) were as follows:            For the Three              Months Ended              March 31,              2009      2008      Change    Indexed Annuity Net Derivatives Results                    Change in fair value of S&P 500 call options   $ 18     $ 94       81 %  Change in fair value of embedded derivatives     (18 )     (97 )     -81 %  Associated amortization expense of DAC,                          VOBA, DSI and DFEL     -       1       -100 %  Total indexed annuity net derivatives results     -       (2 )     100 %  GLB                          Pre-DAC (1) amount     23       16       44 %  Associated amortization expense of DAC,                          VOBA, DSI and DFEL:                          Retrospective unlocking (2)     9       -      NM    Amortization, excluding unlocking     (16 )     (10 )     -60 %  Total GLB     16       6       167 %  GDB                          Pre-DAC (1) amount     96       12      NM    Associated amortization expense of DAC,                          VOBA, DSI and DFEL:                          Retrospective unlocking (2)     43       -      NM    Amortization, excluding unlocking     (58 )     (6 )    NM    Total GDB hedge cost     81       6      NM    Total Operating Realized Gain   $ 97     $ 10      NM         (1)  DAC refers to the associated amortization of DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL.     (2)  Related primarily to the emergence of gross profits.   Operating realized gain includes the following:   Indexed Annuity Net Derivative Results   Indexed annuity net derivatives results represent the net difference between the change in the fair value of the S&P 500 call options that we hold and the change in the fair value of the embedded derivative liabilities of our indexed annuity products. The change in the fair value of the liability for the embedded derivative represents the amount that is credited to the indexed annuity contract.   GLB   Our GWB, GIB and 4LATER® features have elements of both insurance benefits accounted for under SOP 03-1 and embedded derivatives accounted for under SFAS 133 and SFAS 157. We weight these features and their associated reserves accordingly based on their hybrid nature. For our GLBs that meet the definition of an embedded derivative under SFAS 133, we record them at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in realized gain (loss) on our Consolidated Statements of Income. In bifurcating the embedded derivative, we attribute to the embedded derivative the portion of total fees collected from the contract holder that relates to the GLB riders (the “attributed fees”). These attributed fees represent the present value of future claims expected to be paid for the GLB at the inception of the contract (the “net valuation premium”) plus a margin that a theoretical market participant would include for risk/profit (the “risk/profit margin”).         97       In order to determine our NPR, we utilize a model based on our holding company’s credit default swap spreads adjusted for objective factors, such as the liquidity of our holding company. Because the guaranteed benefit liabilities are contained within our insurance subsidiaries, we must apply subjective factors, such as the impact of our insurance subsidiaries’ claims-paying ratings, in order to determine a factor that is representative of a theoretical market participant’s view of the non-performance risk of the specific liability within our insurance subsidiaries, which requires management’s judgment. We continually evaluate our model and the objective and subjective assumptions used.   We include the risk/profit margin portion of the GLB attributed rider fees in operating realized gain and include the net valuation premium of the GLB attributed rider fees in excluded realized gain (loss). For our Retirement Solutions – Annuities and Retirement Solutions – Defined Contribution segments, the excess of total fees collected from the contract holders over the GLB attributed rider fees is reported in insurance fees.   We also include the change in the fair value of the derivatives that offsets the benefit ratio unlocking of our SOP 03-1 reserves on our GLB riders. These changes in reserves attributable to Retirement Solutions’ benefit ratio unlocking of its SOP 03-1 reserves for GLB riders and associated amortization of DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL is offset in benefits within income from operations. This approach excludes the benefit ratio unlocking from income from operations according to our definition of income from operations and instead reflects it within GLB net derivatives results, a component of excluded realized gain (loss). On our Consolidated Statements of Income, the benefit ratio unlocking is reported within benefits.   GDB   GDB represents the change in the fair value of the derivatives that offsets the benefit ratio unlocking of our SOP 03-1 reserves on our GDB riders, including our expected cost of the hedging instruments. These changes in reserves attributable to Retirement Solutions’ benefit ratio unlocking of its SOP 03-1 reserves for GDB riders and associated amortization of DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL is offset in benefits within income from operations. This approach excludes the benefit ratio unlocking from income from operations according to our definition of income from operations and instead reflects it within GDB derivatives results, a component of excluded realized gain (loss). On our Consolidated Statements of Income, the benefit ratio unlocking is reported within benefits.   Realized Loss Related to Certain Investments   See “Consolidated Investments – Realized Loss Related to Investments” below.   Gain (Loss) on Certain Reinsurance Derivative/Trading Securities   Gain (loss) on certain reinsurance derivative/trading securities represents changes in the fair values of total return swaps (embedded derivatives) theoretically included in our various modified coinsurance and coinsurance with funds withheld reinsurance arrangements that have contractual returns related to various assets and liabilities associated with these arrangements.         98       GLB Net Derivatives Results and GDB Derivatives Results   Details underlying GLB net derivatives results and GDB derivative results (in millions) were as follows:           For the Three              Months Ended              March 31,              2009      2008      Change    GLB Net Derivatives Results                    Net valuation premium, net of reinsurance   $ 22     $ 17       29 %  Change in reserves hedged     233       (375 )     162 %  Change in market value of derivative assets     (310 )     315      NM    Hedge program ineffectiveness     (77 )     (60 )     -28 %  Change in reserves not hedged (NPR component)     (55 )     92      NM    Change in SOP 03-1 reserve not hedged     (6 )     -      NM    Associated amortization expense of DAC,                          VOBA, DSI and DFEL:                          Retrospective unlocking (1)     (61 )     10      NM    Amortization, excluding unlocking     47       (33 )     242 %  Loss from the initial impact of adopting                          SFAS 157, after-DAC (2)     -       (33 )     100 %  Total GLB net derivatives results   $ (130 )   $ (7 )    NM                              GDB Derivatives Results                          Benefit ratio unlocking of SOP 03-1 reserves   $ (96 )   $ (12 )    NM    Change in fair value of derivatives, excluding                          expected cost of hedging instruments     57       1      NM    Associated amortization expense of DAC,                          VOBA, DSI and DFEL:                          Retrospective unlocking (1)     (17 )     -      NM    Amortization, excluding unlocking     24       6       300 %  Total GDB derivatives results   $ (32 )   $ (5 )    NM                                      (1)  Related primarily to the emergence of gross profits.        (2)  DAC refers to the associated amortization of DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL   GLB Net Derivatives Results   Our GLB net derivatives results represents the net valuation premium, the change in the fair value of the embedded derivative liabilities of our GLB products and the change in the fair value of the derivative instruments we own to hedge. This includes the cost of purchasing the hedging instruments.         99       Our GWB, GIB and 4LATER® features have elements of both insurance benefits accounted for under SOP 03-1 and embedded derivatives accounted for under SFAS 133 and SFAS 157. The SOP 03-1 component is calculated in a manner consistent with our GDB. We weight these features and their associated reserves accordingly based on their hybrid nature. For the GLB guarantees in our variable annuity products that are considered embedded derivatives, we record them on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value under SFAS 133 and SFAS 157. We use derivative instruments to hedge our exposure to the risks and earnings volatility that result from the embedded derivatives for GLBs. The change in fair value of these derivative instruments is designed to generally offset the change in fair value of the embedded derivatives. In the table above, we have presented the components of our GLB results, which can be volatile especially when sudden and significant changes in equity markets and/or interest rates occur. When we assess the effectiveness of our hedge program, we exclude the impact of the change in the liability related to the NPR required under SFAS 157. We do not attempt to hedge the change in the NPR component of the liability. The impact of the change in NPR has had the effect of reducing our GLB liabilities on our balance sheet by $585 million since the adoption of SFAS 157 on January 1, 2008. See above for information regarding the effect of the NPR on the GLB net derivative results for first three months of 2009 and 2008. For additional information on our guaranteed benefits, see “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Derivatives – Guaranteed Living Benefits” above. For additional information on our hedge program see “Reinsurance” below.   Our GLB net derivatives results also include the benefit ratio unlocking of SOP 03-1 reserves on our GLB riders. The benefit ratio unlocking of SOP 03-1 reserves for GLB riders is offset in GLB. See “GLB” above for additional information.   GDB Derivatives Results   Our GDB derivatives results represent the net difference between the benefit ratio unlocking of SOP 03-1 reserves on our GDB riders and the change in the fair value of the derivative instruments we own to hedge the benefit ratio unlocking, excluding our expected cost of the hedging instruments. The benefit ratio unlocking of SOP 03-1 reserves for GDB riders is offset in GDB. See “GDB” above for additional information.   Indexed Annuity Forward-Starting Option   Details underlying indexed annuity forward-starting option (dollars in millions) were as follows:            For the Three              Months Ended              March 31,              2009      2008      Change    Indexed Annuity Forward-Starting Option                    Pre-DAC (1) amounts   $ 1     $ (10 )     110 %  Associated amortization expense of DAC,                          VOBA, DSI and DFEL     -       5       -100 %  Gain from the initial impact of adopting                          SFAS 157, after-DAC (1)     -       10       -100 %  Total   $ 1     $ 5       -80 %       (1)  DAC refers to the associated amortization of expense of DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL.   The liability for the forward-starting option reflects changes in the fair value of embedded derivative liabilities related to index call options we may purchase in the future to hedge contract holder index allocations applicable to future reset periods for our indexed annuity products as required under SFAS 133 and SFAS 157. These fair values represent an estimate of the cost of the options we will purchase in the future, discounted back to the date of the balance sheet, using current market indications of volatility and interest rates, which can vary significantly from period to period due to a number of factors and therefore can provide results that are not indicative of the underlying trends.

We follow a balanced approach to investing for both current income and prudent risk management, with an emphasis on generating sufficient current income, net of income tax, to meet our obligations to customers, as well as other general liabilities. This balanced approach requires the evaluation of expected return and risk of each asset class utilized, while still meeting our income objectives. This approach is important to our asset-liability management because decisions can be made based upon both the economic and current investment income considerations affecting assets and liabilities. For a discussion on our risk management process, see “Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.”   Investment Portfolio Composition and Diversification   Fundamental to our investment policy is diversification across asset classes. Our investment portfolio, excluding cash and invested cash, is composed of fixed maturity securities, mortgage loans on real estate, real estate (either wholly-owned or in joint ventures) and other long-term investments. We purchase investments for our segmented portfolios that have yield, duration and other characteristics that take into account the liabilities of the products being supported.   We have the ability to maintain our investment holdings throughout credit cycles because of our capital position, the long-term nature of our liabilities and the matching of our portfolios of investment assets with the liabilities of our various products.   Fixed Maturity and Equity Securities Portfolios   Fixed maturity securities and equity securities consist of portfolios classified as AFS and trading. Mortgage-backed and private securities are included in both AFS and trading portfolios.         101       Details underlying our fixed maturity and equity securities portfolios by industry classification (in millions) are presented in the below tables. These tables agree in total with the presentation of AFS securities in Note 5; however, the categories below represent a more detailed breakout of the AFS portfolio; therefore, the investment classifications listed below do not agree to the investment categories provided in Note 5.

Refer to our 2008 Form 10-K “Trading Securities” section for further details.       103       AFS Securities   The general intent of the AFS accounting guidance is to reflect stockholders’ equity as if unrealized gains and losses were actually recognized, it is necessary that we consider all related accounting adjustments that would occur upon such a hypothetical recognition of unrealized gains and losses. Such related balance sheet effects include adjustments to the balances of DAC, VOBA, DFEL, other contract holder funds and deferred income taxes. Adjustments to each of these balances are charged or credited to accumulated other comprehensive income. For instance, DAC is adjusted upon the recognition of unrealized gains or losses because the amortization of DAC is based upon an assumed emergence of gross profits on certain insurance business. Deferred income tax balances are also adjusted because unrealized gains or losses do not affect actual taxes currently paid.   The quality of our AFS fixed maturity securities portfolio, as measured at estimated fair value and by the percentage of fixed maturity securities invested in various ratings categories, relative to the entire fixed maturity AFS security portfolio (in millions) was as follows:             Rating Agency      As of March 31, 2009      As of December 31, 2008    NAIC      Equivalent      Amortized      Fair      % of      Amortized      Fair      % of    Designation      Designation      Cost      Value      Total      Cost      Value      Total    Investment Grade Securities                                         1      Aaa / Aa / A     $ 31,466     $ 29,691       60.2 %   $ 32,595     $ 30,386       62.0 %   2      Baa       19,716       16,733       33.9 %     19,240       16,111       32.9 %  Total investment grade securities       51,182       46,424       94.1 %     51,835       46,497       94.9 %  Below Investment Grade Securities                                                     3      Ba       3,120       2,121       4.3 %     2,194       1,698       3.5 %   4     B       791       445       0.9 %     772       516       1.1 %   5      Caa and lower       532       257       0.5 %     251       131       0.3 %   6      In or near default       251       102       0.2 %     142       93       0.2 %  Total below investment grade securities       4,694       2,925       5.9 %     3,359       2,438       5.1 %  Total fixed maturity AFS securities     $ 55,876     $ 49,349       100.0 %   $ 55,194     $ 48,935       100.0 %                                                                Total securities below investment grade                                                    as a percentage of total fixed                                                    maturity AFS securities       8.4 %     5.9 %             6.1 %     5.1 %           Comparisons between the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”) ratings and rating agency designations are published by the NAIC. The NAIC assigns securities quality ratings and uniform valuations, which are used by insurers when preparing their annual statements. The NAIC ratings are similar to the rating agency designations of the Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations for marketable bonds. NAIC ratings 1 and 2 include bonds generally considered investment grade (rated Baa3 or higher by Moody’s, or rated BBB- or higher by S&P and Fitch), by such ratings organizations. NAIC ratings 3 through 6 include bonds generally considered below investment grade (rated Ba1 or lower by Moody’s, or rated BB+ or lower by S&P and Fitch).   As of March 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, 90.4% and 92.2%, respectively, of the total publicly traded and private securities in an unrealized loss status were rated as investment grade. See Note 5 for maturity date information for our fixed maturity investment portfolio. Our gross unrealized losses on AFS securities increased $177 million in the three months ended March 31, 2009, was primarily related to the cumulative adjustment of the recognition of OTTI. See Note 2 for further information. As more fully described in Note 5, we regularly review our investment holdings for OTTIs. We believe that the securities in an unrealized loss position as of March 31, 2009, were not other-than-temporarily impaired as we do not intend to sell these debt securities or it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the debt securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis, and we have the ability and intent to hold the equity securities for a period of time sufficient for recovery. For further information on our AFS securities unrealized losses, see “Additional Details on our Unrealized Losses on AFS Securities” below.   The estimated fair value for all private securities was $7.1 billion as of March 31, 2009, and December 31, 2008, representing approximately 11% of total invested assets as of March 31, 2009, and December 31, 2008.         104       Our fixed maturity securities include mortgage-backed securities. These securities are subject to risks associated with variable prepayments. This may result in differences between the actual cash flow and maturity of these securities than that expected at the time of purchase. Securities that have an amortized cost greater than par and are backed by mortgages that prepay faster than expected will incur a reduction in yield or a loss. Those securities with an amortized cost lower than par that prepay faster than expected will generate an increase in yield or a gain. In addition, we may incur reinvestment risks if market yields are lower than the book yields earned on the securities. Prepayments occurring slower than expected have the opposite impact. We may incur reinvestment risks if market yields are higher than the book yields earned on the securities and we are forced to sell the securities. The degree to which a security is susceptible to either gains or losses is influenced by: the difference between its amortized cost and par; the relative sensitivity of the underlying mortgages backing the assets to prepayment in a changing interest rate environment; and the repayment priority of the securities in the overall securitization structure.   We limit the extent of our risk on mortgage-backed securities by prudently limiting exposure to the asset class, by generally avoiding the purchase of securities with a cost that significantly exceeds par, by purchasing securities backed by stable collateral and by concentrating on securities with enhanced priority in their trust structure. Such securities with reduced risk typically have a lower yield (but higher liquidity) than higher-risk mortgage-backed securities. At selected times, higher-risk securities may be purchased if they do not compromise the safety of the general portfolio. As of March 31, 2009, we did not have a significant amount of higher-risk, trust structured mortgage-backed securities. A significant amount of assets in our mortgage-backed securities portfolio are either guaranteed by U.S. government-sponsored enterprises or are supported in the securitization structure by junior securities enabling the assets to achieve high investment grade status.   Our exposure to subprime mortgage lending is limited to investments in banks and other financial institutions that may be impacted by subprime lending and direct investments in ABS CDOs, ABS and residential mortgage-backed securities (“RMBS”). Mortgage-related ABS are backed by home equity loans and RMBS are backed by residential mortgages. These securities are backed by loans that are characterized by borrowers of differing levels of creditworthiness: prime, Alt-A and subprime. Prime lending is the origination of residential mortgage loans to customers with excellent credit profiles. Alt-A lending is the origination of residential mortgage loans to customers who have prime credit profiles but lack documentation to substantiate income. Subprime lending is the origination of loans to customers with weak or impaired credit profiles.   The slowing U.S. housing market, increased interest rates for non-prime borrowers and relaxed underwriting standards over the last several years have led to higher delinquency rates for residential mortgage loans and home equity loans. We expect delinquency rates and loss rates on residential mortgages and home equity loans to increase in the future; however, we continue to expect to receive payments in accordance with contractual terms for a significant amount of our securities, largely due to the seniority of the claims on the collateral of the securities that we own. The tranches of the securities will experience losses according to their seniority level with the least senior (or most junior), typically the unrated residual tranche, taking the initial loss. The credit ratings of our securities reflect the seniority of the securities that we own. Our RMBS had a market value of $8.6 billion and an unrealized loss of $1.1 billion, or 13%, as of March 31, 2009. The unrealized loss was due primarily to deteriorating fundamentals and a general level of illiquidity in the market resulting in price declines in many structured products.         105       The market value of investments backed by subprime loans was $388 million and represented 1% of our total investment portfolio as of March 31, 2009. Investments rated A or above represented 73% of the subprime investments and $185 million in market value of our subprime investments was backed by loans originating in 2005 and forward. AFS securities represent $378 million, or 97%, of the subprime exposure and trading securities represent $10 million, or 3%, as of March 31, 2009.

Monoline insurers guarantee the timely repayment of bond principal and interest when a bond issuer defaults and generally provide credit enhancement for bond issues such as municipal bonds and private placements as well as other types and structures of securities. Our direct exposure represents our bond holdings of the actual Monoline insurers. Our insured bonds represent our holdings in bonds of other issuers that are insured by Monoline insurers.

Additional Details on our Unrealized Losses on AFS Securities   When considering unrealized gain and loss information, it is important to recognize that the information relates to the status of securities at a particular point in time and may not be indicative of the status of our investment portfolios subsequent to the balance sheet date. Further, because the timing of the recognition of realized investment gains and losses through the selection of which securities are sold is largely at management’s discretion, it is important to consider the information provided below within the context of the overall unrealized gain or loss position of our investment portfolios. These are important considerations that should be included in any evaluation of the potential impact of unrealized loss securities on our future earnings.       110       We have no concentrations of issuers or guarantors of fixed maturity and equity securities.

Generally, below investment grade fixed maturity securities are more likely than investment grade securities to develop credit concerns. The remaining 76.9% and 87.2% of the gross unrealized losses as of March 31, 2009, and December 31, 2008, respectively, relate to investment grade AFS securities. The ratios of estimated fair value to amortized cost reflected in the table below were not necessarily indicative of the market value to amortized cost relationships for the securities throughout the entire time that the securities have been in an unrealized loss position nor are they necessarily indicative of these ratios subsequent to March 31, 2009.

Changing economic conditions impact our valuation of mortgage loans. Changing vacancies and rents are incorporated into the discounted cash flow analysis that we perform for monitored loans and may contribute to the establishment of (or an increase or decrease in) an allowance for credit losses. In addition, we continue to monitor the entire commercial mortgage loan portfolio to identify risk. Areas of emphasis are properties that have deteriorating credits or have experienced debt coverage reduction. Where warranted, we have established or increased loss reserves based upon this analysis. There were two impaired mortgage loans as of March 31, 2009, or .03% of total mortgage loans, and no impaired mortgage loans as of December 31, 2008. As of March 31, 2009, there were two commercial mortgage loans that were two or more payments delinquent and December 31, 2008, there were no commercial mortgage loans that were two or more payments delinquent. The total principal and interest due on the mortgage loans as of March 31, 2009, was less than $1 million. See Note 1 in our 2008 Form 10-K for more information regarding our accounting policy relating to the impairment of mortgage loans.         119       Alternative Investments   The carrying value of our consolidated alternative investments by business segment (in millions), which consists primarily of investments in limited partnerships, was as follows:           As of      As of        March 31,      December 31,        2009      2008    Retirement Solutions:              Annuities   $ 102     $ 89    Defined Contribution     60       72    Insurance Solutions:                  Life Insurance     560       603    Group Protection     37       8    Other Operations     12       4    Total alternative investments   $ 771     $ 776     Loss derived from our consolidated alternative investments by business segment (in millions) was as follows:            For the Three              Months Ended              March 31,              2009      2008      Change    Retirement Solutions:                    Annuities   $ (1 )   $ (1 )     0 %  Defined Contribution     -       (2 )     100 %  Insurance Solutions:                          Life Insurance     (5 )     (1 )    NM    Group Protection     -       -      NM    Other Operations     -       (1 )     100 %  Total alternative investments (1)   $ (6 )   $ (5 )     -20 %       (1)  Includes net investment income on the alternative investments supporting the required statutory surplus of our insurance businesses.   The decline in our investment income on alternative investments presented in the table above was due to continued deterioration of the financial markets. This weakness was concentrated primarily in our energy limited partnership holdings.   As of March 31, 2009, and December 31, 2008, alternative investments included investments in approximately 102 different partnerships. The partnerships represent a broadly diversified portfolio of asset classes. The investment strategy of the alternative investment portfolio is to provide incremental investment income compared to the traditional fixed-income and equity markets over a long term investment horizon. In addition, the portfolio represents approximately 1.6% of our overall invested assets. The portfolio is actively monitored to minimize the likelihood of material investment income losses.       120       The carrying value of our consolidated alternative investments by asset class (in millions) was as follows:            As of      As of        March 31,      December 31,        2009      2008                  Venture capital   $ 354     $ 341    Hedge funds     199       223    Real estate     113       110    Oil & gas     105       102    Total alternative investments   $ 771     $ 776       The partnerships do not represent off-balance sheet financing and generally involve several third-party partners. Select partnerships contain capital calls, which require us to contribute capital upon notification by the general partner. These capital calls are contemplated during the initial investment decision and are planned for well in advance of the call date. The capital calls are not material in size and are not material to our liquidity. The capital calls are included on the table of contingent commitments in “Review of Consolidated Financial Condition – Liquidity and Capital Resources” below. Alternative investments are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and are included in other investments on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.   Our venture capital portfolio is mainly comprised of private equity investments in various leveraged buyout and venture capital limited partnerships, which in turn, invest in a well-diversified portfolio across various industry sectors, geographies, and investment stages. The objective of making such investments is to achieve an excess long-term risk-adjusted return.   The hedge fund portfolio is broadly diversified and contains exposure to the strategies which we believe will have the best long-term risk-adjusted returns.   The real estate limited partnership portfolio tries to capture value-added returns in both equity and mezzanine positions in both traditional and specialized areas of the commercial and residential real estate markets including workforce housing.   Similar to our venture capital portfolio, we invest in various oil-and-gas limited partnerships that target a well diversified energy sector including exploration and production, storage and distribution (midstream), oil field services, and other energy-related services.   We account for our investments in limited partnerships (LPs) using the equity method to determine the GAAP carrying value. The LPs where LNC is a participant generally report their assets at fair value. Since the assets of the LPs are measured at fair value and the values of the LPs’ liabilities would generally approximate fair value according to the audited financial statements received from the partnerships, the GAAP carrying value on our consolidated balance sheet would approximate a fair value for our LP investments.    Non-Income Producing Investments   As of March 31, 2009, and December 31, 2008, the carrying amount of fixed maturity securities, mortgage loans on real estate and real estate that were non-income producing was $19 million and $15 million, respectively.         121       Net Investment Income   Details underlying net investment income (loss) (in millions) and our investment yield were as follows:             For the Three              Months Ended              March 31,              2009      2008      Change    Net Investment Income                    Fixed maturity AFS securities   $ 836     $ 857       -2 %  Equity AFS securities     2       9       -78 %  Trading securities     40       42       -5 %  Mortgage loans on real estate     118       117       1 %  Real estate     4       7       -43 %  Standby real estate equity commitments     -       1       -100 %  Policy loans     44       45       -2 %  Invested cash     10       19       -47 %  Commercial mortgage loan prepayment and bond makewhole premiums (1)     1       6       -83 %  Alternative investments (2)     (6 )     (5 )     -20 %  Other investments     4       2       100 %  Investment income     1,053       1,100       -4 %  Investment expense     (26 )     (35 )     26 %  Net investment income   $ 1,027     $ 1,065       -4 %       (1)  See “Commercial Mortgage Loan Prepayment and Bond Makewhole Premiums” below for additional information.

The profitability of our fixed annuity and life insurance products is affected by our ability to achieve target spreads, or margins, between the interest income earned on the general account assets and the interest credited to the contract holder on our average fixed account values, including the fixed portion of variable. Net investment income and the interest rate yield table each include commercial mortgage loan prepayments and bond makewhole premiums, alternative investments and contingent interest and standby real estate equity commitments. These items can vary significantly from period to period due to a number of factors and therefore can provide results that are not indicative of the underlying trends.   The decline in net investment income when comparing the first three months of 2009 to the same period in 2008 was attributable to our liquidity strategy of maintaining higher cash balances during the recent volatile markets which has reduced our portfolio yield and a decline in investment income on alternative investments.   Standby Real Estate Equity Commitments   Periodically, we enter into standby commitments, which obligate us to purchase real estate at a specified cost if a third-party sale does not occur within approximately one year after construction is completed. These commitments are used by a developer to obtain a construction loan from an outside lender on favorable terms. In return for issuing the commitment, we receive an annual fee and a percentage of the profit when the property is sold. Our long-term expectation is that we will be obligated to fund a small portion of these commitments. However, due to the current economic environment, we may experience increased funding obligations.   As of March 31, 2009, and December 31, 2008, we had standby real estate equity commitments totaling $263 million and $267 million, respectively. During the three months ended March 31, 2009, we funded commitments of $3 million and the fair value of the associated real estate is included on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We did not fund any commitments during the three months ended March 31, 2008.   Commercial Mortgage Loan Prepayment and Bond Makewhole Premiums   Prepayment and makewhole premiums are collected when borrowers elect to call or prepay their debt prior to the stated maturity. A prepayment or makewhole premium allows investors to attain the same yield as if the borrower made all scheduled interest payments until maturity. These premiums are designed to make investors indifferent to prepayment.   The decline in prepayment and makewhole premiums when comparing the three months ended March 31, 2009 to 2008 was attributable primarily to the continued tightening of credit conditions in the market resulting in less refinancing activity and less prepayment income.         123       Realized Loss Related to Investments   The detail of the realized loss related to investments (in millions) was as follows:            For the Three              Months Ended              March 31,              2009      2008      Change    Fixed maturity AFS securities:                    Gross gains   $ 55     $ 9      NM    Gross losses     (244 )     (100 )    NM    Equity AFS securities:                        Gross gains     3       3       0 %  Gross losses     (3 )     -      NM    Gain on other investments     (2 )     25      NM    Associated amortization expense of DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL and  changes in other contract holder funds and funds withheld  reinsurance liabilities     55       25       120 %  Total realized loss on investments, excluding trading securities     (136 )     (38 )    NM    Loss on certain derivative instruments     (17 )     (3 )    NM    Total realized loss on investments and certain derivative instruments,   excluding trading securities   $ (153 )   $ (41 )    NM                              Write-downs for OTTI included in realized loss on AFS securities above   $ (170)     $  (92)           -85  %   Amortization expense of DAC, VOBA, DSI, DFEL and changes in other contract holder funds reflects an assumption for an expected level of credit-related investment losses. When actual credit-related investment losses are realized, we recognize a true up to our DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL amortization and changes in other contract holder funds within realized loss reflecting the incremental impact of actual versus expected credit-related investment losses. These actual to expected amortization adjustments could create volatility in net realized gains and losses. The write-down for impairments includes both credit-related and interest-rate related impairments.   Realized gains and losses generally originate from asset sales to reposition the portfolio or to respond to product experience. During the first three months of 2009 and 2008, we sold securities for gains and losses. In the process of evaluating whether a security with an unrealized loss reflects declines that are other-than-temporary, we consider our ability and intent to hold the security until its value recovers. However, subsequent decisions on securities sales are made within the context of overall risk monitoring, assessing value relative to other comparable securities and overall portfolio maintenance. Although our portfolio managers may, at a given point in time, believe that the preferred course of action is to hold securities with unrealized losses that are considered temporary until such losses are recovered, the dynamic nature of portfolio management may result in a subsequent decision to sell. These subsequent decisions are consistent with the classification of our investment portfolio as AFS. We expect to continue to manage all non-trading invested assets within our portfolios in a manner that is consistent with the AFS classification.   We consider economic factors and circumstances within countries and industries where recent write-downs have occurred in our assessment of the status of securities we own of similarly situated issuers. While it is possible for realized or unrealized losses on a particular investment to affect other investments, our risk management has been designed to identify correlation risks and other risks inherent in managing an investment portfolio. Once identified, strategies and procedures are developed to effectively monitor and manage these risks. The areas of risk correlation that we pay particular attention to are risks that may be correlated within specific financial and business markets, risks within specific industries and risks associated with related parties.   When the detailed analysis by our credit analysts and investment portfolio managers leads to the conclusion that a security’s decline in fair value is other-than-temporary, the security is written down to estimated fair value. In instances where declines are considered temporary, the security will continue to be carefully monitored. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis – Introduction – Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” in our 2008 Form 10-K for additional information on our portfolio management strategy.       124       Details underlying write-downs taken as a result of OTTIs (in millions) that were recognized in earnings were as follows:            For the Three              Months Ended              March 31,              2009      2008      Change    Fixed Maturity Securities                    Corporate bonds   $ 85     $ 90       -6 %  MBS:                          CMOs     81       1      NM    ABS:                          CDOs     -       1       -100 %  Hybrid and redeemable preferred stock     1       -      NM    Total fixed maturity securities     167       92       82 %  Equity Securities                          Other financial services securities     3       -      NM    Total equity securities     3       -      NM    Total OTTI losses on AFS   $ 170     $ 92       85 %   When comparing the first three months of 2009 to 2008, the increase in write-downs for OTTIs on our AFS securities were attributable primarily to unfavorable changes in credit quality on certain corporate bond holdings within the Automotive and Gaming sectors, as well as deteriorating fundamentals within the housing market which affected select RMBS holdings.   The $170 million of impairments taken during the first three months of 2009 are split between $166 million of credit related impairments and $4 million on non-credit related impairments. The credit related impairments are largely attributable to our Automotive and Gaming sector holdings, RMBS, and mortgage related ABS holdings that have suffered from continued deterioration in housing fundamentals. The non-credit related impairments were incurred due to declines in values of securities for which we have an intent to sell.   REINSURANCE   Our insurance companies cede insurance to other companies. The portion of risks exceeding each of our insurance companies’ retention limits is reinsured with other insurers. We seek reinsurance coverage within the businesses that sell life insurance to limit our exposure to mortality losses and enhance our capital management.   Portions of our deferred annuity business have been reinsured on a modified coinsurance basis with other companies to limit our exposure to interest rate risks. As of March 31, 2009, the reserves associated with these reinsurance arrangements totaled $1.1 billion. To cover products other than life insurance, we acquire other insurance coverage with retentions and limits that management believes are appropriate for the circumstances. The consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 reflect premiums, benefits and DAC, net of insurance ceded. Our insurance companies remain liable if their reinsurers are unable to meet contractual obligations under applicable reinsurance agreements.   Our amounts recoverable from reinsurers represent receivables from and reserves ceded to reinsurers. As of March 31, 2009, and December 31, 2008, the amounts recoverable from reinsurers were $8.0 billion and $8.5 billion, respectively. We obtain reinsurance from a diverse group of reinsurers, and we monitor concentration and financial strength ratings of our principal reinsurers. Swiss Re represents our largest exposure. In 2001, we sold our reinsurance business to Swiss Re primarily through indemnity reinsurance arrangements. Because we are not relieved of our liability to the ceding companies for this business, the liabilities and obligations associated with the reinsured policies remain on our Consolidated Balance Sheets with a corresponding reinsurance receivable from the business sold to Swiss Re, which totaled $3.3 billion and $4.5 billion as of March 31, 2009, and December 31, 2008, respectively. Swiss Re has funded a trust with a balance of $1.9 billion as of March 31, 2009, to support this business. In addition to various remedies that we would have in the event of a default by Swiss Re, we continue to hold assets in support of certain of the transferred reserves. These assets consist of those reported as trading securities and certain mortgage loans. Our liability for funds withheld and our asset for embedded derivatives included $1.2 billion and $63 million, respectively, as of March 31, 2009, related to the business sold to Swiss Re.         125       We sold a block of disability income business to Swiss Re as part of several indemnity reinsurance transactions executed in 2001, as discussed above. On January 24, 2009, an award of rescission was declared related to an ongoing dispute between us and Swiss Re for this treaty, which requires us to be fully responsible for all claims incurred and liabilities supporting this block as if the reinsurance treaty never existed. See Note 11 for a discussion of the affects of the rescission.   On March 31, 2009, we entered into a 55% coinsurance agreement whereby we ceded a closed block of business consisting of certain UL and VUL insurance products to a third party reinsurer. See “Results of Insurance Solutions – Insurance Solutions – Life Insurance” and “Review of Consolidated Financial Condition” for more information.   From July 2007 until June 2008, we reinsured our Lincoln SmartSecurity® Advantage rider related to our variable annuities. Swiss Re provided 50% quota share coinsurance of our lifetime GWB, Lincoln SmartSecurity® Advantage, for business written in 2007 and 2008, up to a total of $3.8 billion in deposits.   We have a reinsurance treaty between LNL and another subsidiary of LNC, Lincoln National Reinsurance Company (Barbados) Limited (“LNBAR”) under which LNL reinsures certain guarantees associated with the GDB and GLB riders on its variable annuity products. In early January 2008, we entered into a reinsurance treaty between LLANY and LNBAR under which LLANY reinsures certain guarantees associated with the GLB riders on its variable annuity products. These treaties are traditional reinsurance programs where LNL and LLANY pay premiums to LNBAR, and LNBAR assumes the associated variable annuity rider guarantees. The hedge program that is designed to mitigate selected risk and income statement volatility from changes in equity markets, interest rates and volatility associated with the guaranteed benefit features of these variable annuity products is conducted in the LNBAR subsidiary. For more information on the results of our hedge program, see “Realized Loss” above.   For factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in this section, see “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2008 Form 10-K, as updated in “Part II – Item 1A. Risk Factors” below, and “Forward-Looking Statements – Cautionary Language” in this report.   REVIEW OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION   Liquidity and Capital Resources   Sources of Liquidity and Cash Flow   Liquidity refers to the ability of an enterprise to generate adequate amounts of cash from its normal operations to meet cash requirements with a prudent margin of safety. Our principal sources of cash flow from operating activities are insurance premiums and fees, investment advisory fees and investment income, while sources of cash flows from investing activities result from maturities and sales of invested assets. Our operating activities used net cash of $279 million for the first three months of 2009, and provided cash of $98 million for the first three months of 2008. When considering our liquidity and cash flow, it is important to distinguish between the needs of our insurance subsidiaries and the needs of the holding company, LNC. As a holding company with no operations of its own, LNC derives its cash primarily from its operating subsidiaries.   The sources of liquidity of the holding company are principally comprised of dividends and interest payments from subsidiaries, augmented by holding company short-term investments, bank lines of credit, a commercial paper program and the ongoing availability of long-term public financing under an SEC-filed shelf registration statement. These sources of liquidity and cash flow support the general corporate needs of the holding company, including its common stock dividends, interest and debt service, funding of callable securities, securities repurchases and acquisitions.   The disruptions in the capital markets experienced in the second half of 2008 continued into 2009. Although we currently continue to operate with adequate cash on the balance sheet and have access to alternate sources of liquidity, as discussed below in “Alternative Sources of Liquidity,” during this extraordinary market environment, management is continually monitoring and adjusting its liquidity and capital plans for LNC and its subsidiaries in light of changing needs and opportunities. A continued extended disruption in the credit and capital markets could adversely affect LNC and its subsidiaries’ ability to access sources of liquidity, and there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available to us on favorable terms, or at all, in the current market environment.         126       Since the filing of our 2008 Form 10-K, Moody’s and Fitch both downgraded certain of our financial strength ratings and debt ratings. On April 15, 2009, Moody’s downgraded our long-term credit rating to Baa2 (9th of 21) and also downgraded the financial strength ratings of LNL, LLANY and FPP to A2/A2/A2 (6th of 21), respectively. All ratings are currently under review for possible downgrade, which indicates that our ratings could be affirmed or lowered in the near term based on developments in financial market conditions and/or our business performance or financial measures. On April 16, 2009, Fitch downgraded our short-term debt ratings to F-2 (3rd of 7) and our long-term debt ratings to BBB (9th of 21) and also downgraded the financial strength ratings of LNL, LLANY and FPP to A+/A+/A+ (5th of 21), respectively. Fitch’s outlook on all of our ratings remained negative. In addition, on May 6, 2009, S&P revised its outlook for the holding company and insurance subsidiaries to negative from stable and affirmed all ratings.   We believe that the rating agencies may heighten the level of scrutiny that they apply to the U.S. life insurance sector, may increase the frequency and scope of their credit reviews, may request additional information from the companies that they rate and may adjust upward the capital and other requirements employed in the rating agency models for maintenance of certain ratings levels. In addition, actions we take to access third party financing may in turn cause rating agencies to reevaluate our ratings. For more information about ratings, see “Part I – Item 1. Business – Ratings” in our 2008 Form 10-K.   Details underlying the primary sources of our holding company cash flows (in millions) were as follows:            For the Three      For the        Months Ended      Year Ended        March 31,      December 31,        2009      2008      2008    Dividends from Subsidiaries                    LNL   $ -     $ 200     $ 400    First Penn-Pacific     -       -       50    Lincoln Financial Media (1)     -       658       659    Delaware Investments     3       15       51    Lincoln UK     -       -       24    Other     -       -       54    Loan Repayments and Interest from                           Subsidiary                          LNL interest on intercompany notes (2)     22       22       83       $ 25     $ 895     $ 1,321    Other Cash Flow and Liquidity Items                          Net capital received from stock option exercises   $ -     $ 7     $ 15         (1)  For 2008, amount includes proceeds on the sale of certain discontinued media operations.     (2)  Primarily represents interest on the holding company’s $1.3 billion in surplus note investments in LNL.   The table above focuses on significant and recurring cash flow items and excludes the effects of certain financing activities, namely the periodic issuance and retirement of debt and cash flows related to our inter-company cash management program (discussed below). Taxes have been eliminated from the analysis due to a tax sharing agreement among our primary subsidiaries resulting in a modest impact on net cash flows at the holding company. Also excluded from this analysis is the modest amount of investment income on short-term investments of the holding company.         127       Dividends from Subsidiaries   Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to certain insurance department regulatory restrictions as to the transfer of funds and payment of dividends to the holding company. Under Indiana laws and regulations, our Indiana insurance subsidiaries, including our primary insurance subsidiary, LNL, may pay dividends to LNC without prior approval of the Indiana Insurance Commissioner (the “Commissioner”) up to a certain threshold, or must receive prior approval of the Commissioner to pay a dividend if such dividend, along with all other dividends paid within the preceding twelve consecutive months exceed the statutory limitation. The current statutory limitation is the greater of 10% of the insurer’s contract holders’ surplus, as shown on its last annual statement on file with the Commissioner or the insurer’s statutory net gain from operations for the prior calendar year. As discussed in “Part I – Item 1. Business – Regulatory – Insurance Regulation” in our 2008 Form 10-K, we may not consider the benefit from the permitted practice to the prescribed statutory accounting principles relating to our insurance subsidiaries’ deferred tax assets in calculating available dividends. Indiana law gives the Commissioner broad discretion to disapprove requests for dividends in excess of these limits. New York, the state of domicile of our other major insurance subsidiary, LLANY, has similar restrictions, except that in New York it is the lesser of 10% of surplus to contract holders as of the immediately preceding calendar year or net gain from operations for the immediately preceding calendar year, not including realized capital gains.   We expect our domestic insurance subsidiaries could pay dividends of approximately $550 million in 2009 without prior approval from the respective state commissioners. The amount of surplus that our insurance subsidiaries could pay as dividends is constrained by the amount of surplus we hold to maintain our ratings, to provide an additional layer of margin for risk protection and for future investment in our businesses. We anticipate that the dividend capacity of our insurance subsidiaries will be substantially constrained for the remainder of 2009.   We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types and maturities. These investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks. An extended disruption in the credit and capital markets could adversely affect LNC and its subsidiaries’ ability to access sources of liquidity, and there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available to us on favorable terms, or at all, in the current market environment. In addition, further other-than-temporary impairments could reduce our statutory surplus, leading to lower RBC ratios and potentially reducing future dividend capacity from our insurance subsidiaries.   Subsidiaries’ Statutory Reserving and Surplus   Our insurance subsidiaries have statutory surplus and RBC levels above current regulatory required levels. As mentioned earlier, more than 73% of our life sales consist of products containing secondary guarantees, which require reserving practices under AG38. Our insurance subsidiaries are employing strategies to lessen the burden of increased AG38 and Valuation of Life Insurance Policies Model Regulation (“XXX”) statutory reserves associated with certain UL products and other products with secondary guarantees subject to these statutory reserving requirements. LNC will guarantee that its wholly-owned subsidiary, which reinsures a portion of the XXX reserves, will maintain a minimum level of capital and surplus as required under the insurance laws of South Carolina, its state of domicile. The surplus maintenance agreement will remain in effect until such time that we securitize the reserves, transfer the business to an unrelated party, sell or dissolve the wholly-owned subsidiary or receive notification from the state insurance department permitting the rescission of the guarantee.   Included in the letters of credit (“LOCs”) issued as of March 31, 2009, reported in the revolving credit facilities table in “Financing Activities,” was approximately $1.5 billion of LOCs supporting the reinsurance obligations of LNBAR on UL business with secondary guarantees. Recognizing that LOCs are generally one to five years in duration, it is likely that our insurance companies will apply a mix of LOCs, reinsurance and capital market strategies in addressing long-term AG38 and XXX needs. LOCs and related capital market alternatives lower the RBC impact of the UL business with secondary guarantee products. An inability to obtain the necessary LOC capacity or other capital market alternatives could impact our returns on UL business with secondary guarantee products.   We are continuing to pursue capital management strategies related to our AG38 reserves involving reinsurance and securitizations. As mentioned above in “Reinsurance,” we entered into a coinsurance agreement on March 31, 2009. The transaction resulted in the release of approximately $240 million of statutory capital previously supporting a closed block of business of certain UL and VUL insurance products and an RBC benefit of approximately 20 percentage points in 2009. See “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors – Attempts to mitigate the impact of Regulation XXX and Actuarial Guideline 38 may fail in whole or in part resulting in an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations” in our 2008 Form 10-K for further information on XXX reserves. In addition, a portion of our term life insurance business is reinsured with a domestic reinsurance captive as part of our overall strategy of managing the statutory capital of our insurance subsidiaries. There are no outstanding LOCs related to this business.       128       In September of 2008, the NAIC adopted a new statutory reserving standard, VACARVM, which will be effective as of December 31, 2009. We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of adopting VACARVM. This reserving requirement will replace current statutory reserving practices for variable annuities with guaranteed benefits and has the potential to require statutory reserves well in excess of current levels for certain variable annuity riders sold by us. The actual impact of the adoption will be dependent upon several factors including account values and market conditions that exist as December 31, 2009, the value of derivative and other assets supporting reserves whose change in value may be uncorrelated with the new reserving requirements, and the use of captive or third-party reinsurance. We are analyzing the current use of existing captive reinsurance structures, as well as additional third-party reinsurance arrangements, and hedging strategies relative to managing the negative impact on the level and volatility of statutory capital and dividend capacity in our life insurance subsidiaries. Depending on market conditions, reinsurance solutions and hedging strategies, additional statutory reserves could lead to lower RBC ratios and potentially reduce future dividend capacity of our insurance subsidiaries.    As a result of the unfavorable impacts from equity markets in the first quarter of 2009, we recognized higher reserves under Commissioners Annuity Reserve Valuation Method (“CARVM”) for our annuity products and higher reserves for GDB riders, which are only partially reinsured. CARVM is the current statutory actuarial method used for determining reserves for the base annuity contract. The impact of these items reduced the statutory surplus of LNL by approximately $75 million in the first quarter of 2009. We estimate that an S&P level of 700, a 12.5% drop from the March 31, 2009, level, would require an increase in statutory reserves, and thereby, further reduce statutory surplus of LNL by $80 million to $100 million at the end of the second quarter of 2009, related primarily to CARVM. As a result, we estimate that LNL’s estimated RBC ratio at the end of June 30, 2009, would be reduced by approximately 10 percentage points. The estimated potential increase to statutory reserves is based on the current statutory reserve formulas and does not take into account the reserve and asset adequacy analysis performed by our actuaries on an annual basis to determine appropriateness of the reserves at year end. This analysis incorporates the adequacy of assets in LNBAR, our captive reinsurance company, supporting the liabilities that it assumes from LNL. The outcome of this analysis may result in an additional reserve increase and could further reduce the RBC ratio.   The sensitivity of our statutory reserves and surplus established for our variable annuity base contracts and riders to changes in the equity markets will vary depending on the magnitude of the decline. The sensitivity will be affected by the level of account values relative to the level of guaranteed amounts, product design and reinsurance. Statutory reserves for variable annuities depend upon the cumulative equity market impacts on the business in force and therefore result in non-linear relationships with respect to the level of equity market performance within any reporting period. The RBC ratio is also affected by the product mix of the in-force book of business (i.e. the amount of business without guarantees is not subject to the same level of reserves as the business with guarantees). The RBC ratio of LNL is an important factor in the determination of the credit and financial strength ratings of LNC and its subsidiaries. The market value of our separate account assets increased in the first quarter of 2009, resulting in an $18 million increase in statutory surplus. The separate accounts include the impact of our variable annuities and also our credit-linked notes. However, our separate account assets remained less than the guaranteed liabilities that they support as of March 31, 2009. Future declines in the market values of our separate account assets could cause future reductions in the surplus of LNL, which may impact its RBC ratio and dividend capacity.   We have a reinsurance treaty between LNL and LNBAR under which LNL reinsures certain guarantees associated with the GDB and GLB riders on its variable annuity products and between LLANY and LNBAR under which LLANY reinsures certain guarantees associated with the GLB riders on its variable annuity products. We also reinsured with Swiss Re on a 50% quota share coinsurance basis rider sales on certain GLB business written from July 2007 until June 2008. These reinsurance arrangements serve to reduce LNL’s exposure to changes in the statutory reserves associated with changes in the equity markets; however, the reinsurance treaty between LNL and LNBAR does not limit our exposure to mortality losses. Both LNBAR and Swiss Re have established reserves for the business assumed and hold assets to support both the reserves and capital required by the respective regulatory agencies. For more details on LNBAR, see “Reinsurance” above.   Lincoln UK’s operations consist primarily of unit-linked life and pension products, which are similar to U.S. produced variable life and annuity products. Lincoln UK’s insurance subsidiaries are regulated by the U.K. Financial Services Authority (“FSA”) and are subject to capital requirements as defined by the U.K. Capital Resources Requirement. All insurance companies operating in the U.K. also have to complete an RBC assessment to demonstrate to the FSA that they hold sufficient capital to cover their risks. RBC requirements in the U.K. are different than the NAIC requirements. In addition, the FSA has imposed certain minimum capital requirements for the combined U.K. subsidiaries. Lincoln UK typically maintains approximately 1.5 to 2 times the required capital as prescribed by the regulatory margin. As is the case with regulated insurance companies in the U.S., changes to regulatory capital requirements can impact the dividend capacity of the U.K. insurance subsidiaries and cash flow to the holding company. Adverse market conditions resulted in a significant increase in corporate bond spreads, and combined with the restrictions imposed by the U.K. statutory valuation basis, surplus capital levels were insufficient to support a dividend payment to the holding company in the first quarter of 2009.         129       Financing Activities   Although our subsidiaries currently generate adequate cash flow to meet the needs of our normal operations, periodically we may issue debt or equity securities to maintain ratings and increase liquidity, as well as fund internal growth, acquisitions and the retirement of our debt and equity securities.   We currently have an effective shelf registration statement, which allows us to issue, in unlimited amounts, securities, including debt securities, preferred stock, common stock, warrants, stock purchase contracts, stock purchase units, depository shares and trust preferred securities of our affiliated trusts.   Details underlying debt and financing activities (in millions) were as follows:             For the Three Months Ended March 31, 2009                        Change                                Maturities      in Fair                    Beginning            and      Value      Other      Ending        Balance      Issuance      Repayments      Hedges      Changes (1)      Balance    Short-Term Debt                                      Commercial paper   $ 315     $ -     $ -     $ -     $ 371     $ 686    Current maturities of long-term debt     500       -               -       250       750    Total short-term debt   $ 815     $ -     $ -     $ -     $ 621     $ 1,436                                                      Long-Term Debt                                                  Senior notes   $ 2,555     $ -     $ -     $ (50 )   $ (250 )   $ 2,255    Bank borrowing     200       -       -       -       -       200    Federal Home Loan Bank                                                  of Indianapolis ("FHLBI") advance     250       -       -       -       -       250    Junior subordinated debentures                                                  issued to affiliated trusts     155       -       -       -       -       155    Capital securities     1,571       -       (87 )     -       1       1,485    Total long-term debt   $ 4,731     $ -     $ (87 )   $ (50 )   $ (249 )   $ 4,345         (1)  Includes the net increase (decrease) in commercial paper, non-cash reclassification of long-term debt to current maturities of long-term debt, accretion of discounts and (amortization) of premiums.   On April 6, 2009, we funded the maturity of a $500 million floating rate senior note, and we have reduced our commercial paper outstanding since March 31, 2009, to $210 million as of May 7, 2009 through dividends received during the second quarter of 2009 from LNL and LNBAR and internal borrowings. In addition, as of March 31, 2009, the holding company had $1.1 billion in cash and cash equivalents. Borrowings that are scheduled to mature within two years include a $250 million floating rate senior note due on March 13, 2010, and a $250 million 6.2% fixed rate senior note due on December 15, 2011. If the current difficult conditions continue and external refinancing is not available, we expect to use internal borrowings to meet the maturities. In addition, as presented below, we also have available lines of credit that we may access. The specific resources or combination of resources that we will use will depend upon, among other things, the financial market conditions present at the time of maturity.   In March of 2009, we early extinguished $87 million of principal on our capital securities and recognized a gain of $64 million, pre-tax. See Note 10 for additional information on the gain recognized on the early extinguishment of debt.         130       Details underlying our credit facilities with a group of domestic and foreign banks (in millions) were as follows:               As of March 31, 2009      Expiration    Maximum      Borrowings      Date    Available      Outstanding    Revolving Credit Facilities                Credit facility with the FHLBI (1)  Not Applicable   $ 378     $ 250    Five-year revolving credit facility  March 2011     1,750       -    Five-year revolving credit facility  February 2011     1,350       -    Total     $ 3,478     $ 250                        Letters of credit issued             $ 2,095                             (1)  Our borrowing capacity under this credit facility does not have an expiration date and continues while our investment in the Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis (“FHLBI”) common stock remains outstanding. The maturity dates of the borrowings are discussed below.   The LOCs support inter-company reinsurance transactions and specific treaties associated with our business sold through reinsurance. LOCs are used primarily to satisfy the U.S. regulatory requirements of our domestic insurance companies for which reserve credit is provided by our affiliated offshore reinsurance company, as discussed above, and our domestic clients of the business sold through reinsurance.   Under the credit agreements, we must maintain a minimum consolidated net worth level. In addition, the agreements contain covenants restricting our ability to incur liens, merge or consolidate with another entity where we are not the surviving entity and dispose of all or substantially all of our assets. As of March 31, 2009, we were in compliance with all such covenants. All of our credit agreements are unsecured.   If current debt ratings and claims-paying ratings were downgraded in the future, terms in our derivative agreements may be triggered, which could negatively impact overall liquidity. For the majority of our counterparties, there is a termination event should long-term debt ratings of LNC drop below BBB-/Baa3. As noted in “Sources of Liquidity and Cash Flow” above, our long-term debt currently holds a rating of BBB/Baa2. In addition, contractual selling agreements with intermediaries could be negatively impacted, which could have an adverse impact on overall sales of annuities, life insurance and investment products. See “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors – A decrease in the capital and surplus of our insurance subsidiaries may result in a downgrade to our insurer financial strength ratings” and “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors – A downgrade in our financial strength or credit ratings could limit our ability to market products, increase the number or value of policies being surrendered and/or hurt our relationships with creditors” in our 2008 Form 10-K for more information. See “Part I – Item 1. Business – Ratings” in our 2008 Form 10-K and “Sources of Liquidity and Cash Flow” above for additional information on our current bond ratings.   In the third quarter of 2008, LNL made an investment of $19 million in the FHLBI, a AAA-rated entity. We are allowed to borrow up to 20 times the amount of our common stock investment in FHLBI. All borrowings from the FHLBI are required to be secured by certain investments owned by LNL. On December 4, 2008, the LNC and LNL Boards of Directors approved an additional common stock investment of $56 million, which would increase our total borrowing capacity up to $1.5 billion. As of March 31, 2009, based on our common stock investment, we had borrowing capacity of up to approximately $378 million from FHLBI. We also had a $250 million floating-rate term loan outstanding under the facility due June 20, 2017, which may be prepaid beginning June 20, 2010.         131        Management is monitoring the covenants associated with LNC’s capital securities. If we fail to meet capital adequacy or net income and shareholders’ equity levels (also referred to as “trigger events”), terms in the agreements may be triggered, which would require us to make interest payments in accordance with an alternative coupon satisfaction mechanism (“ACSM”). If we determine that one of the following triggers exists as of the 30th day prior to an interest payment date (“determination date”), then the ACSM would apply:        1.  LNL’s RBC ratio is less than 175% (based on the most recent annual financial statement filed with the State of Indiana); or         2.  (i) the sum of our consolidated net income for the four trailing fiscal quarters ending on the quarter that is two quarters prior to the most recently completed quarter prior to the determination date is zero or negative, and (ii) our consolidated shareholders’ equity (excluding accumulated other comprehensive income and any increase in shareholders’ equity resulting from the issuance of preferred stock during a quarter) (“adjusted shareholders’ equity”) as of (x) the most recently completed quarter and (y) the end of the quarter that is two quarters before the most recently completed quarter, has declined by 10% or more as compared to the quarter that is ten fiscal quarters prior to the last completed quarter (the “benchmark quarter”).   The ACSM would require us to use commercially reasonable efforts to pay interest in full on the capital securities with the net proceeds from sales of our common stock and warrants on our common stock with an exercise price greater than the market price. We would have to utilize the ACSM until the trigger events above no longer existed. If we were required to utilize the ACSM and were successful in selling sufficient common shares or warrants to satisfy the interest payment, we would dilute the current holders of our common stock. Furthermore, while a trigger event is occurring and if we do not pay accrued interest in full, we may not, among other things, pay dividends on or repurchase our capital stock.    As a result of our consolidated net loss of $579 million for the three months ended March 31, 2009, we had a trailing four quarter consolidated net loss of $811 million. Accordingly, we have triggered test 2(i) looking forward to the quarter ending September 30, 2009. Also, looking forward to the quarter ending September 30, 2009, we have triggered test 2(ii)(y) above as our adjusted shareholders’ equity as of March 31, 2009, as compared to the benchmark quarter (March 31, 2007) has declined by 10% or more. If our adjusted shareholders’ equity as of September 30, 2009, increases by less than $29 million or further declines, then we would also trigger test 2(ii)(x) above, which would trigger the ACSM for at least our interest payments due on November 17, 2009, and January 20, 2010, of approximately $33 million.   For more information, see “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors – We will be required to pay interest on our capital securities with proceeds from the issuance of qualifying securities if we fail to achieve capital adequacy or net income and shareholders’ equity levels” and Note 13 in our 2008 Form 10-K.   Alternative Sources of Liquidity   In order to manage our capital more efficiently, we have an inter-company cash management program where certain subsidiaries can lend to or borrow from the holding company to meet short-term borrowing needs. The cash management program is essentially a series of demand loans, which are permitted under applicable insurance laws, among LNC and its affiliates that reduces overall borrowing costs by allowing LNC and its subsidiaries to access internal resources instead of incurring third-party transaction costs. For our Indiana-domiciled insurance subsidiaries, the borrowing and lending limit is currently the lesser of 3% of the insurance company’s admitted assets and 25% of its surplus, in both cases, as of its most recent year end.   The holding company had an average borrowing balance of $423 million from the cash management program during the first quarter of 2009. The holding company had a maximum and minimum amount of financing that is used from the cash management program during this period of $603 million and $250 million, respectively. The balance as of March 31, 2009, was $392 million.   Our insurance subsidiaries, by virtue of their general account fixed income investment holdings, can access liquidity through securities lending programs and repurchase agreements. As of March 31, 2009, our insurance subsidiaries had securities with a carrying value of $311 million out on loan under the securities lending program and $460 million carrying value subject to reverse-repurchase agreements. The cash received in our securities lending program is typically invested in cash equivalents, short-term investments or fixed maturity securities.   LNC has a $1.0 billion commercial paper program that is rated A-2, P-2 and F2. We believe that a further downgrade of our short-term debt ratings will make it more expensive to sell additional commercial paper, and it may make it more likely that we will have to utilize other sources of liquidity, including our credit facilities, for liquidity purposes. The commercial paper program is backed by a bank line of credit. During the first quarter of 2009, LNC had an average of $532 million in commercial paper outstanding with a maximum amount of $776 million outstanding at any time. LNC had $686 million of commercial paper outstanding as of March 31, 2009.       132       Included in the $686 million of commercial paper outstanding as of March 31, 2009, was $375 million that was issued under the Commercial Paper Funding Facility (“CPFF”) program. We are not currently eligible to issue new commercial paper under the CPFF. As of May 8, 2009, we had $70 million of commercial paper remaining under the CPFF, which is scheduled to mature in May of 2009.   On January 8, 2009, the Office of Thrift Supervision approved LNC’s application to become a savings and loan holding company and its acquisition of Newton County Loan & Savings, FSB, a federally regulated savings bank, located in Indiana. LNC contributed $10 million to the capital of Newton County Loan & Savings, FSB, and closed on the purchase on January 15, 2009. LNC also previously filed an application to participate in the CPP. LNC’s application to participate in the CPP is subject to approval from the U.S. Treasury. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that our application will be approved or that we will participate in the CPP if approved.   For factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in this section, see “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2008 Form 10-K, as updated in “Part II – Item 1A. Risk Factors” below, and “Forward-Looking Statements – Cautionary Language” in this report.   Divestitures   For a discussion of our divestitures, see Note 3.   Uses of Capital   Our principal uses of cash are to pay policy claims and benefits, operating expenses, commissions and taxes, to purchase new investments, to purchase reinsurance, to fund policy surrenders and withdrawals, to pay dividends to our stockholders and to repurchase our stock and debt securities.   Return of Capital to Stockholders   One of the holding company’s primary goals is to provide a return to our stockholders. Through dividends and stock repurchases, we have an established record of providing significant cash returns to our stockholders. In determining dividends, the Board takes into consideration items such as current and expected earnings, capital needs, rating agency considerations and requirements for financial flexibility. Details underlying this activity (in millions, except per share data) were as follows:            For the Three            For the        Months Ended            Year Ended        March 31,            December 31,        2009      2008      Change      2008    Dividends to stockholders   $ 54     $ 110       -51 %   $ 429    Repurchase of common stock     -       286       -100 %     476    Total cash returned to stockholders   $ 54     $ 396       -86 %   $ 905    Number of shares repurchased     -       5.450       -100 %     9.091    Average price per share   $ -     $ 52.42       -100 %   $ 52.31     Note: Average price per share is calculated using whole dollars instead of dollars rounded to millions.   On February 24, 2009, the Board of Directors approved a reduction of the dividend on our common stock from $0.21 to $0.01 per share, which, along with a prior reduction, is expected to add approximately $100 million to capital each quarter. Additionally, we have suspended stock repurchase activity. We expect that both of these changes will favorably impact our capital position prospectively in light of the recent market volatility and extraordinary events and developments affecting financial markets.         133       Significant Trends in Sources and Uses of Cash Flow  As stated above, LNC’s cash flow, as a holding company, is largely dependent upon the dividend capacity of its insurance company subsidiaries as well as their ability to otherwise forward funds to it through inter-company borrowing arrangements, which may be impacted by factors influencing the insurance subsidiaries’ RBC and statutory earnings performance. We expect to be able to meet the holding company’s ongoing cash needs with a combination of commercial paper as available and our inter-company cash management program. We also have access to $1.0 billion in bank credit lines, as noted above, none of which are currently drawn. We are continuing to explore our options with regard to managing our liquidity and capital positions and expect that the available holding company borrowing sources combined with the previously mentioned dividend reductions, suspension of share repurchases and enterprise-wide restructuring program that is expected to generate $250 million, pre-tax, in annual savings will satisfy reduced holding company cash requirements for the foreseeable future. In addition, we are exploring our options with regard to protecting and building capital at the insurance company subsidiaries. Note, a continuation of or an acceleration of poor capital market conditions, which reduces our insurance subsidiaries’ statutory surplus and RBC, may require them to retain more capital and may pressure our subsidiaries’ dividends to the holding company, which may lead us to take steps to preserve or raise additional capital. For factors that could affect our expectations for liquidity and capital, see “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2008 Form 10-K, as updated in “Part II – Item 1A. Risk Factors” below.    OTHER MATTERS   Other Factors Affecting Our Business   In general, our businesses are subject to a changing social, economic, legal, legislative and regulatory environment. Some of the changes include initiatives to require more reserves to be carried by our insurance subsidiaries. Although the eventual effect on us of the changing environment in which we operate remains uncertain, these factors and others could have a material effect on our results of operations, liquidity and capital resources. For factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in this section, see “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2008 Form 10-K, as updated in “Part II – Item 1A. Risk Factors” below, and “Forward-Looking Statements – Cautionary Language” in this report.   Recent Accounting Pronouncements   See Note 2 for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements that have been implemented during the periods presented or that have been issued and are to be implemented in the future.   Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk   We analyze and manage the risks arising from market exposures of financial instruments, as well as other risks, in an integrated asset-liability management process that takes diversification into account. By aggregating the potential effect of market and other risks on the entire enterprise, we estimate, review and in some cases manage the risk to our earnings and shareholder value. We have exposures to several market risks including interest rate, foreign currency exchange, equity market, default, basis and credit. The exposure of financial instruments to market risks, and the related risk management process, are most important to our Retirement Solutions and Insurance Solutions businesses, where most of the invested assets support accumulation and investment-oriented insurance products. As an important element of our integrated asset-liability management process, we use derivatives to minimize the effects of changes in interest levels, the shape of the yield curve, currency movements and volatility. In this context, derivatives are designated as a hedge and serve to minimize interest rate risk by mitigating the effect of significant increases in interest rates on our earnings. Additional market exposures exist in our other general account insurance products and in our debt structure and derivatives positions. Our primary sources of market risk are: substantial, relatively rapid and sustained increases or decreases in interest rates; fluctuations in currency exchange rates; or a sharp drop in equity market values. These market risks are discussed in detail in the following pages and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements (“Notes”) presented in “Item 1. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” as well as “Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”).         134       Derivatives Hedging Equity Market Risk   Impact of Equity Market Sensitivity   Due to the use of our reversion to the mean (“RTM”) process and our hedging strategies as described in “MD&A – Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” in Item 2 above and in Item 7 of our 2008 Form 10-K, we expect that, in general, short-term fluctuations in the equity markets should not have a significant impact on our quarterly earnings from unlocking of assumptions for DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL, as we do not unlock our long-term equity market assumptions based upon short-term fluctuations in the equity markets. However, there is an impact to earnings from the effects of equity market movements on account values and assets under management and the related asset-based fees we earn on those assets net of related expenses we incur based upon the level of assets. The following table presents our estimate of the after-tax, after-DAC, impact on income from operations (in millions), from the change in asset-based fees and related expenses, if the level of the S&P 500 were to remain at 800 from March 31, 2009, through the remainder of 2009 or dropped to 700 immediately after March 31, 2009, and remain at that level through the remainder of 2009, excluding any impact related to sales, prospective unlocking, persistency, hedge program performance or customer behavior caused by the equity market change:            S&P 500      S&P 500        at 700 (2)      at 800 (2)    Segment              Retirement Solutions - Annuities (1)   $ (32 )   $ (10 )  Retirement Solutions - Defined Contribution (1)     (8 )     (4 )  Investment Management     (6 )     -         (1)  If the level of the S&P 500 index dropped to 700 immediately after March 31, 2009, and remained at that level in subsequent periods we project that we would have a RTM prospective unlocking of approximately $255 million to $315 million, after-tax, for Retirement Solutions around mid-2010. If the level of the S&P 500 index remained at the March 31, 2009, level of approximately 800 in subsequent periods we project that we would have a RTM prospective unlocking of approximately $200 million to $240 million, after-tax, for Retirement Solutions late in 2011.     (2)  The baseline for these impacts assumes 2.25% growth per quarter beginning with the first quarter of 2009 earnings, when excluding the impacts of retrospective unlocking and federal tax return true-ups. The baseline is then compared to scenarios of S&P 500 at 700 and 800, which assume the index stays at those levels for the remainder of 2009. The difference between the baseline and S&P 500 at 700 and 800 scenarios is presented in the table.   The impact on earnings summarized above is an expected effect for the remainder of 2009. The effect of quarterly equity market changes upon fee revenues and asset-based expenses will not be fully recognized in the current quarter because fee revenues are earned and related expenses are incurred based upon daily variable account values. The difference between the current period average daily variable account values compared to the end of period variable account values impacts fee revenues in subsequent periods. Additionally, the impact on earnings may not necessarily be symmetrical with comparable increases in the equity markets. This discussion concerning the estimated effects of ongoing equity market volatility on the fees we earn from account values and assets under management is intended to be illustrative. Actual effects may vary depending on a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control, such as changing customer behaviors that might result in changes in the mix of our business between variable and fixed annuity contracts, switching among investment alternatives available within variable products, changes in sales production levels or changes in policy persistency. For purposes of this guidance, the change in account values is assumed to correlate with the change in the relevant index.   Credit-Related Derivatives   We use credit-related derivatives to minimize our exposure to credit-related events and we also sell credit default swaps to offer credit protection to our contract holders. Credit default swaps are derivatives that can be used by companies to hedge against a drop in bond prices due to credit concerns of certain bond issuers. A credit default swap allows an investor to put the bond back to the counterparty at par upon a credit event by the bond issuer. A credit event can include, among other items, bankruptcy, failure to pay or obligation acceleration. We can use various credit-related derivatives to minimize exposure to various credit-related risks. As of March 31, 2009, and December 31, 2008, we had no purchased credit default swaps outstanding. On a limited basis we also sell credit default swaps to offer credit protection to investors through trades that replicate the purchase of a fixed maturity security. When credit protection is sold, it is typically to replicate the purchase of a bond, similar to other investing activities.  As of March 31, 2009, and December 31, 2008, we had credit default swaps with a notional amount of $164 million and $149 million, which expire in 2010 through 2017.         135       Credit Risk    Through the use of derivative instruments, we are exposed to both credit risk (our counterparty fails to make payment) and market risk (the value of the instrument falls). When the fair value of a derivative contract is positive, this generally indicates that the counterparty owes us and, therefore, creates a credit risk for us equal to the extent of the fair value gain in the derivative. When the fair value of a derivative contract is negative, this generally indicates we owe the counterparty and therefore we have no credit risk, but have been affected by market risk. We minimize the credit risk in derivative instruments by entering into transactions with high quality counterparties with minimum credit ratings that are reviewed regularly by us, by limiting the amount of credit exposure to any one counterparty, and by requiring certain counterparties to post collateral if our credit risk exceeds certain limits. We also maintain a policy of requiring all derivative contracts to be governed by an International Swaps and Derivatives Association (“ISDA”) Master Agreement. We do not believe that the credit or market risks associated with derivative instruments are material to any insurance subsidiary or to us.   We have derivative positions with counterparties. Assuming zero recovery value, our exposure is the positive market value of the derivative positions with a counterparty, less collateral, that would be lost if the counterparty were to default. As of March 31, 2009, and December 31, 2008, our counterparty risk exposure, net of collateral, was $448 million and $562 million, respectively. Of this exposure, $163 million and $145 million, respectively was related to our program to hedge our variable annuity guaranteed benefits. We have exposure to 18 counterparties, with a maximum exposure of $182 million, net of collateral, to a single counterparty. The credit risk associated with such agreements is minimized by purchasing such agreements from financial institutions with long-standing, superior performance records. For the majority of LNC counterparties, there is a termination event should long-term debt ratings of LNC rating drop below BBB-/Baa3. Additionally, we maintain a policy of requiring all derivative contracts to be governed by an ISDA Master Agreement.   As of March 31, 2009, and December 31, 2008, our fair value of counterparty exposure (in millions) was as follows:              As of      As of          March 31,      December 31,          2009      2008    Rating                AAA     $ 5     $ 20    AA       290       333   A       153       209    Total     $ 448     $ 562      Item 4. Controls and Procedures   Conclusions Regarding Disclosure Controls and Procedures   We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, which are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As of the end of the period covered by this report, we, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as that term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting them to material information relating to us and our consolidated subsidiaries required to be disclosed in our periodic reports under the Exchange Act.   Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting   There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as that term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended March 31, 2009, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.       136         A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the company have been detected. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.   PART II – OTHER INFORMATION   Item 1. Legal Proceedings   Information regarding reportable legal proceedings is contained in “Part I – Item 3. Legal Proceedings” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008.   Item 1A. Risk Factors   The risk factor set forth below updates those set forth in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008. You should carefully consider the risks described below before investing in our securities. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing our company. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations. If any of these risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially affected. In that case, the value of our securities could decline substantially.   Because we are a holding company with no direct operations, the inability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends to us in sufficient amounts would harm our ability to meet our obligations.   We are a holding company, and we have no direct operations. Our principal assets are the capital stock of our insurance subsidiaries.   At the holding company level, sources of liquidity in normal markets include a variety of short-term and long-term instruments, including credit facilities, commercial paper and medium-term and long-term debt. However, our ability to meet our obligations for payment of interest and principal on outstanding debt obligations and to pay dividends to shareholders, repurchase our securities and pay corporate expenses depends primarily on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or to advance or repay funds to us. Under Indiana laws and regulations, our Indiana insurance subsidiaries, including our primary insurance subsidiary, The Lincoln National Life Insurance Company, may pay dividends to us without prior approval of the Indiana Insurance Commissioner (the “Commissioner”) up to a certain threshold, or must receive prior approval of the Commissioner to pay a dividend if such dividend, along with all other dividends paid within the preceding twelve consecutive months exceed the statutory limitation. The current Indiana statutory limitation is the greater of 10% of the insurer’s contract holders’ surplus, as shown on its last annual statement on file with the Commissioner or the insurer’s statutory net gain from operations for the prior calendar year.   In addition, payments of dividends and advances or repayment of funds to us by our insurance subsidiaries are restricted by the applicable laws of their respective jurisdictions requiring that our insurance subsidiaries hold a specified amount of minimum reserves in order to meet future obligations on their outstanding policies. These regulations specify that the minimum reserves shall be calculated to be sufficient to meet future obligations, giving consideration for required future premiums to be received, are based on certain specified mortality and morbidity tables, interest rates and methods of valuation, which are subject to change. In order to meet their claims-paying obligations, our insurance subsidiaries regularly monitor their reserves to ensure we hold sufficient amounts to cover actual or expected contract and claims payments. At times, we may determine that reserves in excess of the minimum may be needed to ensure sufficiency.   Changes in these laws can constrain the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or to advance or repay funds to us in sufficient amounts and at times necessary to meet our debt obligations and corporate expenses. For example, in September of 2008, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners adopted a new statutory reserving method known as Commissioners Annuity Reserve Valuation Method for Variable Annuities (“VACARVM”), which will be effective as of December 31, 2009. VACARVM has the potential to require statutory reserves well in excess of current levels for certain variable annuity riders sold by us. Requiring our insurance subsidiaries to hold additional reserves will constrain their ability to pay dividends to the holding company.         137       Assets in the investment general accounts of our insurance subsidiaries support their reserve liabilities. As of March 31, 2009, 74.6% of investment general account assets are AFS fixed maturity (delete “income” from sentence) securities of various holdings, types and maturities. These investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks. Beginning in 2008 and continuing into 2009, the capital and credit markets have experienced an unusually high degree of volatility. As a result, the market for fixed income securities has experienced illiquidity, increased price volatility, credit downgrade events and increased expected probability of default. Securities that are less liquid are more difficult to value and may be hard to sell, if desired. These market disruptions have led to increased impairments of securities in the general accounts of our insurance subsidiaries, thereby reducing contract holders’ surplus.   The earnings of our insurance subsidiaries also impact contract holders’ surplus. Principal sources of earnings are insurance premiums and fees, annuity considerations, investment advisory fees, and income from our investment portfolio and assets, consisting mainly of cash or assets that are readily convertible into cash. Recent economic conditions have resulted in lower earnings in our insurance subsidiaries. Lower earnings constrain the growth in the insurance subsidiaries’ capital, and therefore, the payment of dividends and advances or repayment of funds to us.   In addition, the amount of surplus that our insurance subsidiaries could pay as dividends is constrained by the amount of surplus they hold to maintain their financial strength ratings, to provide an additional layer of margin for risk protection and for future investment in our businesses. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we believe that our insurance subsidiaries have sufficient liquidity to meet their policy holder obligations and maintain their operations.   The result of the difficult economic and market conditions in reducing the contract holders’ surplus of our insurance subsidiaries has affected our ability to pay shareholder dividends and to engage in share repurchases. We have taken actions to reduce the holding company’s liquidity needs, including reducing our quarterly common dividend to $0.01 per share and retiring long-term debt and outstanding commercial paper in order to reduce our short-term borrowing needs. Notwithstanding that the contract holders’ surplus of our insurance subsidiaries may limit the amount of dividends and funds they can transfer to the holding company, we believe that the holding company’s ongoing cash needs will continued to be met with a combination of commercial paper as available and a contractual inter-company borrowing facility of up to $1 billion as well as access, if necessary, to $1 billion in bank credit lines, none of which are currently drawn. However, a further downgrade of our short-term credit ratings by Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s or Fitch may limit our ability to access the commercial paper market and cause us to lean more heavily on our inter-company borrowing facility and to access our bank credit lines. In the event that current resources do not satisfy our current needs, we may have to seek additional financing, which may not be available or only available with unfavorable terms and conditions.
