Item 1A. Risk Factors,” “Part II – Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and “Part II – Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”  In this report, in addition to providing consolidated revenues and net income (loss), we also provide segment operating revenues and income (loss) from operations because we believe they are meaningful measures of revenues and the profitability of our operating segments. Income (loss) from operations is net income recorded in accordance with United States of America generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) excluding the after-tax effects of the following items, as applicable:      •    Realized gains and losses associated with the following (“excluded realized gain (loss)”):        •    Sale or disposal of securities;        •    Impairments of securities;        •    Change in the fair value of embedded derivatives within certain reinsurance arrangements and the change in the fair value of related trading securities;        •    Change in the fair value of the embedded derivatives of our guaranteed living benefits (“GLB”) within our variable annuities net of the change in the fair value of the derivatives we own to hedge the changes in the embedded derivative;        •    Net difference between the benefit ratio unlocking of Statement of Position (“SOP”) No. 03-1, “Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises for Certain Nontraditional Long-Duration Contracts and for Separate Accounts” (“SOP 03-1”) reserves on our guaranteed death benefit (“GDB”) riders within our variable annuities and the change in the fair value of the derivatives excluding our expected cost of purchasing the hedging instruments; and        •    Changes in the fair value of the embedded derivative liabilities related to index call options we may purchase in the future to hedge contract holder index allocations applicable to future reset periods for our indexed annuity products as required under Statements of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” (“SFAS 133”) and SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements” (“SFAS 157”).      •    Income (loss) from the initial adoption of changes in accounting principles;      •    Income (loss) from reserve changes (net of related amortization) on business sold through reinsurance;      •    Losses on early retirement of debt, including subordinated debt;      •    Losses from the impairment of intangible assets; and      •    Income (loss) from discontinued operations.  Operating revenues represent GAAP revenues excluding the pre-tax effects of the following items, as applicable:      •    Excluded realized gain (loss);      •    Amortization of deferred gains arising from the reserve changes on business sold through reinsurance; and      •    Revenue adjustments from the initial impact of the adoption of changes in accounting principles.  Operating revenues and income (loss) from operations are the financial performance measures we use to evaluate and assess the results of our segments. Accordingly, we report operating revenues and income (loss) from operations by segment in Note 16. Our management and Board of Directors believe that operating revenues and income (loss) from operations explain the results of our ongoing businesses in a manner that allows for a better understanding of the underlying trends in our current businesses because the excluded items are unpredictable and not necessarily indicative of current operating fundamentals or future performance of the business segments, and, in many instances, decisions regarding these items do not necessarily relate to the operations of the individual segments. Operating revenues and income (loss) from operations do not replace revenues and net income as the GAAP measures of our consolidated results of operations.  Beginning with the quarter ended June 30, 2008, we changed our definitions of segment operating revenues and income from operations to better reflect: the underlying economics of our variable and indexed annuities that employ derivative instruments to hedge policy benefits; and the manner in which management evaluates that business. Our change in the definition of income from operations is primarily the result of our adoption of SFAS 157 during the first quarter of 2008. See Note 2. Under SFAS 157’s fair value calculation, we are required to fair value these annuities from an “exit value” perspective, (i.e., what a market participant or     38     willing buyer would charge to assume the liability). We, therefore, must include margins that a market participant buyer would require as well as a factor for non-performance risk related to our credit quality. We do not believe that these factors relate to the economics of the underlying business and do not reflect the manner in which management evaluates the business. The items that are now excluded from our operating results that were previously included are as follows: GLB net derivatives results; indexed annuity forward-starting option; and GDB derivatives results. For more information regarding this change, see our current report on Form 8-K dated July 16, 2008.  We continue to exclude the effects of any realized gain (loss) on investments from segment operating revenues and income from operations as we believe that such items are not necessarily indicative of current operating fundamentals or future performance of the business segments, and, in many instances, decisions regarding these items do not necessarily relate to the operations of the individual segments.  We believe that our new definitions of operating revenues and income (loss) from operations will provide investors with a more valuable measure of our performance because it better reveals trends in our business. See “Realized Gain (Loss)” below for more information about these items.  Certain reclassifications have been made to prior periods’ financial information. Included in these reclassifications is the change in our definition of segment operating revenues and income (loss) from operations as discussed above. In addition, we have reclassified the results of certain derivatives and embedded derivatives to realized gain (loss), which were previously reported within insurance fees, net investment income, interest credited or benefits. The associated amortization expense of deferred acquisition costs (“DAC”) and value of business acquired (“VOBA”) (previously reported within underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses), deferred sales inducements (“DSI”) (previously reported within interest credited), deferred front-end loads (“DFEL”) (previously reported within insurance fees) and changes in contract holder funds (previously reported within benefits) have also been reclassified to realized gain (loss). See Note 1 for additional information.  FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS – CAUTIONARY LANGUAGE  Certain statements made in this report and in other written or oral statements made by LNC or on LNC’s behalf are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (“PSLRA”).

     •    A decline in the equity markets causing a reduction in the sales of LNC’s products, a reduction of asset-based fees that LNC charges on various investment and insurance products, an acceleration of amortization of DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL and an increase in liabilities related to guaranteed benefit features of LNC’s variable annuity products;      •    Ineffectiveness of LNC’s various hedging strategies used to offset the impact of changes in the value of liabilities due to changes in the level and volatility of the equity markets and interest rates;      •    A deviation in actual experience regarding future persistency, mortality, morbidity, interest rates or equity market returns from LNC’s assumptions used in pricing its products, in establishing related insurance reserves and in the amortization of intangibles that may result in an increase in reserves and a decrease in net income, including as a result of stranger-originated life insurance business;    39      •    Changes in GAAP that may result in unanticipated changes to LNC’s net income, including the impact of SFAS 157 and SFAS No. 159, “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities”;      •    Lowering of one or more of LNC’s debt ratings issued by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations and the adverse impact such action may have on LNC’s ability to raise capital and on its liquidity and financial condition;      •    Lowering of one or more of the insurer financial strength ratings of LNC’s insurance subsidiaries and the adverse impact such action may have on the premium writings, policy retention and profitability of its insurance subsidiaries;      •    Significant credit, accounting, fraud or corporate governance issues that may adversely affect the value of certain investments in the portfolios of LNC’s companies requiring that LNC realize losses on such investments;      •    The impact of acquisitions and divestitures, restructurings, product withdrawals and other unusual items, including LNC’s ability to integrate acquisitions and to obtain the anticipated results and synergies from acquisitions, including LNC’s ability to successfully integrate Jefferson-Pilot Corporation (“Jefferson-Pilot”) businesses acquired on April 3, 2006, to achieve the expected synergies from the merger or to achieve such synergies within our expected timeframe;      •    The adequacy and collectibility of reinsurance that LNC has purchased;      •    Acts of terrorism, war or other man-made and natural catastrophes that may adversely affect LNC’s businesses and the cost and availability of reinsurance;      •    Competitive conditions, including pricing pressures, new product offerings and the emergence of new competitors, that may affect the level of premiums and fees that LNC can charge for its products;      •    The unknown impact on LNC’s business resulting from changes in the demographics of LNC’s client base, as aging baby-boomers move from the asset-accumulation stage to the asset-distribution stage of life;      •    Loss of key management, portfolio managers in the Investment Management segment, financial planners or wholesalers;      •    Changes in general economic or business conditions, both domestic and foreign, that may be less favorable than expected and may affect foreign exchange rates, premium levels, claims experience, the level of pension benefit costs and funding and investment results; and      •    Continued economic declines and credit market volatility that could cause us to realize additional impairments on investments and certain intangible assets and dampen future earnings.  The risks included here are not exhaustive. Other sections of this report, our 2007 Form 10-K, current reports on Form 8-K and other documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) include additional factors that could impact LNC’s business and financial performance, including “Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” and the risk discussions included in this section under “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates,” “Consolidated Investments” and “Reinsurance,” which are incorporated herein by reference. Moreover, LNC operates in a rapidly changing and competitive environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors.  Further, it is not possible to assess the impact of all risk factors on LNC’s business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results. In addition, LNC disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that occur after the date of this report.  INTRODUCTION  Executive Summary  We are a holding company that operates multiple insurance and investment management businesses through subsidiary companies. Through our business segments, we sell a wide range of wealth protection, accumulation and retirement income products and solutions. These products include institutional and/or retail fixed and indexed annuities, variable annuities, universal life insurance (“UL”), variable universal life insurance (“VUL”), linked-benefit UL, term life insurance, mutual funds and managed accounts.  As of June 30, 2008, we provided products and services in four operating businesses: Individual Markets, Employer Markets, Investment Management and Lincoln UK, and reported results through six business segments: Individual Markets – Annuities; Individual Markets – Life Insurance; Employer Markets – Retirement Products; Employer Markets – Group Protection; Investment Management; and Lincoln UK. These operating businesses and their segments are described in “Part I – Item 1. Business” of our 2007 Form 10-K. We also have Other Operations, which includes the financial data for operations that are not directly related to the business segments. Other Operations also includes the Institutional Pension business, which was previously reported in Employer Markets – Retirement Products.    40    On July 21, 2008, we announced the realignment of our segments under our former Employer Markets and Individual Markets operating businesses into two new operating businesses – Retirement Solutions and Insurance Solutions. We believe the new structure more closely aligns with consumer needs and should lead to more coordinated product development and greater effectiveness across the enterprise. The only change to our current segment reporting will be to report the results of the Executive Benefits business, which as of June 30, 2008, was part of the Retirement Products segment, in the Life Insurance segment. Accordingly, for the third quarter of 2008, we will provide products and services in four operating business and report results through six segments as follows:           Business    Corresponding Segments      Retirement Solutions   Annuities    Defined Contribution (formerly Retirement Products)      Insurance Solutions   Life Insurance (including Executive Benefits business)    Group Protection      Investment Management   Investment Management      Lincoln UK   Lincoln UK  These changes to the Retirement Products and the Life Insurance segments are in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 131, “Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information,” and reflect the manner in which we are organized for purposes of making operating decisions and assessing performance. Our segment results will be reported under this new structure beginning in the third quarter of 2008, and we will restate results from prior periods in a consistent manner. We view the changes to the existing segments as immaterial.  Current Market Conditions  During the first half of the year, the capital markets continued to experience high volatility that affected both equity market returns and interest rates. In addition, we also saw the widening of credit spreads across asset classes and reduced liquidity in the credit markets. Earnings in the second half of 2008 will be unfavorably impacted by the significant decline in the Standard & Poor’s (“S&P”) 500 Index® during June. While the average S&P 500 Index® for second quarter was higher than first quarter, the S&P 500 Index® ended June at a lower level than the average because favorable equity market performance in April and May was largely offset by unfavorable performance in June. Due to these challenges, the capital markets had a significant effect on our segment operating income and consolidated net income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2008. The markets impact primarily the following areas:  Earnings from Assets Under Management  Our asset-gathering segments: Individual Markets – Annuities; Employer Markets – Retirement Products; and Investment Management; are sensitive to the equity markets. We discuss the earnings impact of the equity markets on account values, assets under management and the related asset-based fees below in “Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – Equity Market Risk – Impact of Equity Market Sensitivity.” From the end of 2007 to June 30, 2008, the daily average value of the S&P 500 Index® decreased 7%. Solely as a result of the equity markets, our assets under management as of June 30, 2008, were down $14.1 billion from the end of the year. Strong deposits over the last year helped to more than offset this impact for the three and six months ended June 30, 2008, compared to the same periods in 2007.  Investment Income on Alternative Investments  We believe that overall market conditions in both the equity and credit markets caused our alternative investments portfolio, which consists mostly of hedge funds and various limited partnership investments, to under-perform relative to our long-term expectations and the prior periods. This impact was primarily in our Individual Markets – Life Insurance, Employer Markets – Retirement Products and Individual Markets – Annuities segments. See “Consolidated Investments – Alternative Investments” for additional information on our investment portfolio.  Variable Annuity Living Benefit Hedge Program Results  We offer variable annuity products with living benefit guarantees. These guarantees are considered embedded derivatives and are recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value under SFAS 133 and SFAS 157. Effective January 1, 2008, we adopted SFAS 157, which affected the valuation of our embedded derivatives. See Note 2 of this report for details on the adoption of SFAS 157. As described below in “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Derivatives – Guaranteed Living Benefits,” we use     41     derivative instruments to hedge our exposure to the risks and earnings volatility that result from the embedded derivatives for living benefits in certain of our variable annuity products. The change in fair value of these instruments tends to move in the opposite direction of the change in fair value of the embedded derivatives. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2008, the market conditions noted above negatively affected the net result of the change in the fair value of the living benefit embedded derivative, excluding the effect of a change in our non-performance risk factor, and the change in fair value of the hedging derivatives. The change in our non-performance risk factor used in the calculation of the embedded derivative liability had a favorable effect resulting in an overall positive outcome. These results are excluded from operating revenues and income (loss) from operations.  Credit Losses, Impairments and Unrealized Losses  Related to the our investments in fixed income and equity securities, we experienced net realized losses of $125 million and $166 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2008, which included gross write-downs of securities for other-than-temporary impairments of $120 million and $211 million, respectively. Widening spreads was the primary cause of an increase in gross unrealized losses of $1.7 billion on investments in our general account for the six months ended June 30, 2008, for our available-for-sale fixed maturity securities. These unrealized losses were concentrated in the investment grade category of investments and demonstrate how reduced liquidity in the credit markets have resulted in a decline in asset values as investors shift their investments to safer government securities, such as U.S. Treasuries.  We recorded $139 million, after-tax, of impairment of goodwill and our Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) license intangible assets on our remaining radio clusters attributable primarily to declines in advertising revenues for the entire radio market.  The effect of the negative equity markets on our assets under management in the first six months of 2008 will continue to dampen our earnings throughout 2008 even if, for the remainder of the year, the equity market returns are consistent with our long-term assumptions. Accordingly, we may continue to report lower asset-based fees relative to expectations or prior periods. The volatility and uncertainty in the capital markets will also likely result in lower than expected returns on alternative investments. In addition, a continued weakness in the economic environment could lead to increased credit defaults.  In the face of these capital market challenges, we continue to focus on building our businesses through these difficult markets and beyond by developing and introducing high quality products, expanding distribution in new and existing key accounts and channels and targeting market segments that have high growth potential while maintaining a disciplined approach to managing our expenses.  Strategic and Operational Review  Continual product development and distribution expansion are important to our ability to meet the challenges of the competitive marketplace. In February 2008, our Individual Markets – Annuities segment launched a new guaranteed withdrawal benefit (“GWB”), Lincoln Lifetime IncomeSM Advantage, which includes features such as: a reduced minimum age for lifetime income eligibility; a 5% benefit enhancement in each year an owner does not take a withdrawal; a health care benefit; and a guaranteed minimum accumulation benefit. In our Individual Markets – Life Insurance segment, we intend to launch a variable life insurance product in the third quarter of 2008 after receiving appropriate regulatory approvals. Within the mid-sized market of our Employer Markets – Retirement Products segment, in the first quarter we launched our Lincoln SmartFutureSM retirement program to fill the gap between our Alliance program and our group variable annuities.  In terms of increasing our distribution breadth, we launched variable annuity products into three large banks during the first half of 2008. In support of these and other activities, Lincoln Financial Distributors (“LFD”) increased the number of wholesalers by 9% since the end of 2007 with additional increases expected in the remainder of the year.  Challenges and Outlook  For the remainder of 2008, we expect major challenges to include:      •    Continuation of volatility in the equity and credit markets;      •    Continuation of the low interest rate environment, which creates a challenge for our products that generate investment margin profits, such as fixed annuities and UL;      •    Continuation of challenges in the economy or a recession;      •    Achieving success in our portfolio of products and marketplace acceptance of new variable annuity features that will help maintain our competitive position;      •    Continuation of the successful expansion of our wholesale distribution businesses;    42      •    Ability to improve financial and sales results and increase scale in our Employer Markets – Defined Contribution and Investment Management businesses;      •    Continuation of focus by the government on tax reform including potential changes in company dividends-received deduction calculations, which may impact our products and overall earnings;      •    Continuation of competitive pressures in the life insurance and annuity marketplace; and      •    Regulatory scrutiny of the life and annuity industry, which may lead to higher product costs and negative perceptions about the industry.  In the face of these challenges, we expect to focus on the following throughout the remainder of 2008:      •    Continue to significantly invest in expanding our distribution in each of our core Retirement Solutions, Insurance Solutions and Investment Management businesses;      •    Continue near term product development in our manufacturing units and future product development initiatives in our Retirement Income Security Venture unit related to the evolving retirement income security marketplace;      •    Explore strategies to increase scale in our Employer Markets – Defined Contribution and Investment Management businesses;      •    Further embed financial and execution discipline throughout our operations by using technology and making other investments to improve operating effectiveness and lower unit costs; and      •    Substantially complete the remaining platform and system consolidations necessary to achieve the final portion of integration cost saves as well as prepare us for more effective customer interaction in the future.  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  The MD&A included in our 2007 Form 10-K contains a detailed discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates. The following information updates the critical accounting policies and estimates provided in our 2007 Form 10-K and, accordingly, should be read in conjunction with the critical accounting policies and estimates discussed in our 2007 Form 10-K.  Adoption of SFAS No. 157 – Fair Value Measurements  We adopted SFAS 157 for all our financial instruments effective January 1, 2008. For detailed discussions of the methodologies and assumptions used to determine the fair value of our financial instruments and a summary of our financial instruments carried at fair value as of June 30, 2008, see Notes 2 and 15 of this report and Notes 1 and 19 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2007 Form 10-K.  The adoption of SFAS 157 decreased income from continuing operations by $16 million. The impact to revenue is reported in realized gain (loss) and such amount along with the associated federal income taxes is excluded from income from operations of our segments. For a detailed description of the impact of adoption on our consolidated financial statements, see Note 2.  We did not make any material changes to valuation techniques or models used to determine the fair value of our assets and liabilities carried at fair value during the three and six months ended June 30, 2008, subsequent to the adoption of SFAS 157. As part of our on-going valuation process, we assess the reasonableness of all our valuation techniques or models and make adjustments as necessary.  Our investment securities are valued using market inputs, including benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, two-sided markets, benchmark securities, bids, offers and reference data. In addition, market indicators and industry and economic events are monitored, and further market data is acquired if certain triggers are met. For certain security types, additional inputs may be used, or some of the inputs described above may not be applicable. For broker-quoted only securities, quotes from market makers or broker-dealers are obtained from sources recognized to be market participants. In order to validate the pricing information and broker/dealer quotes, we employ, where possible, procedures that include comparisons with similar observable positions, comparisons with subsequent sales, discussions with senior business leaders and brokers as well as observations of general market movements for those asset classes. It is possible that different valuation techniques and models could produce materially different estimates of fair values.  Our insurance liabilities that contain embedded derivatives are valued based on a stochastic projection of scenarios of the embedded derivative fees, benefits and expenses. The scenario assumptions, at each valuation date, are those we view to be appropriate for a hypothetical market participant and include assumptions for capital markets, actuarial lapse, benefit utilization, mortality, risk margin, administrative expenses and a margin for profit. In addition, a non-performance risk component is determined each valuation date that reflects our risk of not fulfilling the obligations of the underlying liability. The spread for the non-performance risk is added to the discount rates used in determining the fair value from the net cash flows. We believe these assumptions are consistent with those that would be used by a market participant; however, as the related markets develop we will continue to reassess our assumptions. It is possible that different valuation techniques and assumptions could produce a materially different estimate of fair value.    43    The adoption of SFAS 157 increased our exposure to earnings volatility from period to period due primarily to the inclusion of the non-performance risk into the calculation of the GLB embedded derivative liability. For additional information, see our discussion in “Realized Gain (Loss)” below.  The following summarizes the percentages of our financial instruments carried at fair value on a recurring basis by the SFAS 157 hierarchy levels:                        As of June 30, 2008        Level 1     Level 2     Level 3     TotalFairValue     Assets   1 %   90 %   9 %   100 %   Liabilities   0 %   15 %   85 %   100 %  Note: The percentages above are calculated excluding separate account assets.  Changes of our financial instruments carried at fair value and classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy result from changes in market conditions, as well as changes in our portfolio mix and increases and decreases in fair values as a result of those classifications. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2008, there were no material changes in financial instruments classified as level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. For further detail, see Note 15.  See “Consolidated Investments” below for a summary of our investments in available-for-sale securities backed by pools of residential mortgages.  Derivatives  To protect us from a variety of equity market and interest rate risks that are inherent in many of our life insurance and annuity products, we use various derivative instruments. Assessing the effectiveness of these hedging programs and evaluating the carrying values of the related derivatives often involve a variety of assumptions and estimates. We use derivatives to hedge equity market risks, interest rate risk and foreign currency exposures that are embedded in our annuity and life insurance product liabilities or investment portfolios. Derivatives held as of June 30, 2008, contain industry standard terms and are entered into with financial institutions with long-standing, superior performance records. Our accounting policies for derivatives and the potential impact on interest spreads in a falling rate environment are discussed in “Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” of this report and “Part II – Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” and Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2007 Form 10-K.  Guaranteed Living Benefits  We have a hedging strategy designed to mitigate the risk and income statement volatility caused by changes in the equity markets, interest rates and market implied volatilities associated with the Lincoln SmartSecurity® Advantage GWB feature and our i4LIFE® Advantage guaranteed income benefit (“GIB”) feature that is available in our variable annuity products. In the second quarter of 2007, we also began hedging our 4LATER® Advantage GIB feature available in our variable annuity products. These living benefit features are collectively referred to as GLBs. During 2007, we made adjustments to our hedging program to purchase longer dated volatility protection and increased our hedges related to volatility to better match liability sensitivities under SFAS 157. In addition, in early January 2008, we added the variable annuity business in our New York insurance subsidiary, with total account values of approximately $1.2 billion as of June 30, 2008, to our hedge program. In February 2008, we also added our new GWB Lincoln Lifetime IncomeSM Advantage to our hedging program.  The hedging strategy is designed such that changes in the value of the hedge contracts move in the opposite direction of changes in the value of the embedded derivative of the GWB and GIB features. This dynamic hedging strategy utilizes options on U.S.-based equity indices, futures on U.S.-based and international equity indices and variance swaps on U.S.-based equity indices, as well as interest rate futures and swaps. The notional amounts of the underlying hedge instruments are such that the magnitude of the change in the value of the hedge instruments due to changes in equity markets, interest rates and implied volatilities is designed to offset the magnitude of the change in the fair value of the GWB and GIB guarantees caused by those same factors. As of June 30, 2008, the embedded derivatives for GWB, the i4LIFE® Advantage GIB and the 4LATER® Advantage GIB were liabilities valued at $220 million, $74 million and $41 million, respectively.    44    For additional information on our hedging results, see our discussion in “Realized Gain (Loss)” below.  Acquisitions and Dispositions  Dispositions  Media Business  On June 7, 2007, we announced plans to explore strategic options for our former business segment, Lincoln Financial Media. During the fourth quarter of 2007, we decided to divest our television and Charlotte radio broadcasting and sports programming businesses, and, on November 12, 2007, we signed agreements to sell them. The divestiture of the sports programming business closed on November 30, 2007, the Charlotte radio broadcasting business closed on January 31, 2008, and the television broadcasting business closed on March 31, 2008. Accordingly, we have reported the results of these businesses as discontinued operations on our Consolidated Statements of Income and the assets and liabilities as held for sale on our Consolidated Balance Sheets for all periods presented. We continue to actively manage our investment in our remaining radio clusters, which are now being reported within Other Operations, to maximize station performance and future valuation. For additional information, see Note 3.  The proceeds from the sales of the above media properties were used for repurchase of shares, repayment of debt and other strategic initiatives.  The results of operations of these businesses have been reclassified into income from discontinued operations for all periods presented on the Consolidated Statements of Income. The amounts (in millions) related to operations of these businesses, included in income from discontinued operations, were as follows:                               For the ThreeMonths EndedJune 30,   Change     For the SixMonths EndedJune 30,   Change        2008   2007     2008     2007     Discontinued Operations Before Disposal                            Media revenues, net of agency commissions   $ —    $ 29   -100 %   $ 22     $ 71   -69 %                                       Income from discontinued operations before disposal, before federal income taxes   $ —    $ 10   -100 %   $ 8     $ 22   -64 %   Federal income taxes     —      4   -100 %     3       8   -63 %                                       Income from discontinued operations before disposal     —      6   -100 %     5       14   -64 %                                       Disposal                            Loss on disposal, before federal income taxes     —      —    NM       (12 )     —    NM     Federal income tax benefit     —      —    NM       (3 )     —    NM                                         Loss on disposal     —      —    NM       (9 )     —    NM                                         Income (loss) from discontinued operations   $ —    $ 6   -100 %   $ (4 )   $ 14   NM                                        During the first quarter of 2008, we adjusted our loss on disposal of discontinued media properties due primarily to changes in the net assets disposed of for the television broadcasting business.  Fixed Income Investment Management Business  During the fourth quarter of 2007, we sold certain institutional taxable fixed income business to an unaffiliated investment management company. Investment Management transferred $12.3 billion of assets under management as part of this transaction. Based upon the assets transferred as of October 31, 2007, the purchase price is expected to be no more than $49 million. We expect this transaction to decrease income from operations, compared to the corresponding periods in 2007, by approximately $3 million, after-tax, per quarter in 2008.  During the fourth quarter of 2007, we received $25 million of the purchase price, with additional scheduled payments over the next three years. During 2007, we recorded an after-tax realized loss of $2 million on our Consolidated Statements of Income as a result     45     of goodwill we attributed to this business. There were certain other pipeline accounts in process at the time of the transaction closing, and any adjustment to the purchase price, if necessary, will be determined at October 31, 2008. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2008, we recorded an after-tax gain of $1 million and $3 million, respectively, on our Consolidated Statements of Income related to this transaction.

The causes of decreases in net income were partially offset by:      •    Growth in insurance fees driven by increases in life insurance in force as a result of new sales since June 30, 2007, and favorable persistency along with increases in variable account values from positive net flows partially offset by adjustments during the second quarter of 2007 resulting from adjusting account values for certain of our life insurance policies and modifying the accounting for certain of our life insurance policies;      •    Lower litigation and merger-related expenses;      •    Lower incentive compensation accruals as a result of lower earnings and production performance relative to planned goals;      •    The results in the second quarter of 2007 included an $8 million expense for an increase in reserves (net of related deferred gain amortization) on the personal accident business that was sold to Swiss Re through an indemnity reinsurance transaction in 2001;      •    Lower broker-dealer expenses driven by lower sales; and      •    Favorable benefit reserve adjustments in the second quarter of 2008 for our Lincoln UK segment.  In addition to the items discussed above, net income for the six months ended June 30, 2008, compared to the same period in 2007 was affected by:      •    A $14 million reduction in benefits in the first quarter of 2007 related to a purchase accounting adjustment to the opening balance sheet of Jefferson-Pilot;      •    A $16 million effect of the initial adoption of SFAS 157 on January 1, 2008;      •    Higher interest and debt expenses from increased debt; and      •    The first quarter of 2008 adjustment to our loss on disposition of our discontinued operations.  The foregoing items are discussed in further detail in results of operations by segment discussions and “Realized Gain (Loss)” below.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – Equity Market Risk – Impact of Equity Market Sensitivity.”    49    RESULTS OF INDIVIDUAL MARKETS  The Individual Markets business provides its products through two segments: Annuities and Life Insurance. Through its Annuities segment, Individual Markets provides tax-deferred investment growth and lifetime income opportunities for its clients by offering individual fixed annuities, including indexed annuities, and variable annuities. The Life Insurance segment offers wealth protection and transfer opportunities through term insurance, a linked-benefit product (which is a UL policy linked with riders that provide for long-term care costs) and both single and survivorship versions of UL and VUL.  Individual Markets – Annuities  Income from Operations  Details underlying the results for Individual Markets – Annuities (in millions) were as follows:                              For the ThreeMonths EndedJune 30,   Change     For the SixMonths EndedJune 30,   Change        2008   2007     2008   2007     Operating Revenues                           Insurance premiums   $ 19   $ 17   12 %   $ 51   $ 29   76 %   Insurance fees     257     244   5 %     503     465   8 %   Net investment income     245     265   -8 %     493     531   -7 %   Operating realized gain     12     1   NM       23     2   NM     Other revenues and fees     85     97   -12 %     171     187   -9 %                                     Total operating revenues     618     624   -1 %     1,241     1,214   2 %                                     Operating Expenses                           Interest credited     163     165   -1 %     325     326   0 %   Benefits     35     27   30 %     87     52   67 %   Underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses     268     267   0 %     520     517   1 %                                     Total operating expenses     466     459   2 %     932     895   4 %                                     Income from operations before taxes     152     165   -8 %     309     319   -3 %   Federal income taxes     36     42   -14 %     75     79   -5 %                                     Income from operations   $ 116   $ 123   -6 %   $ 234   $ 240   -3 %                                    Comparison of the Three and Six Months Ended June 30, 2008 to 2007  Income from operations for this segment decreased due primarily to a decrease in net investment income from lower earnings on surplus investments and alternative investments due to unfavorable equity markets.  The decrease in income from operations was partially offset by growth in insurance fees attributable to increases in variable annuity account values from positive net flows partially offset by the increase in attributed fees. The positive net flows served to mitigate the negative effect on fees from the decline in account values driven by the unfavorable performance of the equity markets.  The decrease in income from operations is discussed further below.

These assessments are a function of the rates priced into the product and the average daily variable account values. Average daily account values are driven by net flows and equity markets. In addition, for our fixed annuity contracts and for some variable contracts, we collect surrender charges when contract holders surrender their contracts during their surrender charge periods to protect us from premature withdrawals. Insurance fees include charges on both our variable and fixed annuity products, but exclude the attributed fees on our GLB products. The attributed fees are the portion of rider charges used in the calculation of the embedded derivative and represent net valuation premium plus a margin that a theoretical market participant would include for risk/profit, including a non-performance risk factor required by SFAS 157. Net valuation premium represents a level portion of rider fees required to fund potential claims for the living benefit. Operating realized gain is the attributed fees less the net valuation premium, net of the associated amortization expense of DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL.  New deposits are an important component of our effort to grow the annuity business. Although deposits do not significantly impact current period income from operations, they are an important indicator of future profitability.  The other component of net flows relates to the retention of the business. One of the key assumptions in pricing a product is the account persistency, which we refer to as the lapse rate. The lapse rate compares the amount of withdrawals to the average account values.  Comparison of the Three and Six Months Ended June 30, 2008 to 2007  The growth in expense assessments was attributable to an increase in average daily variable annuity account values. The increase in account values reflects cumulative positive net flows, which offset the reduction in variable account values from unfavorable equity markets in the three and six months ended June 30, 2008.  In the past several years, we have concentrated our efforts on expanding both product and distribution breadth. Annuity deposits increased as a result of continued strong sales of products with GLB riders and the expansion of the wholesaling force in LFD.  Overall lapse rates for the three and six months ended June 30, 2008, were 8% compared to 10% for the same periods in 2007.    52    Net Investment Income and Interest Credited  Details underlying net investment income, interest credited (in millions) and our interest rate spread were as follows:                                  For the ThreeMonths EndedJune 30,     Change     For the SixMonths EndedJune 30,     Change        2008     2007       2008     2007       Net Investment Income                               Fixed maturity securities, mortgage loans on real estate and other, net of investment expenses   $ 224     $ 229     -2 %   $ 453     $ 467     -3 %   Commercial mortgage loan prepayment and bond makewhole premiums (1)     —        3     -100 %     1       5     -80 %   Alternative investments (2)     —        1     -100 %     (1 )     2     NM     Surplus investments (3)     20       31     -35 %     38       54     -30 %   Broker-dealer     1       1     0 %     2       3     -33 %                                             Total net investment income   $ 245     $ 265     -8 %   $ 493     $ 531     -7 %                                             Interest Credited                               Amount provided to contract holders   $ 180     $ 184     -2 %   $ 363     $ 367     -1 %   Opening balance sheet adjustment (4)     —        —      NM       —        (4 )   100 %   DSI deferrals     (26 )     (27 )   4 %     (52 )     (51 )   -2 %                                             Interest credited before DSI amortization     154       157     -2 %     311       312     0 %   DSI amortization:                               Excluding unlocking     9       9     0 %     15       16     -6 %   Retrospective unlocking     —        (1 )   100 %     (1 )     (2 )   50 %                                             Total interest credited   $ 163     $ 165     -1 %   $ 325     $ 326     0 %                                                 (1)  See “Consolidated Investments – Commercial Mortgage Loan Prepayment and Bond Makewhole Premiums” below for additional information.

We expect to earn a spread between what we earn on the underlying general account investments supporting the fixed annuity product line, including the fixed portion of variable annuity contracts, and what we credit to our fixed annuity contract holders’ accounts, including the fixed portion of variable annuity contracts. The interest rate spread for this segment represents the excess of the yield on invested assets on reserves over the average crediting rate. The yield on invested assets on reserves is calculated as net investment income, excluding the amounts attributable to our surplus investments, reverse repurchase agreement interest expense, inter-segment cash management account interest expense and interest on collateral divided by average invested assets on reserves. The average invested assets on reserves is calculated based upon total invested assets, excluding hedge derivatives and collateral. The average crediting rate is calculated as interest credited before DSI amortization, plus the immediate annuity reserve change (included within benefits) divided by the average fixed account values, including the fixed portion of variable, net of coinsured account values. Fixed account values reinsured under modified coinsurance agreements are included in account values for this calculation. Changes in commercial mortgage loan prepayments and bond makewhole premiums, investment income on alternative investments and surplus investment income can vary significantly from period to period due to a number of factors and, therefore, may contribute to investment income results that are not indicative of the underlying trends.  We expect to manage the effect of spreads for near-term income from operations through a combination of rate actions and portfolio management. Our expectation includes the assumption that there are no significant changes in net flows in or out of our fixed accounts or other changes that may cause interest rate spreads to differ from our expectation. For information on interest rate spreads and the interest rate risk due to falling interest rates, see “Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.”  Comparison of the Three and Six Months Ended June 30, 2008 to 2007  The decline in surplus investment income was attributable to less favorable investment income on alternative investments.  The decline in investment income from fixed maturity securities, mortgage loans on real estate and other net investment income was due primarily to a decrease in fixed account values, including the fixed portion of variable, which included a $300 million funding agreement that matured on June 2, 2008. Interest credited to contract holders remained relatively flat as a decline in our fixed account values, including the fixed portion of variable, was offset by an elevated rate.  Our fixed annuity business includes products with crediting rates that are reset on an annual basis and are not subject to surrender charges. Account values for these products were $5.1 billion as of June 30, 2008, with 42% already at their minimum guaranteed rates. The average crediting rates for these products were approximately 41 basis points in excess of average minimum guaranteed rates. Our ability to retain annual reset annuities will be subject to current competitive conditions at the time interest rates for these products reset. In addition to the separate items identified in the interest rate spread table above, the other component of the interest rate credited to contract holders decreased due primarily to a roll-off of multi-year guarantee and annual reset annuities with higher interest rates.    54    Benefits  Comparison of the Three and Six Months Ended June 30, 2008 to 2007  The increase in benefits was attributable to an unfavorable variance in the SOP 03-1 benefit ratio unlocking, which was offset by changes in the value of the derivative included in operating realized gain, as well as an increase in reserves for single premium immediate annuities, which had a corresponding increase in insurance premiums.

We have certain trail commissions that are based upon account values that are expensed as incurred rather than being deferred and amortized.  Broker-dealer expenses that vary with and are related to sales are expensed as incurred and not deferred and amortized. These expenses are more than offset by increases to other income.  Comparison of the Three Months Ended June 30, 2008 to 2007  The increase in expenses incurred, excluding broker-dealer, was attributable primarily to growth in account values from sales, which increased commissions and general and administrative expenses.  The decrease in broker-dealer commissions was due to lower sales of non-proprietary products.  The second quarter of 2007 had favorable retrospective unlocking (decrease to DAC and VOBA amortization) due primarily to lower lapses and higher equity market returns than estimated in our model projections.    55    Comparison of the Six Months Ended June 30, 2008 to 2007  The increase in expenses incurred, excluding broker-dealer, was attributable primarily to growth in account values from sales, which increased commissions and general and administrative expenses.  The decrease in broker-dealer commissions was due to lower sales of non-proprietary products. The increase in broker-dealer general and administrative expenses was attributable primarily to increases in personnel costs.  The first six months of 2007 had favorable retrospective unlocking (decrease to DAC and VOBA amortization) due primarily to lower lapses and higher equity market returns than estimated in our model projections.

The decrease in income from operations was partially offset by the following:      •    Growth in insurance fees driven by an increase in business in force as a result of new sales since June 30, 2007, and favorable persistency partially offset by the impact on insurance fees from lower sales in the second quarter of 2008 compared to the second quarter of 2007 and adjustments during the second quarter of 2007 resulting from adjusting account values for certain of our life insurance policies and modifying the accounting for certain of our life insurance policies.    56    Comparison of the Six Months Ended June 30, 2008 to 2007  Income from operations for this segment decreased due primarily to the following:      •    Higher death claims in 2008 and lower benefits in the first quarter of 2007 partially related to a $14 million reduction in benefits related to a purchase accounting adjustment to the opening balance sheet of Jefferson-Pilot;      •    Lower net investment income from a reduction in statutory reserves as a result of the merger of several of our insurance subsidiaries and certain assumption changes in the fourth quarter of 2007, capital transactions providing relief from AG38 reserve requirements in the fourth quarter of 2007 and less favorable results from our investment income on alternative investments and prepayment and bond makewhole premiums; and      •    A decrease attributable to unfavorable retrospective unlocking of DAC and VOBA for the first six months of 2008 compared to favorable retrospective unlocking for the first six months of 2007.  The decrease in income from operations was partially offset by the following:      •    Growth in insurance fees driven by an increase in business in force as a result of new sales since June 30, 2007, and favorable persistency partially offset by the impact on insurance fees from lower sales in the first six months of 2008 compared to the first six months of 2007 and adjustments during the second quarter of 2007 resulting from adjusting account values for certain of our life insurance policies and modifying the accounting for certain of our life insurance policies.  The foregoing items are discussed further below.  Insurance Premiums  Insurance premiums relate to traditional products and are a function of the rates priced into the product and the level of insurance in force. Insurance in force, in turn, is driven by sales, persistency and mortality experience.  Comparison of the Three and Six Months Ended June 30, 2008 to 2007  Traditional in-force face amount and thus premiums remained relatively flat.  Insurance Fees  Details underlying insurance fees, sales, net flows, account values and in-force face amount (in millions) were as follows:                                  For the ThreeMonths EndedJune 30,           For the SixMonths EndedJune 30,              2008     2007     Change     2008     2007     Change     Insurance Fees                               Mortality assessments   $ 321     $ 282     14 %   $ 633     $ 575     10 %   Expense assessments     164       148     11 %     330       301     10 %   Surrender charges     15       16     -6 %     31       31     0 %   DFEL:                               Deferrals     (89 )     (112 )   21 %     (177 )     (178 )   1 %   Amortization, excluding unlocking     38       41     -7 %     73       68     7 %   Retrospective unlocking     11       (7 )   257 %     15       (10 )   250 %                                             Total insurance fees   $ 460     $ 368     25 %   $ 905     $ 787     15 %                                              57                                  For the ThreeMonths EndedJune 30,           For the SixMonths EndedJune 30,              2008     2007     Change     2008     2007     Change     Sales by Product                               UL:                               Excluding MoneyGuard ®   $ 124     $ 145     -14 %   $ 237     $ 311     -24 %   MoneyGuard ®     12       10     20 %     23       17     35 %                                             Total UL     136       155     -12 %     260       328     -21 %   VUL     12       17     -29 %     27       38     -29 %   Term/whole life     5       8     -38 %     11       17     -35 %                                             Total sales   $ 153     $ 180     -15 %   $ 298     $ 383     -22 %                                             Net Flows                               Deposits   $ 952     $ 1,005     -5 %   $ 1,919     $ 2,044     -6 %   Withdrawals and deaths     (325 )     (419 )   22 %     (712 )     (761 )   6 %                                             Net flows   $ 627     $ 586     7 %   $ 1,207     $ 1,283     -6 %                                             Contract holder assessments   $ 675     $ 586     15 %   $ 1,318     $ 1,188     11 %                                                               As of June 30,   Change        2008   2007     Account Values               UL   $ 21,321   $ 20,261   5 %   VUL     4,473     4,948   -10 %   Interest-sensitive whole life     2,283     2,256   1 %                     Total account values   $ 28,077   $ 27,465   2 %                     In-Force Face Amount               UL and other   $ 288,668   $ 276,040   5 %   Term insurance     234,109     236,155   -1 %                     Total in-force face amount   $ 522,777   $ 512,195   2 %                    Insurance fees relate only to interest-sensitive products and include mortality assessments, expense assessments (net of deferrals and amortization related to DFEL) and surrender charges. Mortality and expense assessments are deducted from our contract holders’ account values. These amounts are a function of the rates priced into the product and premiums received, face amount in force and account values. Insurance in force, in turn, is driven by sales, persistency and mortality experience. In-force growth should be considered independently with respect to term products versus UL and other products, as term products have a lower profitability relative to face amount compared to whole life and interest-sensitive products.  Sales in the table above and as discussed below were reported as follows:       •    UL, VUL, MoneyGuard® – 100% of annualized expected target premiums plus 5% of paid excess premiums, including an adjustment for internal replacements at approximately 50% of target; and      •    Whole life and term – 100% of first year paid premiums.  Sales are not recorded as a component of revenues (other than for traditional products) and do not have a significant impact on current quarter income from operations but are indicators of future profitability.  We have screening procedures to identify sales that we believe have characteristics associated with stranger-originated life insurance in order to prevent policies with these characteristics from being issued. However, accurate identification of these policies can be difficult, and we continue to modify our screening procedures. We believe that our sales of UL products include some sales with stranger-originated life insurance characteristics. We expect no significant impact to our profitability; however, returns on UL business sold as part of stranger-originated designs are believed to be lower than traditional estate planning UL sales due in part to no expected lapses.    58    UL and VUL products with secondary guarantees represented approximately 33% of interest-sensitive life insurance in force as of June 30, 2008, and approximately 77% and 76% of sales for the three and six months ended June 30, 2008. AG38 imposes additional statutory reserve requirements for these products. See “Review of Consolidated Financial Condition – Liquidity and Capital Resources – Sources of Liquidity and Cash Flow” for further information on the manner in which we reinsure our AG38 reserves.  Comparison of the Three and Six Months Ended June 30, 2008 to 2007  The growth in mortality and expense assessments was attributable primarily to the impact of a $41 million reduction in insurance fees, net of DFEL amortization, related to the impact of the correction to account values and modification of accounting related to certain insurance contracts during the second quarter of 2007. In addition, mortality and expense assessments grew as a result of increased life insurance in force and account values from new sales since June 30, 2007, an increase in the average attained age of the in-force block (which also led to increases in benefits as discussed below) and favorable persistency.  The second quarter of 2008 had favorable retrospective unlocking (increase to DFEL amortization) due primarily to lower premiums received and higher death claims, partially offset by higher investment income on alternative investments and prepayment and bond makewhole premiums and lower maintenance expenses than estimated in our model projections.  The second quarter of 2007 had unfavorable retrospective unlocking (decrease to DFEL amortization) due primarily to higher investment income on alternative investments and prepayment and bond makewhole premiums, higher premiums received and lower maintenance expenses than estimated in our model projections, partially offset by the impact of the correction to account values in the second quarter of 2007 mentioned above.  The first six months of 2008 had favorable retrospective unlocking (increase to DFEL amortization) due primarily to lower premiums received and higher death claims than estimated in our model projections and model adjustments on certain life insurance policies, partially offset by lower maintenance expenses than estimated in our model projections.  The first six months of 2007 had unfavorable retrospective unlocking (decrease to DFEL amortization) due primarily to higher investment income on alternative investments and prepayment and bond makewhole premiums, higher premiums received and lower maintenance expenses than estimated in our model projections, partially offset by the impact of the correction to account values in the second quarter of 2007 mentioned above.

Invested assets will typically grow at a faster rate than account values because of the AG38 reserve requirements. Invested assets are also affected by various reserve adjustments, primarily the result of the merger of several of our insurance subsidiaries, the modification of accounting for certain of our life insurance policies, and by capital transactions providing relief from AG38 reserve requirements, which leads to a transfer of invested assets for other corporate purposes. We expect to earn a spread between what we earn on the underlying general account investments and what we credit to our contract holders’ accounts. The interest rate spread for this segment represents the excess of the yield on invested assets on reserves over the average crediting rate on interest sensitive products. The yield on invested assets on reserves is calculated as net investment income, excluding amounts attributable to our surplus investments and reverse repurchase agreement interest expense, divided by average invested assets on reserves. In addition, we exclude the impact of earnings from affordable housing tax credit securities, which is reflected as a reduction to federal income tax expense, from our spread calculations. Traditional products use interest income to build the policy reserves. Commercial mortgage loan prepayments and bond makewhole premiums and investment income on alternative investments can vary significantly from period to period due to a number of factors, and, therefore, may contribute to investment income results that are not indicative of the underlying trends.    60    Comparison of the Three Months Ended June 30, 2008 to 2007  The increase in fixed maturity securities, mortgage loans on real estate and other net investment income was due to continued growth of business in force partially offset by the impact of reductions in statutory reserves. The decrease in investment income on alternative investments was driven primarily by less favorable results from limited partnership investments. Higher AG38 statutory reserve liabilities on UL policies with secondary guarantees contributed to invested asset growth. At June 30, 2007, we reduced statutory reserves related to our secondary guarantee UL products by approximately $150 million, which has reduced the amount of net investment income allocated to this segment by $2 million per quarter. This statutory reserve reduction related to modifying the accounting for certain of our life insurance policies. In October 2007, we released approximately $300 million of capital that had previously supported our UL products with secondary guarantees as a result of executing on a capital transaction to provide AG38 relief. This release of capital lowered the level of assets supporting this business and has reduced net investment income by approximately $5 million per quarter. As of December 31, 2007, we reduced statutory reserves related primarily to legal entity consolidation by $344 million, which has reduced the amount of net investment income allocated to this segment by approximately $5 million in the first quarter of 2008. This reduction in statutory reserves was primarily a result of the merger of several of our insurance subsidiaries.  The increase in interest credited was attributable primarily to growth in UL account values. On June 1, 2007, we implemented a 10 basis point decrease in crediting rates on most interest-sensitive products not already at contractual guarantees, which has increased spreads approximately 5 basis points. On June 1, 2008, we implemented a 10 basis point decrease in crediting rates on most interest-sensitive products not already at contractual guarantees, which is expected to increase future spreads by approximately 5 basis points.  At the end of the second quarter of 2008, new money rates exceeded the portfolio rate by roughly 16 basis points. At the end of the second quarter of 2007, new money rates exceeded the portfolio rate by roughly 10 basis points. As of June 30, 2008, 54% of interest-sensitive account values have crediting rates at contract guaranteed levels, and 36% have crediting rates within 50 basis points of contractual guarantees. Going forward, we expect to be able to manage the effects of spreads on near-term income from operations through a combination of rate actions and portfolio management, which assumes no significant changes in net flows into or out of our fixed accounts or other changes that may cause interest rate spreads to differ from our expectations. For information on interest rate spreads and the interest rate risk due to falling interest rates, see “Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.”  Comparison of the Six Months Ended June 30, 2008 to 2007  The increase in fixed maturity securities, mortgage loans on real estate and other net investment income was due to continued growth of business in force partially offset by the impact of reductions in statutory reserves.

In addition, benefits include the change in reserves for our products with secondary guarantees. The reserve for secondary guarantees is impacted by changes in expected future trends of claims and assessments causing unlocking adjustments to this liability similar to DAC, VOBA and DFEL.  Comparison of the Three Months Ended June 30, 2008 to 2007  The increase in benefits was due primarily to growth in business in force, higher mortality due to an increase in the average attained age of the in-force block (which also led to increases in insurance fees as discussed above) and an increase in reserves for products with secondary guarantees.  An adjustment to account values and modification of accounting related to certain life insurance policies in the second quarter of 2007 increased reserves for products with secondary guarantees. In the third quarter of 2007, we had an unfavorable prospective unlocking that also resulted in an increase in reserves for products with secondary guarantees. As a result of these changes, we have experienced an increase in reserves of approximately $4 million.  Comparison of the Six Months Ended June 30, 2008 to 2007  The increase in benefits was due primarily to growth in business in force, higher mortality due to an increase in the average attained age of the in-force block (which also led to increases in insurance fees as discussed above) and an increase in reserves for products with secondary guarantees, partially offset by a $14 million increase to benefits in the first quarter of 2007 related to a purchase accounting adjustment to the opening balance sheet of Jefferson-Pilot.

For our traditional products, DAC and VOBA are amortized on either a straight-line basis or as a level percent of premium of the related contracts, depending on the block of business.    62    Comparison of the Three Months Ended June 30, 2008 to 2007  The decrease in expenses incurred was primarily a result of lower sales. The increase in DAC and VOBA amortization, excluding unlocking, was due partially to business growth and the impact from the rise in the ratio of deferrable expenses to EGPs from unfavorable unlocking.  The second quarter of 2008 had unfavorable retrospective unlocking (increase to DAC and VOBA amortization) due primarily to lower premiums received and higher death claims, partially offset by higher investment income on alternative investments and prepayment and bond makewhole premiums and lower maintenance expenses than estimated in our model projections.  The second quarter of 2007 had favorable retrospective unlocking (decrease to DAC and VOBA amortization) due primarily to higher investment income on alternative investments and prepayment and bond makewhole premiums, higher premiums received and lower maintenance expenses than estimated in our model projections, partially offset by the impact of the correction to account values in the second quarter of 2007 mentioned above.  Comparison of the Six Months Ended June 30, 2008 to 2007  The decrease in expenses incurred was primarily a result of lower sales. The increase in DAC and VOBA amortization, excluding unlocking, for the three months ended June 30, 2008, as compared to the corresponding period in 2007 as discussed above was offset by lower DAC and VOBA amortization due to less favorable investment income during the six months ended June 30, 2008, as compared to the corresponding period in 2007 and the impact of an adjustment to the opening balance sheet of Jefferson-Pilot, which increased DAC and VOBA amortization for the three months ended March 31, 2007, by $10 million.  The first six months of 2008 had unfavorable retrospective unlocking (increase to DAC and VOBA amortization) due primarily to lower premiums received and higher death claims than estimated in our model projections and model adjustments on certain life insurance policies, partially offset by lower maintenance expenses than estimated in our model projections.  The first six months of 2007 had favorable retrospective unlocking (decrease to DAC and VOBA amortization) due primarily to higher investment income on alternative investments and prepayment and bond makewhole premiums, higher premiums received and lower maintenance expenses than estimated in our model projections, partially offset by the impact of the correction to account values in the second quarter of 2007 mentioned above.    63    RESULTS OF EMPLOYER MARKETS  The Employer Markets business provides its products through two segments: Retirement Products and Group Protection. The Retirement Products segment operates through two lines of business – Defined Contribution, which provides employer-sponsored variable and fixed annuities, and mutual-fund based programs in the 401(k), 403(b) and 457 marketplaces, and Executive Benefits, which provides corporate-owned life insurance (“COLI”) and bank-owned life insurance (“BOLI”). Our Institutional Pension business, which was previously reported as part of the Retirement Products segment, is now being reported in Other Operations. The Group Protection segment of Employer Markets offers group life, disability and dental insurance to employers.

A substantial increase in new deposit production in other products is necessary to maintain earnings at current levels, and increased uncertainty in the market has weakened the overall outlook.

Expense assessments are generally equal to a percentage of the daily variable account values. Our expense assessments include fees we earn for the services that we provide to our mutual fund programs. In addition, we collect surrender charges when contract holders surrender their contracts during the surrender charge periods to protect us from premature withdrawals.  New deposits are an important component of our effort to grow our business. Although deposits do not significantly impact current period income from operations, they are an important indicator of future profitability. The other component of net flows relates to the retention of our business as demonstrated by our lapse rates.  We serve the mid-large case 401(k) and 403(b) markets with our mutual fund programs. Our programs bundle our fixed annuity products with mutual funds, along with record keeping and employee education components. The amounts associated with the mutual fund programs are not included in the assets or liabilities reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.  The distribution model for the micro-small case 401(k) market is focused on driving growth through financial intermediaries. As of June 30, 2008, we had 68 wholesalers in place to support this business and plan for additional growth in the second half of 2008. We are beginning to experience an increase in new business activity as a result of building our own wholesaling force for this market.  Comparison of the Three Months Ended June 30, 2008 to 2007  The decrease in expense assessments was driven by lower average daily variable annuity account values due to unfavorable equity markets.  Deposits in our mid-large segment (including mutual fund program fixed annuity deposits) increased due to an increase in the number of mutual fund program accounts, which resulted in both an increase in initial deposits and an increase in ongoing periodic deposits.    68    The overall lapse rate for our annuity products was 13% for the second quarter of 2008 compared to 15% for the same period in 2007. The return on assets, calculated as income divided by average assets under management, for Multi-Fund® and Other Variable Annuities, our oldest block of annuity business, is more than two times that of new deposits. Therefore, a substantial increase in new deposit production in other products is necessary to maintain earnings at current levels.  As of June 30, 2008, approximately $13.2 billion, or 59%, of variable annuity contract account values contained a return of premium death benefit feature, and the net amount at risk related to these contracts was $27 million. The remaining variable annuity contract account values contain no GDB feature.  Comparison of the Six Months Ended June 30, 2008 to 2007  The decrease in expense assessments was driven by lower average daily variable annuity account values due to unfavorable equity markets.  Deposits in our mid-large segment (including mutual fund program fixed annuity deposits) increased due to an increase in the number of mutual fund program accounts, which resulted in both an increase in initial deposits and an increase in ongoing periodic deposits.  The overall lapse rate for our annuity products remained flat at 15%.

We expect to earn a spread between what we earn on the underlying general account investments supporting the fixed annuity product line, including the fixed portion of variable annuity contracts, and what we credit to our fixed annuity contract holders’ accounts, including the fixed portion of variable annuity contracts. The interest rate spread for this segment represents the excess of the yield on invested assets on reserves over the average crediting rate. The yield on invested assets on reserves is calculated as net investment income, excluding the amounts attributable to our surplus investments, reverse repurchase agreement interest expense, inter-segment cash management account interest expense and interest on collateral, divided by average invested assets on reserves. The average invested assets on reserves are calculated based upon total invested assets, excluding hedge derivatives. The average crediting rate is calculated as interest credited before DSI amortization, plus the immediate annuity reserve change (included within benefits), divided by the average fixed account values, including the fixed portion of variable annuities. Commercial mortgage loan prepayments and bond makewhole premiums, investment income on alternative investments and surplus investment income can vary significantly from period to period due to a number of factors and, therefore, may contribute to investment income results that are not indicative of the underlying trends.  Comparison of the Three Months Ended June 30, 2008 to 2007  The decline in surplus investment income was attributable to less favorable investment income on alternative investments.  The modest increase in fixed maturity securities, mortgage loans on real estate and other net investment income was attributable to the growth in the average fixed account values, including the fixed portion of variable, driven by transfers from variable annuities partially offset by the yield decline due to lower reinvestment rates. During the second quarter of 2008, in response to the competitive environment, we held credit rates constant and reduced new money rates by 25 basis points for Multi-Fund® and mutual fund products. We have taken further crediting rate actions in the third quarter of 2008, with the expectation of maintaining stable spreads over the near term, excluding the effects of prepayment and makewhole premiums. For information on interest rate spreads and the interest rate risk due to falling interest rates, see “Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.”    70    Comparison of the Six Months Ended June 30, 2008 to 2007  The decline in surplus investment income was attributable to less favorable investment income on alternative investments.  While fixed maturity securities, mortgage loans on real estate and other net investment income remained flat, the yield declined due to lower reinvestment rates, which was offset by the increase in average fixed account values, including the fixed portion of variable, driven by transfers from variable annuities.  Underwriting, Acquisition, Insurance and Other Expenses  Details underlying underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses (in millions) were as follows:                                  For the ThreeMonths EndedJune 30,           For the SixMonths EndedJune 30,              2008     2007     Change     2008     2007     Change     Underwriting, Acquisition, Insurance and Other Expenses                               Commissions   $ 19     $ 21     -10 %   $ 39     $ 41     -5 %   General and administrative expenses     52       55     -5 %     104       105     -1 %   Taxes, licenses and fees     3       4     -25 %     7       9     -22 %                                             Total expenses incurred     74       80     -8 %     150       155     -3 %   DAC deferrals     (22 )     (21 )   -5 %     (45 )     (45 )   0 %                                             Total expenses recognized before amortization     52       59     -12 %     105       110     -5 %   DAC and VOBA amortization, net of interest:                               Retrospective unlocking     —        2     -100 %     3       2     50 %   Other amortization     23       20     15 %     44       40     10 %                                             Total underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses   $ 75     $ 81     -7 %   $ 152     $ 152     0 %                                             DAC deferrals                               As a percentage of sales/deposits     1.5 %     1.6 %         1.5 %     1.6 %      Commissions and other costs, that vary with and are related primarily to the production of new business, excluding those associated with our mutual fund products, are deferred to the extent recoverable and are amortized over the lives of the contracts in relation to EGPs. We do not pay commissions on sales of our mutual fund products, and distribution expenses associated with the sale of these mutual fund products are not deferred and amortized, as is the case for our insurance products.  Comparison of the Three Months Ended June 30, 2008 to 2007  The decrease in underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses was due in part to the implementation of several expense management controls and practices that are focused on aggressively managing expenses and lower incentive compensation accruals as a result of lower earnings and production performance relative to planned goals.  The second quarter of 2007 had unfavorable retrospective unlocking (increase to DAC and VOBA amortization) due primarily to higher lapses than estimated in our model projections.  Comparison of the Six Months Ended June 30, 2008 to 2007  The first six months of 2008 and 2007 had unfavorable retrospective unlocking (increase to DAC and VOBA amortization) due primarily to higher lapses than estimated in our model projections.    71    Retirement Products – Executive Benefits  Income from Operations  Details underlying the results for Retirement Products – Executive Benefits (in millions) were as follows:                              For the ThreeMonths EndedJune 30,         For the SixMonths EndedJune 30,            2008   2007   Change     2008   2007   Change     Operating Revenues                           Insurance fees   $ 13   $ 13   0 %   $ 26   $ 26   0 %   Net investment income     52     53   -2 %     105     109   -4 %                                     Total operating revenues     65     66   -2 %     131     135   -3 %                                     Operating Expenses                           Interest credited     38     37   3 %     77     76   1 %   Benefits     4     3   33 %     6     5   20 %   Underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses     6     9   -33 %     13     19   -32 %                                     Total operating expenses     48     49   -2 %     96     100   -4 %                                     Income from operations before taxes     17     17   0 %     35     35   0 %   Federal income taxes     6     6   0 %     12     12   0 %                                     Income from operations   $ 11   $ 11   0 %   $ 23   $ 23   0 %                                    Comparison of the Three Months Ended June 30, 2008 to 2007  Income from operations remained flat as lower earnings on surplus investments due to unfavorable equity markets and increased interest credited driven by modest fixed account fund value growth were offset by lower DAC and VOBA amortization expense due to unfavorable retrospective unlocking in the second quarter of 2007.  Comparison of the Six Months Ended June 30, 2008 to 2007  Income from operations remained flat as lower earnings on surplus investments due to unfavorable equity markets and lower consent fees were offset by lower DAC and VOBA amortization expense due to unfavorable retrospective unlocking in the first six months of 2007.  The foregoing items are discussed further below.

Our mortality and expense assessments are deducted from our contract holders’ account values and reported as insurance fees. For this business, the mortality and expense assessments amounts are a function of the rates priced into the product and face amount of our insurance in force. Insurance in force, in turn, is driven by sales, persistency and mortality experience.  Included in the business acquired with the Jefferson-Pilot companies are BOLI products, which accounted for $1.7 billion in contract holder fund balances as of June 30, 2008. VOBA balances, net of unearned revenue reserves, related to these blocks were approximately $113 million as of June 30, 2008. These contracts, which are generally not subject to surrender charges, are owned by several thousand contract holders. These contracts were primarily originated through, and continue to be serviced by, two marketing organizations. The surrender rate for this product may increase beyond current experience due to the absence of surrender charges and rising interest rates that may result in returns available to contract holders on competitors’ products being more attractive than on our policies in force. The following factors may influence contract holders to continue these coverages: our ability to adjust crediting rates; relatively high minimum rate guarantees; the difficulty of re-underwriting existing and additional covered lives; and unfavorable tax attributes of certain surrenders. Our assumptions for amortizing VOBA and unearned revenue for these policies reflect a higher long-term expected lapse rate than other blocks of business due to the factors noted above. Lapse experience for this block in a particular period could vary significantly from our long-term lapse assumptions.  Consistent with the way we report UL sales, we report COLI and BOLI sales as 100% of annualized expected target premium plus 5% of paid excess premium, including an adjustment for internal replacements at approximately 50% of target. Sales in this business tend to be of large case nature and can fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter.  Comparison of the Three Months Ended June 30, 2008 to 2007   Mortality and expense assessments for this business increased as client deposits were primarily in variable products partially offset by declines in variable account values from unfavorable equity markets.  Comparison of the Six Months Ended June 30, 2008 to 2007  Mortality and expense assessments for this business were favorably impacted by higher variable fees resulting from a customer transferring $55 million of fixed account value to variable account value in the second quarter of 2007 partially offset by declines in variable account values from unfavorable equity markets. This transfer had an offsetting impact on investment income and interest credited as discussed below. Expense assessments also increased as client deposits were primarily in variable products.  Insurance in force increased modestly as growth over the prior year due to sales was partially offset by term rider face reductions in the second quarter of 2008.    73    Net Investment Income and Interest Credited  Details underlying net investment income and interest credited (in millions) were as follows:                              For the ThreeMonths EndedJune 30,         For the SixMonths EndedJune 30,            2008   2007   Change     2008   2007   Change     Net Investment Income                           Fixed maturity securities, mortgage loans on real estate and other, net of investment expenses   $ 51   $ 51   0 %   $ 101   $ 104   -3 %   Commercial mortgage loan prepayment and bond makewhole premiums (1)     —      —    NM       1     1   0 %   Surplus investments (2)     1     2   -50 %     3     4   -25 %                                     Total net investment income   $ 52   $ 53   -2 %   $ 105   $ 109   -4 %                                     Interest Credited   $ 38   $ 37   3 %   $ 77   $ 76   1 %                                         (1)  See “Consolidated Investments – Commercial Mortgage Loan Prepayment and Bond Makewhole Premiums” below for additional information.     (2)  Represents net investment income on the required statutory surplus for this segment.  When analyzing the impact of net investment income for this segment, it is important to understand that a portion of the investment income earned is credited to the contract holders of our fixed products, including the fixed portion of variable. We expect to earn a spread between what we earn on the underlying general account investments supporting the fixed product line and what we credit to our fixed contract holders’ accounts.  Commercial mortgage loan prepayments and bond makewhole premiums, investment income on alternative investments and surplus investment income can vary significantly from period to period due to a number of factors and, therefore, can provide results that are not indicative of the underlying trends.  Comparison of the Three Months Ended June 30, 2008 to 2007  Earnings on surplus investments were negatively impacted by unfavorable equity markets.  On January 1, 2008, we implemented a 25 basis point increase in crediting rates on a small block of policies that have approximately $150 million of fixed account value. Despite this crediting rate action, interest credited remained relatively flat as fixed account values have only modestly increased as client deposits were primarily in variable products.  Comparison of the Six Months Ended June 30, 2008 to 2007  Fixed maturity securities, mortgage loans on real estate and other net investment income decreased due to the unfavorable impact of a customer transferring $55 million from fixed account value to variable account value in the second quarter of 2007, reducing the interest margin, and higher consent fees in 2007. Additionally, earnings on surplus investments were negatively impacted by unfavorable equity markets.  Interest credited remained relatively flat as modest fixed account value growth and the crediting rate action discussed above were partially offset by the impact of a customer transferring $55 million from fixed account value to variable account value in the second quarter of 2007.  Benefits  Benefits for this segment include claims incurred during the period in excess of the associated account balance for its interest-sensitive products.  Comparison of the Three Months Ended June 30, 2008 to 2007  Benefits increased modestly due to slightly less favorable mortality yet remained in line with growth in business in force.    74    Comparison of the Six Months Ended June 30, 2008 to 2007  Benefits increased modestly due to slightly less favorable mortality yet remained in line with growth in business in force. Additionally, benefits were favorably impacted by a recovery on a reinsurance agreement in the first quarter of 2007.  Underwriting, Acquisition, Insurance and Other Expenses  Details underlying underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses (in millions) were as follows:                                  For the ThreeMonths EndedJune 30,     Change     For the SixMonths EndedJune 30,     Change        2008     2007       2008     2007       Underwriting, Acquisition, Insurance and Other Expenses                               Commissions   $ 6     $ 7     -14 %   $ 18     $ 13     38 %   General and administrative expenses     3       2     50 %     6       5     20 %   Taxes, licenses and fees     1       1     0 %     3       2     50 %                                             Total expenses incurred     10       10     0 %     27       20     35 %   DAC and VOBA deferrals     (6 )     (7 )   14 %     (18 )     (14 )   -29 %                                             Total expenses recognized before amortization     4       3     33 %     9       6     50 %   DAC and VOBA amortization, net of interest:                               Retrospective unlocking     —        2     -100 %     (1 )     5     NM     Other amortization     2       4     -50 %     5       8     -38 %                                             Total underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses   $ 6     $ 9     -33 %   $ 13     $ 19     -32 %                                             DAC and VOBA deferrals                               As a percentage of sales     46.2 %     50.0 %         43.9 %     41.2 %      Commissions and other costs that vary with and are related primarily to the production of new business are deferred to the extent recoverable and, for our interest-sensitive products, are amortized over the lives of the contracts in relation to EGPs.  Comparison of the Three Months Ended June 30, 2008 to 2007  Expenses incurred remained flat as decreased sales and lower incentive compensation expense were offset by a change in expense allocation methodology within Employer Markets that did not affect consolidated expenses.  The unfavorable retrospective unlocking (increase to DAC and VOBA amortization) in the second quarter of 2007 was due to actual gross profits being lower than EGPs due to the impact of a customer transferring $55 million of fixed account value to variable account value, partially offset by favorable retrospective unlocking from market conditions.  Comparison of the Six Months Ended June 30, 2008 to 2007  The increase in expenses incurred was primarily a result of increased sales and the change in expense allocation discussed above.  The favorable retrospective unlocking (decrease to DAC and VOBA amortization) in the first six months of 2008 was due primarily to higher premiums received and lower death claims than estimated in our model projections. The unfavorable retrospective unlocking (increase to DAC and VOBA amortization) in the first six months 2007 was due to the impact of a customer transferring $55 million in fixed account value to variable account value discussed above and higher surrender activity than estimated in our model projections. The surrender activity occurred for a variety of reasons, and no systemic issues, such as service or product competitiveness, contributed to this surrender activity.    75    Employer Markets – Group Protection  The Group Protection segment offers group life, disability and dental insurance to employers. The segment’s products are marketed primarily through a national distribution system of regional group offices. These offices develop business through employee benefit brokers, third-party administrators and other employee benefit firms.

The increase in income from operations was partially offset by an increase to underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses due to growth in our business in force, elevated costs associated with investments in strategic initiatives and an increase in the allocation of expenses to this segment.    76    Comparison of the Six Months Ended June 30, 2008 to 2007  Income from operations for this segment increased due to the following:      •    Growth in insurance premiums driven by normal, organic business growth in our non-medical products and better than expected persistency; and      •    Combined total non-medical loss ratio experience at the lower end of our expected range.  The increase in income from operations was partially offset by an increase to underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses due to growth in our business in force, higher 401(k) expenses, elevated costs associated with investments in strategic initiatives and an increase in the allocation of expenses to this segment.  The foregoing items are discussed further below.  Insurance Premiums  Details underlying insurance premiums (in millions) were as follows:                              For the ThreeMonths EndedJune 30,   Change     For the SixMonths EndedJune 30,   Change        2008   2007     2008   2007     Insurance Premiums by Product Line                           Life   $ 134   $ 125   7 %   $ 267   $ 244   9 %   Disability     167     150   11 %     330     295   12 %   Dental     37     34   9 %     74     66   12 %                                     Total non-medical     338     309   9 %     671     605   11 %   Medical     55     52   6 %     92     88   5 %                                     Total insurance premiums   $ 393   $ 361   9 %   $ 763   $ 693   10 %                                     Sales   $ 65   $ 62   5 %   $ 119   $ 123   -3 %                                    Our cost of insurance and policy administration charges are embedded in the premiums charged to our customers. The premiums are a function of the rates priced into the product and our business in force. Business in force, in turn, is driven by sales and persistency experience.  Sales in the table above and as discussed below are the combined annualized premiums for our life, disability and dental products. Sales relate to long-duration contracts sold to new contract holders and new programs sold to existing contract holders. The trend in sales is an important indicator of development of business in force over time.  Comparison of the Three and Six Months Ended June 30, 2008 to 2007  The increase in insurance premiums in our non-medical business reflects normal business growth and favorable persistency experience.  Net Investment Income  We use our interest income to build the associated policy reserves, which is a function of our insurance premiums and the yields on our invested assets.  Comparison of the Three and Six Months Ended June 30, 2008 to 2007  Net investment income remained relatively flat as continued growth of business in force was offset by lower yields on required statutory surplus due to weaker results from our alternative investments.    77    Benefits  Details underlying benefits (in millions) were as follows:                                  For the ThreeMonths EndedJune 30,     Change     For the SixMonths EndedJune 30,     Change        2008     2007       2008     2007       Benefits by Product Line                               Life   $ 97     $ 92     5 %   $ 192     $ 181     6 %   Disability     111       100     11 %     221       200     11 %   Dental     30       27     11 %     60       53     13 %                                             Total non-medical     238       219     9 %     473       434     9 %   Medical     49       47     4 %     82       78     5 %                                             Total benefits   $ 287     $ 266     8 %   $ 555     $ 512     8 %                                             Loss Ratios by Product Line                               Life     72.3 %     73.9 %         72.1 %     74.5 %       Disability     66.1 %     66.4 %         67.1 %     67.9 %       Dental     81.1 %     79.3 %         81.0 %     79.2 %       Total non-medical     70.2 %     70.8 %         70.6 %     71.8 %       Medical     88.6 %     89.3 %         88.2 %     89.0 %      Note: Loss ratios presented above are calculated using whole dollars instead of dollars rounded to millions.  Management has chosen to focus on trends in loss ratios to compare actual experience with pricing expectations because group-underwriting risks change over time. We believe that loss ratios in the 71-74% range are more representative of longer-term expectations for the composite non-medical portion of this segment. We expect normal fluctuations in this range, as claim experience is inherently uncertain, and there can be no assurance that experience will fall inside this expected range.  Comparison of the Three and Six Months Ended June 30, 2008 to 2007  We experienced favorable claim experience on all of our non-medical and medical products, except for dental. Our improved total non-medical loss ratio was driven by exceptional life and disability results. Our life loss ratio benefited from favorable waiver claims experience. Our disability loss ratio benefited from favorable termination and incidence experience. The termination experience was only relevant for the six months ended June 30, 2008, as compared to the corresponding period in the prior year.    78    Underwriting, Acquisition, Insurance and Other Expenses  Details underlying underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses (in millions) were as follows:                                  For the ThreeMonths EndedJune 30,     Change     For the SixMonths EndedJune 30,     Change        2008     2007       2008     2007       Underwriting, Acquisition, Insurance and Other Expenses                               Commissions   $ 43     $ 41     5 %   $ 87     $ 81     7 %   General and administrative expenses     41       37     11 %     83       70     19 %   Taxes, licenses and fees     9       10     -10 %     19       19     0 %                                             Total expenses incurred     93       88     6 %     189       170     11 %   DAC and VOBA deferrals     (13 )     (14 )   7 %     (27 )     (25 )   -8 %                                             Total expenses recognized before amortization     80       74     8 %     162       145     12 %   DAC and VOBA amortization, net of interest     9       6     50 %     17       14     21 %                                             Total underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses   $ 89     $ 80     11 %   $ 179     $ 159     13 %                                             DAC and VOBA Deferrals                               As a percentage of insurance premiums     3.3 %     3.9 %         3.5 %     3.6 %      Expenses, excluding commissions, that vary with and are related primarily to the production of new business are deferred to the extent recoverable and are amortized on either a straight-line basis or as a level percent of premium of the related contracts depending on the block of business. Commissions, which vary with and are related to paid premiums, are expensed as incurred. The level of expenses is an important driver of profitability for this segment as group insurance contracts are offered within an environment that competes on the basis of price and service.  Comparison of the Three Months Ended June 30, 2008 to 2007  The increase in underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses was in line with the increase in insurance premiums and is attributable to growth in our business in force, elevated costs associated with investments in strategic initiatives and an increase in the allocation of expenses to this segment.  Comparison of the Six Months Ended June 30, 2008 to 2007  The increase in underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses was in line with the increase in insurance premiums and is attributable to higher 401(k) expenses, elevated costs associated with investments in strategic initiatives and an increase in the allocation of expenses to this segment. Partially offsetting the increase in expenses were higher deferrals, driven by strategic sales expenses.    79    RESULTS OF INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT  The Investment Management segment, through Delaware Investments, provides a broad range of managed account portfolios, mutual funds, sub-advised funds and other investment products to individual investors and to institutional investors such as private and public pension funds, foundations and endowment funds.

Comparison of the Three Months Ended June 30, 2008 to 2007  Income from operations increased due primarily to the following:      •    Expenses incurred in the second quarter of 2007 for the launch of a closed-end fund as well as additions to a reserve for legal matters in that quarter; and      •    Lower incentive compensation accruals as a result of lower earnings and production performance relative to planned goals.  The increase in income from operations was partially offset by:      •    Lower investment advisory fees due to lower assets under management driven by the sale of certain institutional fixed income business and less favorable equity markets; and      •    Negative returns on seed capital driven by the unfavorable equity markets in the second quarter of 2008.  Comparison of the Six Months Ended June 30, 2008 to 2007  Income from operations decreased slightly due primarily to the following:      •    Lower investment advisory fees due to lower assets under management driven by the sale of certain institutional fixed income business and less favorable equity markets; and      •    Negative returns on seed capital driven by the unfavorable equity markets in 2008.  The decrease in income from operations was partially offset by:      •    Expenses incurred in the first six months of 2007 for the launch of a closed-end fund as well as additions to a reserve for legal matters; and    80        •    Lower incentive compensation accruals as a result of lower earnings and production performance relative to planned goals.

Investment advisory fees – external includes amounts that are ultimately paid to sub-advisors for managing the sub-advised assets. The amounts paid to sub-advisors are generally included in the segment’s expenses.  Investment advisory fees – inter-segment consists of fees for asset management services this segment provides to Individual Markets and Employer Markets for managing general account assets supporting fixed income products and surplus and separate account assets. These inter-segment amounts are not reported on our Consolidated Statements of Income as they are eliminated along with the associated expenses incurred by Individual Markets and Employer Markets. Individual Markets and Employer Markets report the cost as a reduction to net investment income, which is the same methodology that would be used if these services were provided by an external party.  The level of net flows may vary considerably from period to period, and therefore results in one period are not indicative of net flows in subsequent periods.  Comparison of the Three Months Ended June 30, 2008 to 2007  Investment advisory fees – external decreased due primarily to lower third-party average assets under management as a result of less favorable equity market returns, an increase in negative net flows and lower advisory revenues as a result of the fixed income transaction, as discussed below. Market value changes on assets under management in the second quarter of 2008 were $(530) million in retail and $(816) million in institutional compared to $1.9 billion in retail and $984 million in institutional for the same period in 2007.  On October 31, 2007, we sold certain institutional taxable fixed income business to an unaffiliated investment management company. As a result of this transaction, assets under management decreased by $12.3 billion which resulted in an estimated $5 million decrease to investment advisory fees – external in the second quarter of 2008.  Comparison of the Six Months Ended June 30, 2008 to 2007  Investment advisory fees – external decreased due primarily to lower third-party average assets under management as a result of less favorable equity market returns, an increase in negative net flows and lower advisory revenues of $9 million as a result of the     82     2007 fixed income transaction, as discussed above. Market value changes on assets under management in the first six months of 2008 were $(3.6) billion in retail and $(2.9) billion in institutional compared to $2.7 billion in retail and $1.6 billion in institutional for the same period in 2007.  Investment advisory fees – inter-segment decreased due to a decline in total inter-segment assets under management, primarily related to the transition of the investment advisory role for the Lincoln Variable Insurance Trust product effective May 1, 2007, to Employer Markets. In the role of investment advisor, Investment Management provided investment performance and compliance oversight on third-party investment managers in exchange for a fee. Investment Management continues to manage certain of the assets as a sub-advisor. As a result of this change, Investment Management’s assets under management decreased by $3 billion, however, there was no impact to our consolidated assets under management or consolidated net income.  Other Revenues and Fees  Comparison of the Three and Six Months Ended June 30, 2008 to 2007  Other revenues and fees decreased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2008 and 2007, partly due to a $4 million and $9 million decrease, respectively, in the return on seed capital due to unfavorable equity markets. Seed capital investments are important to establishing a track record for products that will later be sold to investors. These investments are valued at market value each reporting period and the change in market value impacts other revenues. Other revenues and fees was also negatively impacted by the loss of fees from the movement of the investment accounting function to a third party and by lower 12b-1 revenue related to lower average assets under management.  Operating Expenses  Comparison of the Three and Six Months Ended June 30, 2008 to 2007  Operating expenses decreased due primarily to the elimination of certain expenses as a result of transferring the investment advisory role of Lincoln Variable Insurance Trust to another internal advisor, selling certain fixed income business to an unaffiliated investment management company and transitioning the investment accounting function to a third party. Also, accruals for variable compensation based on revenue have decreased. The prior year periods included a $6 million accrual for legal expenses. In addition, in the prior year periods, a new closed-end fund was launched. Costs associated with the launch of this fund were $5 million.    83    RESULTS OF LINCOLN UK  Lincoln UK is headquartered in Barnwood, Gloucester, England, and is licensed to do business throughout the United Kingdom. Lincoln UK focuses primarily on protecting and enhancing the value of its existing customer base. The segment accepts new deposits from existing relationships and markets a limited range of new products including retirement income solutions. Lincoln UK’s product portfolio principally consists of unit-linked life and pension products, which are similar to U.S. produced variable life and annuity products, where the risk associated with the underlying investments is borne by the contract holders. The segment is sensitive to changes in the foreign currency exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the British pound sterling. A significant increase in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the British pound would have a significant adverse effect on the segment’s operating results.  Income from Operations  Details underlying the results for Lincoln UK (in millions) were as follows:                              For the ThreeMonths EndedJune 30,   Change     For the SixMonths EndedJune 30,   Change        2008   2007     2008   2007     Operating Revenues                           Insurance premiums   $ 26   $ 24   8 %   $ 45   $ 48   -6 %   Insurance fees     52     50   4 %     98     96   2 %   Net investment income     20     19   5 %     40     39   3 %                                     Total operating revenues     98     93   5 %     183     183   0 %                                     Operating Expenses                           Benefits     30     34   -12 %     61     70   -13 %   Underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses     40     41   -2 %     78     78   0 %                                     Total operating expenses     70     75   -7 %     139     148   -6 %                                     Income from operations before taxes     28     18   56 %     44     35   26 %   Federal income taxes     10     6   67 %     15     12   25 %                                     Income from operations   $ 18   $ 12   50 %   $ 29   $ 23   26 %                                              For the ThreeMonths EndedJune 30,   Change     For the SixMonths EndedJune 30,   Change        2008   2007     2008   2007     Exchange Rate Ratio-U.S. Dollars to Pounds Sterling                           Average for the period     1.986     1.989   0 %     1.987     1.977   1 %   End-of-period     1.992     2.008   -1 %     1.992     2.008   -1 %  As presented in the tables above, the change in the average exchange rate was immaterial when comparing the three and six months ended June 30, 2008, to the corresponding periods in 2007.  Comparison of the Three Months Ended June 30, 2008 to 2007   Income from operations for this segment increased due primarily to modest revenue increases and net favorable benefit reserve adjustments, which are discussed further below.  Comparison of the Six Months Ended June 30, 2008 to 2007  Income from operations for this segment increased due primarily to net favorable benefit reserve adjustments and a reduction in benefits related to lower levels of vested annuity premiums, which are discussed further below.  The foregoing items are discussed further below.    84    Insurance Premiums  Insurance premiums are primarily a function of the rates priced into the product and face amount of our insurance in force.  Comparison of the Three Months Ended June 30, 2008 to 2007  Insurance premiums increased due primarily to a $2 million increase in the annuitization of vesting pension policies. The increase in the amount of premiums received resulted in a corresponding increase in benefits.  Comparison of the Six Months Ended June 30, 2008 to 2007  Insurance premiums decreased due primarily to a $2 million decrease in the annuitization of vesting pension policies. The decrease in the amount of premiums received resulted in a corresponding decrease in benefits.  Our annualized policy lapse rate as of the second quarter of 2008 was 6.3% as compared to 6.7% for the corresponding period in 2007, as measured by the number of policies in force.  Insurance Fees  Details underlying insurance fees, business in force and unit-linked assets (in millions) were as follows:                                  For the ThreeMonths EndedJune 30,     Change     For the SixMonths EndedJune 30,     Change        2008     2007       2008     2007       Insurance Fees                               Mortality assessments   $ 9     $ 9     0 %   $ 18     $ 19     -5 %   Expense assessments     37       35     6 %     67       65     3 %   DFEL:                               Deferrals     (1 )     (1 )   0 %     (2 )     (2 )   0 %   Amortization, excluding unlocking     8       7     14 %     15       15     0 %   Retrospective unlocking     (1 )     —      NM       —        (1 )   100 %                                             Total insurance fees   $ 52     $ 50     4 %   $ 98     $ 96     2 %                                                      For the ThreeMonths EndedJune 30,     Change     For the SixMonths EndedJune 30,     Change        2008     2007       2008     2007       Unit-Linked Assets                               Balance at beginning-of-period   $ 8,079     $ 8,906     -9 %   $ 8,850     $ 8,757     1 %   Deposits     101       100     1 %     161       168     -4 %   Withdrawals and deaths     (227 )     (251 )   10 %     (439 )     (491 )   11 %                                             Net flows     (126 )     (151 )   17 %     (278 )     (323 )   14 %   Investment income and change in market value     (150 )     229     NM       (758 )     506     NM     Foreign currency adjustment     30       184     -84 %     19       228     -92 %                                             Balance at end-of-period   $ 7,833     $ 9,168     -15 %   $ 7,833     $ 9,168     -15 %                                            The insurance fees reflect mortality and expense assessments on unit-linked account values to cover insurance and administrative charges. These assessments are primarily a function of the rates priced into the product, the face amount of insurance in force and the average unit-linked assets, which is driven by net flows on the account values and the financial markets. Although the use of the reversion to the mean process has lessened the impact of short-term volatility in equity markets, the segment’s fee income remains subject to volatility in the equity markets as it affects the level of the underlying assets that drive the fee income.    85    Comparison of the Three and Six Months Ended June 30, 2008 to 2007  Excluding the effect of unlocking, insurance fees increased due primarily to higher dividend income and equity gains, partially offset by decreasing bond values resulting in a $2 million higher linked tax deduction from the unit-linked account. Additionally, expense assessments increased $1 million due to higher U.K. Department of Work and Pensions premiums.  Net Investment Income  We use our interest income to build the associated policy reserves, which is a function of our insurance premiums and the yields on our invested assets.  Comparison of the Three Months Ended June 30, 2008 to 2007  Net investment income increased due primarily to increased investments in short term bonds.  Comparison of the Six Months Ended June 30, 2008 to 2007  Net investment income increased due primarily to higher yields and increased investments in short term bonds.  Benefits  Benefits for this segment include claims incurred during the period in excess of the associated account balance for its unit-linked products. Benefits are recognized when incurred.  Comparison of the Three Months Ended June 30, 2008 to 2007  Benefits decreased due primarily to a reduction of $6 million in the mis-selling reserve following a favorable conclusion by the U.K. Financial Ombudsman Service (“FOS”) regarding Lincoln UK’s time barring of claims, a one-time reduction in the death claim reserve of $3 million and better permanent health income experience of $2 million. These decreases were partially offset by an unfavorable tax reserve adjustment of $5 million as well as a $2 million increase in reserves due to higher levels of vested annuity premiums.  Comparison of the Six Months Ended June 30, 2008 to 2007   Benefits decreased due primarily to a reduction of $6 million in the mis-selling reserve following a favorable finding by the U.K. FOS regarding Lincoln UK’s time barring of claims, a one-time reduction in the death claim reserve of $3 million following a reconciliation of previously paid claims, better permanent health income experience of $2 million and a decrease in reserves of $2 million due to lower levels of vested annuity premiums. These decreases were partially offset by an unfavorable tax reserve adjustment of $5 million.    86    Underwriting, Acquisition, Insurance and Other Expenses  Details underlying underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses (in millions) were as follows:                                  For the ThreeMonths EndedJune 30,     Change     For the SixMonths EndedJune 30,     Change        2008     2007       2008     2007       Underwriting, Acquisition, Insurance and Other Expenses                               Commissions   $ 1     $ 1     0 %   $ 2     $ 2     0 %   General and administrative expenses     26       27     -4 %     52       53     -2 %                                             Total expenses incurred     27       28     -4 %     54       55     -2 %   DAC and VOBA deferrals     (1 )     (1 )   0 %     (1 )     (1 )   0 %                                             Total expenses recognized before amortization     26       27     -4 %     53       54     -2 %   DAC and VOBA amortization, net of interest:                               Retrospective unlocking     1       —      NM       —        (1 )   100 %   Other amortization, net of interest     13       14     -7 %     25       25     0 %                                             Total underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses   $ 40     $ 41     -2 %   $ 78     $ 78     0 %                                            Commissions and other costs, which vary with and are related primarily to the production of new business, are deferred to the extent recoverable. DAC and VOBA related to unit-linked business are amortized over the lives of the contracts in relation to EGPs. For our traditional products, DAC and VOBA are amortized on either a straight-line basis or as a level percent of premium of the related contracts depending on the block of business.    87    RESULTS OF OTHER OPERATIONS  Other Operations includes investments related to the excess capital in our insurance subsidiaries, investments in media properties and other corporate investments, benefit plan net assets, the unamortized deferred gain on indemnity reinsurance, which was sold to Swiss Re in 2001, corporate debt and corporate reinsurance. We are actively managing our remaining radio station clusters to maximize performance and future value. Other Operations also includes the Institutional Pension business, which was previously reported in Employer Markets – Retirement Products. The Institutional Pension business is a closed-block of pension business, the majority of which was sold on a group annuity basis, and is currently in run-off.

The increase in loss from operations was partially offset by the following:      •    Lower interest and debt expenses as a result of a decline in interest rates that affect our variable rate borrowings partially offset by higher average balances of outstanding debt in the current period; and      •    Unfavorable mortality in our Institutional Pension business in the second quarter of 2007.    88    Comparison of the Six Months Ended June 30, 2008 to 2007  Loss from operations for this segment increased due primarily to the following:      •    Lower media earnings related primarily due to lower advertising revenues caused by market conditions;      •    Higher other expenses primarily attributable to the impact of the one-time curtailment gain recorded in the second quarter of 2007 related to our employee pension plan and the relocation costs associated with the move of our corporate office;      •    Higher interest and debt expenses from increased debt; and      •    Less favorable tax items that impacted the effective tax rate.  The increase in loss from operations was partially offset by the following:      •    Higher net investment income from an increase in invested assets driven by distributable earnings received from our insurance segments, dividends received from our other segments and issuances of debt as these items exceeded share repurchases and dividends paid to stockholders; and      •    Unfavorable mortality in our Institutional Pension business in the second quarter of 2007.  Certain of the foregoing items are discussed further below.  Net Investment Income and Interest Credited  We utilize an internal formula to determine the amount of capital that is allocated to our business segments. Investment income on capital in excess of the calculated amounts is reported in Other Operations. If regulations require increases in our insurance segments’ statutory reserves and surplus, the amount of capital allocated to Other Operations would decrease and net investment income would be negatively impacted. In addition, as discussed below in “Review of Consolidated Financial Condition – Alternative Sources of Liquidity,” the holding company maintains an inter-segment cash management account where other segments can borrow from or lend money to the holding company. The inter-segment cash management account affects net investment income for Other Operations, as all inter-segment eliminations are reported within Other Operations.  Write-downs for other-than-temporary impairments decrease the recorded value of our invested assets owned by our business segments. These write-downs are not included in the income from operations of our operating segments. When impairment occurs, assets are transferred to the business segments’ portfolios and will reduce the future net investment income for Other Operations, but should not have an impact on a consolidated basis unless the impairments are related to defaulted securities. Statutory reserve adjustments for our business segments can also cause allocations of invested assets between the affected segments and Other Operations.  The majority of our interest credited relates to our reinsurance operations sold to Swiss Re in 2001. A substantial amount of the business was sold through indemnity reinsurance transactions resulting in some of the business still flowing through our consolidated financial statements. The interest credited corresponds to investment income earnings on the assets we continue to hold for this business. There is no impact to income or loss in Other Operations or on a consolidated basis for these amounts.  Comparison of the Three Months Ended June 30, 2008 to 2007  The decrease in net investment income was attributable to a decrease in yields, partially offset by an increase in invested assets that was driven by distributable earnings received from our insurance segments, dividends received from our other segments and issuances of debt. The increase in invested assets from these items exceeded the amount utilized by share repurchases, dividends paid to stockholders and transfers to other segments for other-than-temporary impairments. Also, decreases in our inter-segment cash management account and collateral under securities loaned favorably impacted net investment income.  Comparison of the Six Months Ended June 30, 2008 to 2007  The increase in net investment income was attributable to an increase in invested assets driven by distributable earnings received from our insurance segments, dividends received from our other segments and issuances of debt. These items exceeded the amount of share repurchases, dividends paid to stockholders and transfers to other segments for other-than-temporary impairments. This increase in invested assets was partially offset by lower yields as a result of lower interest rates in the current period.    89    Benefits  Benefits are recognized when incurred for Institutional Pension products.  Comparison of the Three and Six Months Ended June 30, 2008 to 2007  The decrease in benefits was a result of unfavorable mortality in our Institutional Pension business in the second quarter of 2007.  Other Expenses  Details underlying other expenses (in millions) were as follows:                                For the ThreeMonths EndedJune 30,           For the SixMonths EndedJune 30,              2008   2007     Change     2008   2007     Change     Other Expenses                             Merger-related expenses   $ 16   $ 30     -47 %   $ 31   $ 44     -30 %   Branding     11     9     22 %     18     16     13 %   Retirement Income Security Ventures     2     3     -33 %     4     4     0 %   Taxes, licenses and fees     1     1     0 %     3     4     -25 %   Other     18     (4 )   NM       29     (4 )   NM                                           Total other expenses   $ 48   $ 39     23 %   $ 85   $ 64     33 %                                        Other expenses for Other Operations includes expenses that are corporate in nature such as merger-related expenses, restructuring costs, branding, charitable contributions, certain litigation reserves, amortization of FCC license intangibles on our radio clusters, other expenses not allocated to our business segments and inter-segment expense eliminations, excluding those associated with our inter-segment investment advisory fees.  Comparison of the Three Months Ended June 30, 2008 to 2007  The increase in other expenses was attributable primarily to the effect of the one-time curtailment gain recorded in the second quarter of 2007 related to our employee pension plan after we announced on May 1, 2007, our plan to freeze our defined benefit pension benefits and replace them with an enhanced match in our 401(k) defined contribution plan beginning January 1, 2008, and an increase in incentive compensation expense, strategic initiative costs and facilities expense. These increases in other expenses were partially offset by a decrease in merger-related expenses as a result of higher system integration work related to our administrative systems in 2007.  Comparison of the Six Months Ended June 30, 2008 to 2007  The increase in other expenses was attributable primarily to the impact of the one-time curtailment gain recorded in the second quarter of 2007 and relocation costs associated with the move of our corporate office and an increase in incentive compensation expense, strategic costs and facilities expense. These increases in other expenses were partially offset by a decrease in merger-related expenses as a result of higher system integration work related to our administrative systems in 2007.  Merger-related expenses were the result of actions undertaken by us to eliminate duplicate operations and functions as a result of the Jefferson-Pilot merger along with costs related to the implementation of our new unified product portfolio and other initiatives. These actions will be ongoing and are expected to be substantially complete by the first half of 2009. Our current estimate of the cumulative integration expenses is approximately $215 million to $225 million, pre-tax, and excludes amounts capitalized or recorded to goodwill.  Interest and Debt Expense  The timing and/or discretionary nature of uses of cash for the repurchase of stock, incentive compensation and the availability of funds from our cash management account may result in changes in external financing and volatility in interest expense. For additional information on our financing activities, see “Review of Consolidated Financial Condition – Liquidity and Capital Resources – Sources of Liquidity and Cash Flow – Financing Activities” below.    90    Comparison of the Three Months Ended June 30, 2008 to 2007  The decrease in interest and debt expense was due primarily to the decrease in interest rates on our variable rate borrowings partially offset by an increased average outstanding debt balance in the second quarter of 2008 as compared to the second quarter of 2007. The increased debt was primarily the result of $375 million issued in the fourth quarter of 2007 to fund a captive reinsurance company (calculated under AG38), which was created for the purpose of reinsuring liabilities of our existing insurance affiliates, primarily related to statutory reserves on UL products with secondary guarantees.  Comparison of the Six Months Ended June 30, 2008 to 2007  The increase in interest and debt expense was due primarily to an increase in our debt, which was primarily the result of $375 million issued in the fourth quarter of 2007 to fund a captive reinsurance company. This increase was partially offset by lower interest rates on our variable borrowings in the first six months of 2008 compared to the first six months of 2007.  Federal Income Tax Benefit  Comparison of the Three and Six Months Ended June 30, 2008 to 2007  The decrease in the federal income tax benefit was due to less favorable tax items that impacted the effective tax rate related primarily to changes in tax preferred investments.    91    REALIZED GAIN (LOSS)  Details underlying realized gain (loss), after-DAC (1)  (in millions) were as follows:                                  For the ThreeMonths EndedJune 30,           For the SixMonths EndedJune 30,              2008     2007     Change     2008     2007     Change     Pre-Tax                               Operating realized gain:                               Indexed annuity net derivatives results   $ —      $ 2     -100 %   $ (2 )   $ 2     NM     GLB     10       1     NM       16       2     NM     GDB hedge cost     2       (2 )   200 %     9       (2 )   NM                                               Total operating realized gain     12       1     NM       23       2     NM                                               Realized gain (loss) related to certain investments     (125 )     (9 )   NM       (166 )     18     NM     Gain (loss) on certain reinsurance derivative/trading securities     1       4     -75 %     2       4     -50 %   GLB derivatives results:                               Attributed fees for net valuation premium (2)     23       12     92 %     42       23     83 %   Change in reserves hedged (2)     213       48     NM       (161 )     74     NM     Change in market value of derivative assets (2)     (248 )     (51 )   NM       63       (74 )   185 %                                             Hedge program effectiveness (2) (3)     (12 )     9     NM       (56 )     23     NM     Change in reserves not hedged (2)     17       —      NM       109       —      NM     Loss from the initial impact of adopting SFAS 157 (2)     —        —      NM       (33 )     —      NM     Associated amortization expense of DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL     (2 )     (4 )   50 %     (25 )     (10 )   NM                                               GLB net derivatives results     3       5     -40 %     (5 )     13     NM     Indexed annuity forward-starting option     2       5     -60 %     7       3     133 %   GDB derivatives results     (3 )     1     NM       (8 )     1     NM     Gain on sale of subsidiaries/businesses     2       —      NM       4       —      NM                                               Excluded realized gain (loss)     (120 )     6           (166 )     39     NM                                               Total realized gain (loss)   $ (108 )   $ 7     NM     $ (143 )   $ 41     NM                                                        For the ThreeMonths EndedJune 30,           For the SixMonths EndedJune 30,              2008     2007     Change     2008     2007     Change     After-Tax                               Operating realized gain:                               Indexed annuity net derivatives results   $ —      $ 1     -100 %   $ (1 )   $ 1     NM     GLB     7       1     NM       10       1     NM     GDB hedge cost     1       (1 )   200 %     6       (1 )   NM                                               Total operating realized gain     8       1     NM       15       1     NM                                               Realized gain (loss) related to certain investments     (80 )     (5 )   NM       (108 )     12     NM     Gain (loss) on certain reinsurance derivative/trading securities     1       3     -67 %     1       2     -50 %   GLB net derivatives results (4)     1       3     -67 %     (3 )     9     NM     GDB derivative results     (2 )     —      NM       (5 )     —      NM     Indexed annuity forward-starting option     1       3     -67 %     4       2     100 %   Gain on sale of subsidiaries/businesses     1       —      NM       3       —      NM                                               Excluded realized gain (loss)     (78 )     4           (108 )     25     NM                                               Total realized gain (loss)   $ (70 )   $ 5     NM     $ (93 )   $ 26     NM                                                92         (1)  DAC refers to the associated amortization of expense of DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL and changes in other contract holder funds.

(3)  Our hedge performance after-DAC and after-tax, excluding DAC unlocking and changes in the non-performance risk factor, was an estimated $(4) million and $(15) million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2008, respectively.     (4)  The components of the GLB net derivatives results are presented in the pre-tax section above.  Operating Realized Gain  Operating realized gain includes the following:       •    Indexed annuity net derivative results – Represents the net difference between the change in the fair value of the S&P 500 Index® call options that we hold and the change in the fair value of the embedded derivative liabilities of our indexed annuities products. The change in the fair value of the liability for the embedded derivative represents the amount that is credited to the indexed annuity contract.      •    GLB – Represents the portion of the GLB rider fees calculated as the attributed fees in excess of the net valuation premium. Net valuation premium represents a level portion of rider fees required to fund potential claims for living benefits. The attributed fees are the fees used in the calculation of the embedded derivative and represent net valuation premium plus a margin that a theoretical market participant would include for risk/profit, as well as the non-performance risk factor required by SFAS 157 benefit costs.      •    GDB hedge cost – Represents the change in the fair value of the derivatives that offsets the benefit ratio unlocking of our SOP 03-1 reserves on our GDB riders, including our expected cost of the hedging instruments  Comparison of the Three and Six Months Ended June 30, 2008 to 2007  Our operating realized gain increased due primarily to the market participant risk/profit margins partially offset by the non-performance risk factor required by SFAS 157.  Realized Gain (Loss) Related to Certain Investments  See “Consolidated Investments – Realized Gain (Loss) Related to Investments” below.  Gain (Loss) on Certain Reinsurance Derivative/Trading Securities  Gain (loss) on certain reinsurance derivative/trading securities represents changes in the fair values of total return swaps (embedded derivatives) theoretically included in our various modified coinsurance and coinsurance with funds withheld reinsurance arrangements that have contractual returns related to various assets and liabilities associated with these arrangements. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are offset by the change in fair value of trading securities in the portfolios that support these arrangements.  GLB Net Derivatives Results and GDB Derivatives Results  Our GLB net derivatives results represents the net valuation premium, the change in the fair value of the embedded derivative liabilities of our GLB products and the change in the fair value of the derivative instruments we own to hedge. This includes the cost of purchasing the hedging instruments.  Our GDB derivatives results represents the net difference between the benefit ratio unlocking of SOP 03-1 reserves on our GDB riders and the change in the fair value of the derivatives excluding our expected cost of the hedging instruments.  We have a hedge program that is designed to mitigate the risk and earnings volatility caused by changes in equity markets, interest rates and volatility associated with the guaranteed benefit features of our variable annuity products, including GDB and GLB riders. The GLB guarantees in our variable annuity products are considered embedded derivatives and are recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value under SFAS 133 and SFAS 157. We use derivative instruments to hedge our exposure to the risks and earnings volatility that result from the embedded derivatives for GLBs. The change in fair value of these instruments tends to move in the opposite direction of the change in fair value of the embedded derivatives. In the table above, we have presented the components of our GLB results, which can be volatile especially when sudden and significant changes in equity markets and/or interest rates occur. For additional information on our guaranteed benefits, see “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Derivatives – Guaranteed Living Benefits” above.    93    Comparison of the Three and Six Months Ended June 30, 2008 to 2007  The less favorable GLB net derivatives results and GDB derivatives results were driven primarily by volatile capital markets conditions that affected both interest rates and equity market returns. The increased GLB losses were partially offset by the gains attributable to the SFAS 157 non-performance adjustments attributable primarily to the widening credit spreads.  Indexed Annuity Forward-Starting Option  Changes in the fair value of embedded derivative liabilities related to index call options we may purchase in the future to hedge contract holder index allocations applicable to future reset periods for our indexed annuity products as required under SFAS 133 and SFAS 157. These fair values represent an estimate of the cost of the options we will purchase in the future, discounted back to the date of the balance sheet, using current market indications of volatility and interest rates, which can vary significantly from period to period due to a number of factors and therefore can provide results that are not indicative of the underlying trends.  The six months ended June 30, 2008, includes a pre-tax $10 million ($6 million, after-tax) gain from the initial impact of adopting SFAS 157.

We follow a balanced approach to investing for both current income and prudent risk management, with an emphasis on generating sufficient current income, net of income tax, to meet our obligations to customers, as well as other general liabilities. This balanced approach requires the evaluation of expected return and risk of each asset class utilized, while still meeting our income objectives. This approach is important to our asset-liability management, since decisions can be made based upon both the economic and current investment income considerations affecting assets and liabilities. For a discussion on our risk management process, see “Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.”  Investment Portfolio Composition and Diversification  Fundamental to our investment policy is diversification across asset classes. Our investment portfolio, excluding cash and invested cash, is composed of fixed maturity securities, mortgage loans on real estate, real estate (either wholly-owned or in joint ventures) and other long-term investments. We purchase investments for our segmented portfolios that have yield, duration and other characteristics that take into account the liabilities of the products being supported.  We have the ability to maintain our investment holdings throughout credit cycles because of our capital position, the long-term nature of our liabilities and the matching of our portfolios of investment assets with the liabilities of our various products.  Fixed Maturity and Equity Securities Portfolios  Fixed maturity securities and equity securities consist of portfolios classified as available-for-sale and trading. Mortgage-backed and private securities are included in both available-for-sale and trading portfolios.  Details underlying our fixed maturity and equity securities portfolios by industry classification (in millions) are presented in the below tables. These tables agree in total with the presentation of available-for-sale securities in Note 4; however, the categories below represent a more detailed breakout of the available-for-sale portfolio; therefore, the investment classifications listed below do not agree to the investment categories provided in Note 4.    95                           As of June 30, 2008        AmortizedCost

trading securities support our modified coinsurance arrangements (“Modco”) and the investment results are passed directly to the reinsurers. Refer below to “Trading Securities” section for further details.  Available-for-Sale Securities  Because the general intent of the available-for-sale accounting guidance is to reflect stockholders’ equity as if unrealized gains and     97     losses were actually recognized, it is necessary that we consider all related accounting adjustments that would occur upon such a hypothetical recognition of unrealized gains and losses. Such related balance sheet effects include adjustments to the balances of DAC, VOBA, DFEL, other contract holder funds and deferred income taxes. Adjustments to each of these balances are charged or credited to accumulated other comprehensive income. For instance, DAC is adjusted upon the recognition of unrealized gains or losses since the amortization of DAC is based upon an assumed emergence of gross profits on certain insurance business. Deferred income tax balances are also adjusted, since unrealized gains or losses do not affect actual taxes currently paid.  As of June 30, 2008, and December 31, 2007, 91.8% and 90.7%, respectively, of total publicly traded and private securities in unrealized loss status were rated as investment grade. See Note 4 for ratings and maturity date information for our fixed maturity investment portfolio.  As more fully described in Note 1 of our 2007 Form 10-K, we regularly review our investment holdings for other-than-temporary impairments. Based on this review, the cause of the $1.9 billion increase in our gross available-for-sale securities unrealized losses for the six months ended June 30, 2008, was attributable primarily to a combination of reduced liquidity in several market segments, deterioration in credit fundamentals and an increase in treasury rates. We believe that the securities in an unrealized loss position as of June 30, 2008 were not other-than-temporarily impaired due to our ability and intent to hold for a period of time sufficient for recovery. For further information on our available-for-sales securities unrealized losses, see “Additional Details on our Unrealized Losses on Available-for-Sale Securities” below.  The quality of our available-for-sale fixed maturity securities portfolio, as measured at estimated fair value and by the percentage of fixed maturity securities invested in various ratings categories, relative to the entire fixed maturity available-for-sale security portfolio (in millions) was as follows:                                 NAIC Designation    Rating Agency Equivalent Designation   As of June 30, 2008     As of December 31, 2007        AmortizedCost     FairValue     % ofTotal     AmortizedCost     FairValue     % ofTotal     Investment Grade Securities                              1   Aaa / Aa / A   $ 34,410     $ 33,210     60.9 %   $ 34,648     $ 34,741     61.8 %  2   Baa     18,594       18,101     33.2 %     18,168       18,339     32.6 %                                                           53,004       51,311     94.1 %     52,816       53,080     94.4 %   Below Investment Grade Securities                              3   Ba     2,426       2,266     4.2 %     2,184       2,159     3.8 %  4   B     797       678     1.2 %     787       783     1.4 %  5   Caa and lower     313       246     0.5 %     270       238     0.4 %  6   In or near default     13       17     0.0 %     12       16     0.0 %                                                           3,549       3,207     5.9 %     3,253       3,196     5.6 %                                                    Total securities   $ 56,553     $ 54,518     100.0 %   $ 56,069     $ 56,276     100.0 %                                                    Securities below investment grade as a % of total fixed maturity available-for-sale securities     6.3 %     5.9 %         5.8 %     5.7 %      Comparisons between the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”) ratings and rating agency designations are published by the NAIC. The NAIC assigns securities quality ratings and uniform valuations, which are used by insurers when preparing their annual statements. The NAIC ratings are similar to the rating agency designations of the Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations for marketable bonds. NAIC ratings 1 and 2 include bonds generally considered investment grade (rated Baa3 or higher by Moody’s, or rated BBB- or higher by S&P and Fitch), by such ratings organizations. NAIC ratings 3 through 6 include bonds generally considered below investment grade (rated Ba1 or lower by Moody’s, or rated BB+ or lower by S&P and Fitch).  The estimated fair value for all private securities was $7.7 billion as of June 30, 2008, compared to $7.8 billion as of December 31, 2007, representing approximately 11% of total invested assets as of June 30, 2008, and December 31, 2007.  Trading Securities  Trading securities, which support certain reinsurance funds withheld and our Modco reinsurance agreements, are carried at estimated fair value and changes in estimated fair value are recorded in net income as they occur. Investment results for these     98     portfolios, including gains and losses from sales, are passed directly to the reinsurers through the contractual terms of the reinsurance arrangements. Offsetting these amounts are corresponding changes in the fair value of the embedded derivative liability associated with the underlying reinsurance arrangement. See Note 1 in our 2007 Form 10-K for more information regarding our accounting for Modco.  Mortgage-Backed Securities (Included in Available-for-Sale and Trading Securities)  Our fixed maturity securities include mortgage-backed securities. These securities are subject to risks associated with variable prepayments. This may result in differences between the actual cash flow and maturity of these securities than that expected at the time of purchase. Securities that have an amortized cost greater than par and are backed by mortgages that prepay faster than expected will incur a reduction in yield or a loss. Those securities with an amortized cost lower than par that prepay faster than expected will generate an increase in yield or a gain. In addition, we may incur reinvestment risks if market yields are lower than the book yields earned on the securities. Prepayments occurring slower than expected have the opposite impact. We may incur reinvestment risks if market yields are higher than the book yields earned on the securities and we are forced to sell the securities. The degree to which a security is susceptible to either gains or losses is influenced by: the difference between its amortized cost and par; the relative sensitivity of the underlying mortgages backing the assets to prepayment in a changing interest rate environment; and the repayment priority of the securities in the overall securitization structure.  We limit the extent of our risk on mortgage-backed securities by prudently limiting exposure to the asset class, by generally avoiding the purchase of securities with a cost that significantly exceeds par, by purchasing securities backed by stable collateral and by concentrating on securities with enhanced priority in their trust structure. Such securities with reduced risk typically have a lower yield (but higher liquidity) than higher-risk mortgage-backed securities. At selected times, higher-risk securities may be purchased if they do not compromise the safety of the general portfolio. As of June 30, 2008, we did not have a significant amount of higher-risk mortgage-backed securities. A significant amount of assets in our mortgage-backed securities portfolio are either guaranteed by U.S. government-sponsored enterprises or are supported in the securitization structure by junior securities enabling the assets to achieve high investment grade status.  Our exposure to subprime mortgage lending is limited to investments in banks and other financial institutions that may be impacted by subprime lending and direct investments in asset-backed securities collateralized debt obligations, asset-backed securities (“ABS”) and residential mortgage-backed securities (“RMBS”). Mortgage-related ABS are backed by home equity loans and RMBS are backed by residential mortgages. These securities are backed by loans that are characterized by borrowers of differing levels of creditworthiness: prime, Alt-A and subprime. Prime lending is the origination of residential mortgage loans to customers with excellent credit profiles. Alt-A lending is the origination of residential mortgage loans to customers who have Prime credit profiles but lack documentation to substantiate income. Subprime lending is the origination of loans to customers with weak or impaired credit profiles.  The slowing U.S. housing market, increased interest rates and relaxed underwriting standards for some originators of residential mortgage loans and home equity loans have recently led to higher delinquency rates, especially for loans originated in the past few years. We expect delinquency rates and loss rates on residential mortgages and home equity loans to increase in the future; however, we continue to expect to receive payments in accordance with contractual terms for a significant amount of our securities, largely due to the seniority of the claims on the collateral of the securities that we own. The tranches of the securities will experience losses according to their seniority level with the least senior (or most junior), typically the unrated residual tranche, taking the initial loss. The credit ratings of our securities reflect the seniority of the securities that we own. Our RMBS had a market value of $9.2 billion and an unrealized loss of $636 million, or 7%, as of June 30, 2008. The unrealized loss was due primarily to deteriorating market fundamentals and a general level of illiquidity in the market and resulting in price declines in many structured products.    99    The market value of investments backed by subprime loans was $602 million and represented 1% of our total investment portfolio as of June 30, 2008. Investments rated A or above represented 91% of the subprime investments and $293 million in market value of our subprime investments was backed by loans originating in 2005 and forward. Available-for-sale securities represent most of the subprime exposure with trading securities being only $16 million, or 3%, as of June 30, 2008.

Monoline insurers guarantee the timely repayment of bond principal and interest when a bond issuer defaults and generally provide credit enhancement for bond issues such as municipal bonds and private placements as well as other types and structures of securities. Our direct exposure represents our bond holdings of the actual Monoline insurers. Our insured bonds represent our holdings in bonds of other issuers that are insured by Monoline insurers.

See “Credit-Linked Notes” in Note 4.

(3)  Does not include the fair value of trading securities totaling $33 million, which support our Modco reinsurance agreements because investment results for these agreements are passed directly to the reinsurers. The $33 million in trading securities consisted of $9 million of direct exposure and $24 million of insured exposure. This table also excludes insured exposure totaling $16 million for a guaranteed investment tax credit partnership.  Credit-Linked Notes  As of June 30, 2008, and December 31, 2007, other contract holder funds on our Consolidated Balance Sheets included $850 million and $1.2 billion outstanding in funding agreements of the Lincoln National Life Insurance Company (“LNL”), respectively. LNL invested the proceeds of $850 million received for issuing three funding agreements in 2006 and 2007 into three separate credit-linked notes originated by third party companies. These credit-linked notes are classified as asset-backed securities and are included in our fixed maturity securities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. An additional $300 million funding agreement was assumed as a result of the merger of Jefferson-Pilot, but was not invested into credit-linked notes. This $300 million funding agreement matured on June 2, 2008.  We earn a spread between the coupon received on the credit-linked note and the interest credited on the funding agreement. Our credit-linked notes were created using a trust that combines highly rated assets with credit default swaps to produce a multi-class structured security. Our affiliate, Delaware Investments, actively manages the credit default swaps in the underlying portfolios. The high quality asset in two of these transactions is a AAA-rated ABS secured by a pool of credit card receivables. The high quality asset in the third transaction is a guaranteed investment contract issued by MBIA, which is further secured by a pool of high quality assets.  Consistent with other debt market instruments, we are exposed to credit losses within the structure of the credit-linked notes, which could result in principal losses to our investments. However, we have attempted to protect our investments from credit losses through the multi-tiered class structure of the credit-linked note, which requires the subordinated classes of the investment pool to absorb all of the initial credit losses. LNL owns the mezzanine tranche of these investments, which currently carries a mid-     103     or low-AA rating. Generally, based upon our models, the transactions can sustain anywhere from 6-11 defaults, depending on the transaction, in the underlying collateral pools with no loss to LNL. However, if that number of defaults is realized, any additional defaults will significantly impact our recovery. Once the subordination is completely exhausted, losses will be incurred on LNL’s investment. In general, the entire investment can be lost with 3-5 additional defaults. To date, there have been no defaults in any of the underlying collateral pools. Similar to other debt market instruments our maximum principal loss is limited to our original investment of $850 million as of June 30, 2008.  As in the general markets, spreads on these transactions have widened, causing unrealized losses. As of June 30, 2008, we had unrealized losses of $390 million on the $850 million in credit-linked notes. As described more fully in Note 1 of our 2007 Form 10-K, we regularly review our investment holdings for other-than-temporary impairments. Based upon this review and the information in the paragraph above, we believe that these securities were not other-than-temporarily impaired as of June 30, 2008, and December 31, 2007. The following summarizes the fair value to amortized cost ratio of the credit-linked notes:                        As ofJuly 31,2008     As ofJune 30,2008     As ofDecember 31,2007     Fair value   $ 460     $ 460     $ 660     Amortized cost     850       850       850     Fair value to amortized cost ratio     54 %     54 %     78 %  The following summarizes the exposure of the credit-linked notes’ underlying collateral by industry and rating as of June 30, 2008:                              Industry   AAA     AA     A     BBB     BB     B     Total     Financial intermediaries   0 %   7 %   2 %   1 %   1 %   0 %   11 %   Telecommunications   0 %   0 %   5 %   4 %   0 %   1 %   10 %   Oil and gas   0 %   1 %   2 %   4 %   0 %   0 %   7 %   Chemicals and plastics   0 %   0 %   3 %   1 %   0 %   0 %   4 %   Insurance   0 %   2 %   1 %   1 %   0 %   0 %   4 %   Utilities   0 %   0 %   4 %   0 %   0 %   0 %   4 %   Drugs   1 %   2 %   1 %   0 %   0 %   0 %   4 %   Monoline insurance   1 %   1 %   0 %   2 %   0 %   0 %   4 %   Retailers, except food and drug   0 %   0 %   2 %   2 %   0 %   0 %   4 %   Other industry < 4% (32 industries)   2 %   4 %   25 %   16 %   1 %   0 %   48 %                                               Total   4 %   17 %   45 %   31 %   2 %   1 %   100 %                                                104    Additional Details on our Unrealized Losses on Available-for-Sale Securities  When considering unrealized gain and loss information, it is important to recognize that the information relates to the status of securities at a particular point in time and may not be indicative of the status of our investment portfolios subsequent to the balance sheet date. Further, since the timing of the recognition of realized investment gains and losses through the selection of which securities are sold is largely at management’s discretion, it is important to consider the information provided below within the context of the overall unrealized gain or loss position of our investment portfolios. These are important considerations that should be included in any evaluation of the potential impact of unrealized loss securities on our future earnings.    105    We have no concentrations of issuers or guarantors of fixed maturity and equity securities.

represented 13.3% and 12.1% of total gross unrealized losses on all available-for-sale securities as of June 30, 2008, and December 31, 2007, respectively. Generally, below-investment-grade fixed maturity securities are more likely than investment-grade securities to develop credit concerns. The remaining 86.7% and 87.9% of the gross unrealized losses as of June 30, 2008, and December 31, 2007, respectively, relate to investment grade available-for-sale securities. The ratios of estimated fair value to amortized cost reflected in the table below were not necessarily indicative of the market value to amortized cost relationships for the securities throughout the entire time that the securities have been in an unrealized loss position nor are they necessarily indicative of these ratios subsequent to June 30, 2008.    108    Details underlying fixed maturity

information presented above is subject to rapidly changing conditions. As such, we expect that the level of securities with overall unrealized losses will fluctuate, as will the level of unrealized loss securities that are subject to enhanced analysis and monitoring. The volatility of financial market conditions results in increased recognition of both investment gains and losses, as portfolio risks are adjusted through sales and purchases. As discussed above, this is consistent with the classification of our investment portfolios as available-for-sale.    110    Mortgage Loans on Real Estate  The following summarizes key information on mortgage loans (in millions):                  As of June 30, 2008        Amount   %     Property Type           Office Building   $ 2,559   33 %   Industrial     1,988   26 %   Retail     1,852   24 %   Apartment     742   10 %   Hotel/Motel     297   4 %   Mixed Use     132   2 %   Other Commercial     108   1 %                   $ 7,678   100 %                     Geographic Region           New England   $ 193   2 %   Middle Atlantic     512   7 %   East North Central     832   11 %   West North Central     421   5 %   South Atlantic     1,806   24 %   East South Central     426   5 %   West South Central     680   9 %   Mountain     752   10 %   Pacific     2,056   27 %                   $ 7,678   100 %                              As of June 30, 2008        Amount   %     State Exposure           CA   $ 1,614   21 %   TX     628   8 %   MD     437   6 %   FL     339   4 %   TN     325   4 %   AZ     323   4 %   NC     320   4 %   VA     319   4 %   WA     302   4 %   IL     290   4 %   PA     261   3 %   GA     244   3 %   OH     221   3 %   NV     211   3 %   IN     196   3 %   NJ     148   2 %   MN     139   2 %   SC     136   2 %   MA     134   2 %   Other states 1% and under     1,091   14 %                   $ 7,678   100 %                  All mortgage loans that are impaired have an established allowance for credit loss. Changing economic conditions impact our valuation of mortgage loans. Changing vacancies and rents are incorporated into the discounted cash flow analysis that we perform for monitored loans and may contribute to the establishment of (or an increase or decrease in) an allowance for credit losses. In addition, we continue to monitor the entire commercial mortgage loan portfolio to identify risk. Areas of emphasis are properties that have deteriorating credits or have experienced debt coverage reduction. Where warranted, we have established or increased loss reserves based upon this analysis. There were no impaired mortgage loans as of June 30 2008, and December 31, 2007. As of June 30, 2008, there were no commercial mortgage loans that were two or more payments delinquent. As of December 31, 2007, we had one commercial mortgage loan that was two or more payments delinquent. The total principal and interest due on these loans as of December 31, 2007, was less than $1 million. See Note 4 for additional detail regarding impaired mortgage loans. See Note 1 in our 2007 Form 10-K for more information regarding our accounting policy relating to the impairment of mortgage loans.    111    Alternative Investments  The carrying value of our consolidated alternative investments by business segment (in millions), which consists primarily of investments in limited partnerships, were as follows:                  As ofJune 30,2008   As ofDecember 31,2007   Individual Markets:           Annuities   $ 99   $ 108   Life Insurance     584     528   Employer Markets:           Retirement Products     133     130   Other Operations     17     33                 Total alternative investments   $ 833   $ 799                Income derived from our consolidated alternative investments by business segment (in millions) was as follows:                                For the ThreeMonths EndedJune 30,   Change     For the SixMonths EndedJune 30,   Change        2008     2007     2008     2007     Individual Markets:                             Annuities   $ —      $ 11   -100 %   $ (1 )   $ 15   NM     Life Insurance     14       48   -71 %     13       58   -78 %   Employer Markets:                             Retirement Products     (1 )     11   NM       (3 )     16   NM     Other Operations     —        —    NM       (1 )     1   NM                                           Total alternative investments (1)   $ 13     $ 70   -81 %   $ 8     $ 90   -91 %                                             (1)  Includes net investment income on the alternative investments supporting the required statutory surplus of our insurance businesses.  The decline in our investment income on alternative investments presented in the table above was due to deterioration of the financial markets during the second quarter of 2008, as compared to exceptionally strong returns in the second quarter of 2007. This weakness was spread across the various categories of investments within our alternative investment portfolio.  As of June 30, 2008, and December 31, 2007, alternative investments include investments in approximately 105 and 102 different partnerships, respectively, that allow us to gain exposure to a broadly diversified portfolio of asset classes such as venture capital, hedge funds, oil and gas and real estate. The partnerships do not represent off-balance sheet financing and generally involve several third-party partners. Select partnerships contain capital calls, which require us to contribute capital upon notification by the general partner. These capital calls are contemplated during the initial investment decision and are planned for well in advance of the call date. The capital calls are not material in size and are not material to our liquidity. Alternative investments are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and are included in other investments on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Non-Income Producing Investments  As of June 30, 2008, and December 31, 2007, the carrying amount of fixed maturity securities, mortgage loans on real estate and real estate that were non-income producing was $18 million and $21 million, respectively.    112    Net Investment Income  Details underlying net investment income (in millions) and our investment yield were as follows:                                  For the ThreeMonths EndedJune 30,     Change     For the SixMonths EndedJune 30,     Change        2008     2007       2008     2007       Net Investment Income                               Fixed maturity available-for-sale securities   $ 851     $ 844     1 %   $ 1,709     $ 1,687     1 %   Equity available-for-sale securities     8       12     -33 %     17       20     -15 %   Trading securities     42       44     -5 %     85       90     -6 %   Mortgage loans on real estate     119       117     2 %     235       233     1 %   Real estate     5       12     -58 %     12       23     -48 %   Standby real estate equity commitments     1       1     0 %     2       5     -60 %   Policy loans     43       44     -2 %     88       87     1 %   Invested cash     15       17     -12 %     34       36     -6 %   Commercial mortgage loan prepayment and bond makewhole premiums (1)     14       16     -13 %     19       31     -39 %   Alternative investments (2)     13       70     -81 %     8       90     -91 %   Consent fees     2       1     100 %     2       7     -71 %   Other investments     (5 )     2     NM       (4 )     5     NM                                               Investment income     1,108       1,180     -6 %     2,207       2,314     -5 %   Investment expense     (31 )     (47 )   34 %     (65 )     (91 )   29 %                                             Net investment income   $ 1,077     $ 1,133     -5 %   $ 2,142     $ 2,223     -4 %                                                 (1)  See “Commercial Mortgage Loan Prepayment and Bond Makewhole Premiums” below for additional information.

The profitability of our fixed annuity and life insurance products is affected by our ability to achieve target spreads, or margins, between the interest income earned on the general account assets and the interest credited to the contract holder on our average fixed account values, including the fixed portion of variable. Net investment income and the     113     interest rate yield table each include commercial mortgage loan prepayments and bond makewhole premiums, alternative investments and contingent interest and standby real estate equity commitments. These items can vary significantly from period to period due to a number of factors and therefore can provide results that are not indicative of the underlying trends.  The decline in net investment income when comparing the first six months of 2008 to the same period in 2007 was largely attributable to a decline in investment income on alternative investments, which had an extraordinarily strong first half of 2007.  Commercial Mortgage Loan Prepayment and Bond Makewhole Premiums   Prepayment and makewhole premiums are collected when borrowers elect to call or prepay their debt prior to the stated maturity. A prepayment or makewhole premium allows investors to attain the same yield as if the borrower made all scheduled interest payments until maturity. These premiums are designed to make investors indifferent to prepayment.  The decline in prepayment and makewhole premiums when comparing the six months ended June 30, 2008, to 2007 was attributable primarily to the general tightening of credit conditions in the market resulting in less refinancing activity and less prepayment income.  Realized Gain (Loss) Related to Investments   The detail of the realized gain (loss) related to investments (in millions) was as follows:                                  For the ThreeMonths EndedJune 30,     Change     For the SixMonths EndedJune 30,     Change        2008     2007       2008     2007       Fixed maturity available-for-sale securities:                               Gross gains   $ 22     $ 26     -15 %   $ 31     $ 82     -62 %   Gross losses     (138 )     (46 )   NM       (238 )     (53 )   NM     Equity available-for-sale securities:                               Gross gains     —        4     -100 %     3       6     -50 %   Gross losses     (7 )     —      NM       (7 )     —      NM     Gain on other investments     3       5     -40 %     28       1     NM     Associated amortization expense of DAC, VOBA,                               DSI and DFEL and changes in other contract holder funds     24       (2 )   NM       49       (22 )   NM                                               Total realized gain (loss) on investments, excluding trading securities     (96 )     (13 )   NM       (134 )     14     NM     Gain (loss) on certain derivative instruments     (29 )     4     NM       (32 )     4     NM                                               Total realized gain (loss) on investments and certain derivative instruments, excluding trading securities   $ (125 )   $ (9 )   NM     $ (166 )   $ 18     NM                                               Write-downs for other-than-temporary impairments included in realized loss on available-for-sale securities above   $ (120 )   $ (30 )   NM     $ (211 )   $ (34 )   NM                                              Amortization expense of DAC, VOBA, DSI, DFEL and changes in other contract holder funds reflects an assumption for an expected level of credit-related investment losses. When actual credit-related investment losses are realized, we recognize a true up to our DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL amortization and changes in other contract holder funds within realized gain (loss) reflecting the incremental impact of actual versus expected credit-related investment losses. These actual to expected amortization adjustments could create volatility in net realized gains (loss). The write-down for impairments includes both credit-related and interest-rate related impairments.  Realized gains and losses generally originate from asset sales to reposition the portfolio or to respond to product experience. During the first six months of 2008 and 2007, respectively, we sold securities for gains and losses. In the process of evaluating whether a security with an unrealized loss reflects declines that are other-than-temporary, we consider our ability and intent to hold the security until its value recovers. However, subsequent decisions on securities sales are made within the context of overall risk     114     monitoring, assessing value relative to other comparable securities and overall portfolio maintenance. Although our portfolio managers may, at a given point in time, believe that the preferred course of action is to hold securities with unrealized losses that are considered temporary until such losses are recovered, the dynamic nature of portfolio management may result in a subsequent decision to sell. These subsequent decisions are consistent with the classification of our investment portfolio as available-for-sale. We expect to continue to manage all non-trading invested assets within our portfolios in a manner that is consistent with the available-for-sale classification.  We consider economic factors and circumstances within countries and industries where recent write-downs have occurred in our assessment of the status of securities we own of similarly situated issuers. While it is possible for realized or unrealized losses on a particular investment to affect other investments, our risk management has been designed to identify correlation risks and other risks inherent in managing an investment portfolio. Once identified, strategies and procedures are developed to effectively monitor and manage these risks. The areas of risk correlation that we pay particular attention to are risks that may be correlated within specific financial and business markets, risks within specific industries and risks associated with related parties.  When the detailed analysis by our credit analysts and investment portfolio managers leads to the conclusion that a security’s decline in fair value is other-than-temporary, the security is written down to estimated fair value. In instances where declines are considered temporary, the security will continue to be carefully monitored. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis – Introduction – Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” in our 2007 Form 10-K for additional information on our portfolio management strategy.  Details underlying write-downs taken as a result of other-than-temporary impairments (in millions) were as follows:                              For the ThreeMonths EndedJune 30,   Change     For the SixMonths EndedJune 30,   Change        2008   2007     2008   2007    Other-Than-Temporary Impairments                           Corporate bonds   $ 37   $ 29   28 %   $ 127   $ 33   285 %   Asset and mortgage-backed securities:     77     —    NM       78     —    NM                                       Total fixed maturity securities     114     29   293 %     205     33   NM     Equity securities     6     1   NM       6     1   NM                                       Total other-than-temporary impairments   $ 120   $ 30   300 %   $ 211   $ 34   NM                                      The $211 million of impairments taken during the first six months of 2008 are split between $155 million of credit related impairments and $56 million on non-credit related impairments. The credit related impairments are largely attributable to our RMBS and mortgage related ABS holdings that have suffered from continued deterioration in housing fundamentals. The non-credit related impairments were incurred due to declines in values of securities for which we are uncertain of our intent to hold until recovery or maturity.    115    REINSURANCE  Our insurance companies cede insurance to other companies. The portion of risks exceeding each of our insurance companies’ retention limits is reinsured with other insurers. We seek reinsurance coverage within the businesses that sell life insurance to limit our exposure to mortality losses and enhance our capital management.  Portions of our deferred annuity business have been reinsured on a modified coinsurance basis with other companies to limit our exposure to interest rate risks. As of June 30, 2008, the reserves associated with these reinsurance arrangements totaled $1.2 billion. To cover products other than life insurance, we acquire other insurance coverage with retentions and limits that management believes are appropriate for the circumstances. The consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 reflect premiums, benefits and DAC, net of insurance ceded. Our insurance companies remain liable if their reinsurers are unable to meet contractual obligations under applicable reinsurance agreements.  Our amounts recoverable from reinsurers represent receivables from and reserves ceded to reinsurers. As of June 30, 2008 and December 31, 2007, the amounts recoverable from reinsurers were $8.2 billion. We obtain reinsurance from a diverse group of reinsurers, and we monitor concentration and financial strength ratings of our principal reinsurers. Swiss Re represents our largest exposure. In 2001, we sold our reinsurance business to Swiss Re primarily through indemnity reinsurance arrangements. Because we are not relieved of our liability to the ceding companies for this business, the liabilities and obligations associated with the reinsured policies remain on our Consolidated Balance Sheets with a corresponding reinsurance receivable from the business sold to Swiss Re, which totaled $4.3 billion as of June 30, 2008, and December 31, 2007. Swiss Re has funded a trust with a balance of $1.8 billion as of June 30, 2008, to support this business. In addition to various remedies that we would have in the event of a default by Swiss Re, we continue to hold assets in support of certain of the transferred reserves. These assets consist of those reported as trading securities and certain mortgage loans. Our liabilities for funds withheld and embedded derivatives included $2.1 billion and $0.1 billion, respectively, as of June 30, 2008, related to the business sold to Swiss Re.  Included in the business sold to Swiss Re through indemnity reinsurance in 2001 was disability income business. Swiss Re is disputing its obligation to pay approximately $45 million of reinsurance recoverables on certain of this income disability business. We have agreed to arbitrate this dispute with Swiss Re. Although the outcome of the arbitration is uncertain, we currently believe that it is probable that we will ultimately collect the full amount of the reinsurance recoverable from Swiss Re and that Swiss Re will ultimately remain at risk on all of its obligations on the disability income business that it acquired from us in 2001.  On July 31, 2007, we entered into a reinsurance arrangement with Swiss Re covering Lincoln SmartSecurity® Advantage, our rider related to our Individual Market’s variable annuity products. Under the arrangement, Swiss Re provides 50% quota share coinsurance of the lifetime GWB for business written in 2007 and 2008, up to a total of $3.8 billion in rider sales. The sales level covered under this arrangement was achieved in the second quarter of 2008. The arrangement will not be renewed for new business, but this will not affect our ability to continue to write new business.  During the third quarter of 2006, one of our reinsurers, Scottish Re Group Ltd (“Scottish Re”), received rating downgrades from various rating agencies. Of the $744 million of fixed annuity business that we reinsure with Scottish Re, approximately 76% is reinsured through the use of modified coinsurance treaties, in which we possess the investments that support the reserves ceded to Scottish Re. For our annuity business ceded on a coinsurance basis, Scottish Re had previously established an irrevocable investment trust supporting the reserves for the benefit of LNC. In addition to fixed annuities, we have approximately $116 million of policy liabilities on the life insurance business that we have reinsured with Scottish Re. Scottish Re continues to perform under its contractual responsibilities to us. We continue to evaluate the impact of these rating downgrades with respect to our existing exposures to Scottish Re. Based on current information, we do not believe that Scottish Re’s rating downgrades will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity or financial condition.  As of June 30, 2008, we had reinsurance recoverables of $710 million and policy loans of $47 million that were related to the businesses of Jefferson-Pilot that are coinsured with Household International (“HI”) affiliates. HI has provided payment, performance and capital maintenance guarantees with respect to the balances receivable. We regularly evaluate the financial condition of our reinsurers and monitor concentrations of credit risk related to reinsurance activities.    116    REVIEW OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Sources of Liquidity and Cash Flow  Liquidity refers to the ability of an enterprise to generate adequate amounts of cash from its normal operations to meet cash requirements with a prudent margin of safety. Our principal sources of cash flow from operating activities are insurance premiums and fees, investment advisory fees and investment income, while sources of cash flows from investing activities result from maturities and sales of invested assets. Our operating activities provided cash of $451 million and $1.4 billion for the first six months of 2008 and 2007, respectively. The decline in cash provided by operating activities was related primarily to the timing of federal income tax payments. When considering our liquidity and cash flow, it is important to distinguish between the needs of our insurance subsidiaries and the needs of the holding company, LNC. As a holding company with no operations of its own, LNC derives its cash primarily from its operating subsidiaries.  The sources of liquidity of the holding company are principally comprised of dividends and interest payments from subsidiaries, augmented by holding company short-term investments, bank lines of credit, a commercial paper program and the ongoing availability of long-term public financing under an SEC-filed shelf registration statement. These sources of liquidity and cash flow support the general corporate needs of the holding company, including its common stock dividends, interest and debt service, funding of callable securities, securities repurchases and acquisitions.  Details underlying the primary sources of our holding company cash flows (in millions) were as follows:                           For the ThreeMonths EndedJune 30,   For the SixMonths EndedJune 30,   For theYear EndedDecember 31,2007      2008   2007   2008   2007     Dividends from Subsidiaries                       LNL   $ 100   $ 148   $ 300   $ 294   $ 769   First Penn-Pacific     50     150     50     150     150   Lincoln Financial Media     3     5     653     22     86   Delaware Investments     13     15     28     30     55   Other non-regulated companies (1)     —      —      —      —      395   Lincoln UK     24     16     24     32     75   Loan Repayments and Interest from Subsidiary                       LNL interest on intercompany notes (2)      19     20     41     41     82                                     $ 209   $ 354   $ 1,096   $ 569   $ 1,612                                   Other Cash Flow and Liquidity Items                       Net capital received from stock option exercises   $ 10   $ 29   $ 13   $ 76   $ 107                                       (1)  For the year ended December 31, 2007, amount represents a dividend of Bank of America shares to LNC from a subsidiary occurring in September 2007.     (2)  Primarily represents interest on the holding company’s $1.3 billion in surplus note investments in LNL.  The table above focuses on significant and recurring cash flow items and excludes the effects of certain financing activities, namely the periodic issuance and retirement of debt and cash flows related to our inter-company cash management account (discussed below). Taxes have been eliminated from the analysis due to a tax sharing agreement among our primary subsidiaries resulting in a modest impact on net cash flows at the holding company. Also excluded from this analysis is the modest amount of investment income on short-term investments of the holding company.    117    Subsidiaries  Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to certain insurance department regulatory restrictions as to the transfer of funds and payment of dividends to the holding company. Under Indiana laws and regulations, our Indiana insurance subsidiaries, including our primary insurance subsidiary, LNL, may pay dividends to LNC without prior approval of the Indiana Insurance Commissioner (the “Commissioner”) up to a certain threshold, or must receive prior approval of the Commissioner to pay a dividend if such dividend, along with all other dividends paid within the preceding twelve consecutive months exceed the statutory limitation. The current statutory limitation is the greater of 10% of the insurer’s contract holders’ surplus, as shown on its last annual statement on file with the Commissioner or the insurer’s statutory net gain from operations for the prior calendar year. Indiana law gives the Commissioner broad discretion to disapprove requests for dividends in excess of these limits. New York, the state of domicile of our other major insurance subsidiary, Lincoln Life & Annuity Company of New York, has similar restrictions, except that in New York it is the lesser of 10% of surplus to contract holders as of the immediately preceding calendar year or net gain from operations for the immediately preceding calendar year, not including realized capital gains.  Based upon anticipated ongoing positive statutory earnings and favorable credit markets, we expect our domestic insurance subsidiaries could pay dividends of approximately $957 million in 2008 without prior approval from the respective state commissioners. The actual amount of surplus that our insurance subsidiaries could pay as dividends is constrained by the amount of surplus we hold to maintain our ratings, to provide an additional layer of margin for risk protection and for future investment in our businesses.  Our insurance subsidiaries have statutory surplus and RBC levels well above current regulatory required levels. As mentioned earlier, more than 76% of our life sales consist of products containing secondary guarantees, which require reserving practices under AG38. Our insurance subsidiaries are employing strategies to lessen the burden of increased AG38 and Valuation of Life Insurance Policies Model Regulation (“XXX”) statutory reserves associated with certain UL products and other products with secondary guarantees subject to these statutory reserving requirements. See “Financing Activities” below for additional details. LNC will guarantee that its wholly-owned subsidiary, which reinsures a portion of the XXX reserves, will maintain a minimum level of capital and surplus, as required under the insurance laws of South Carolina, its state of domicile. The surplus maintenance agreement will remain in effect until such time that we securitize the reserves, transfer the business to an unrelated party, sell or dissolve the wholly-owned subsidiary or receive notification from the state insurance department permitting the rescission of the guarantee.  Included in the letters of credit (“LOCs”) issued as of June 30, 2008, reported in the revolving credit facilities table in “Financing Activities,” was approximately $1.2 billion of LOCs supporting the reinsurance obligations of our non-U.S. domiciled subsidiary to LNL on UL business with secondary guarantees. Recognizing that LOCs are generally one to five years in duration, it is likely that our insurance companies will apply a mix of LOCs, reinsurance and capital market strategies in addressing long-term AG38 and XXX needs. LOCs and related capital market alternatives lower the RBC impact of the UL business with secondary guarantee products. An inability to obtain the necessary LOC capacity or other capital market alternatives could impact our returns on UL business with secondary guarantee products. We are continuing to pursue capital management strategies related to our AG38 reserves involving reinsurance and securitizations. We completed our issuance of $375 million of 6.30% senior notes in the fourth quarter of 2007, which resulted in the release of approximately $300 million of capital previously supporting our UL products with secondary guarantees. See “Results of Other Operations” for additional information. We are targeting another transaction during 2008 that will finance a portion of statutory reserves related to our insurance products with secondary guarantees. In addition, a portion of our term life insurance business is reinsured with a domestic reinsurance captive as part of our overall strategy of managing the statutory capital of our insurance subsidiaries. There are no outstanding LOCs related to this business.  A new statutory reserving standard (VACARVM) is being developed by the NAIC replacing current statutory reserve practices for variable annuities with guaranteed benefits, such as GWBs. The timing for adoption of VACARVM is anticipated to occur sometime in 2008, to be effective for the year ending 2009. Because the NAIC has not determined the final version of VACARVM, we cannot estimate the ultimate impact that VACARVM will have on our liquidity and capital resources. However, in its current draft form, VACARVM has the potential to require statutory reserves well in excess of current levels for certain variable annuity riders sold by us. We plan to utilize existing captive reinsurance structures, as well as pursue additional third-party reinsurance arrangements, to lessen any negative impact on statutory capital and dividend capacity in our life insurance subsidiaries. However, additional statutory reserves could lead to lower risk-based capital ratios and potentially reduce future dividend capacity from our insurance subsidiaries. For a discussion of RBC ratios, see “Part I – Item 1. Business – Regulatory – Risk-Based Capital” in our 2007 Form 10-K.  Lincoln UK’s operations consist primarily of unit-linked life and pension products, which are similar to U.S. produced variable life and annuity products. Lincoln UK’s insurance subsidiaries are regulated by the U.K. Financial Services Authority (“FSA”) and are subject to capital requirements as defined by the U.K. Capital Resources Requirement. All insurance companies operating in the U.K. also have to complete an RBC assessment to demonstrate to the FSA that they hold sufficient capital to cover their risks.    118    RBC requirements in the U.K. are different than the NAIC requirements. In addition, the FSA has imposed certain minimum capital requirements for the combined U.K. subsidiaries. Lincoln UK typically maintains approximately 1.5 to 2 times the required capital as prescribed by the regulatory margin. As is the case with regulated insurance companies in the U.S., changes to regulatory capital requirements can impact the dividend capacity of the U.K. insurance subsidiaries and cash flow to the holding company. During the first quarter of 2008, Lincoln UK fell below its targeted capital levels due to significant increases in corporate bond spreads and restrictions imposed by the U.K. statutory valuation basis. As a result of falling below targeted capital levels, Lincoln UK did not pay dividends to the holding company. Subsequent to the first quarter, corporate bond spreads have eased, and Lincoln UK paid $24 million in dividends to LNC.  Financing Activities  Although our subsidiaries generate adequate cash flow to meet the needs of our normal operations, periodically we may issue debt or equity securities to fund internal growth, acquisitions and the retirement of our debt and equity securities.  We currently have an effective shelf registration statement, which allows us to issue, in unlimited amounts, securities, including debt securities, preferred stock, common stock, warrants, stock purchase contracts, stock purchase units and trust preferred securities of our affiliated trusts.  Details underlying debt and financing activity (in millions) were as follows:                                 For the Six Months Ended June 30, 2008      BeginningBalance   Issuance   MaturitiesandRepayments     Changein FairValueHedges     OtherChanges (1)      EndingBalance   Short-Term Debt                              Commercial paper   $ 265   $ —    $ —      $ —      $ (65 )   $ 200   Current maturities of long-term debt     285     —      (100 )     —        515       700                                               Total short-term debt   $ 550   $ —    $ (100 )   $ —      $ 450     $ 900                                               Long-Term Debt                              Senior notes   $ 2,892   $ —    $ —      $ (4 )   $ (512 )   $ 2,376   Junior subordinated debentures issued to affiliated trusts     155     —      —        —        —        155   Capital securities     1,571     —      —        —        —        1,571                                               Total long-term debt   $ 4,618   $ —    $ —      $ (4 )   $ (512 )   $ 4,102                                                   (1)  Other changes includes the net increase (decrease) in commercial paper, non-cash reclassification of long-term debt to current maturities of long-term debt, accretion of discounts and (amortization) of premiums.  Details underlying our credit facilities with a group of domestic and foreign banks (in millions) were as follows:                        As of June 30, 2008      ExpirationDate   MaximumAvailable   LoansOutstanding   Revolving Credit Facilities              Five-year revolving credit facility   March 2011   $ 1,750   $ —    Five-year revolving credit facility   February 2011     1,350     —    U.K. revolving credit facility   November 2008     20     —                     Total      $ 3,120   $ —                     Letters of credit issued          $ 1,794                 During July 2008, LNC borrowed $200 million under a new $200 million borrowing facility. The facility expires, and all outstanding loans under this facility mature, on July 18, 2013. Proceeds from this borrowing were used for general corporate purposes and to repay maturing debt.    119    The LOCs support inter-company reinsurance transactions and specific treaties associated with our former Reinsurance segment. LOCs are primarily used to satisfy the U.S. regulatory requirements of domestic clients of the former Reinsurance segment who have contracted with the reinsurance subsidiaries not domiciled in the U.S. and, as discussed above, for the reserve credit provided by our affiliated offshore reinsurance company to our domestic insurance companies for ceded business.  Under the credit agreements, we must maintain a minimum consolidated net worth level. In addition, the agreements contain covenants restricting our ability to incur liens, merge or consolidate with another entity where we are not the surviving entity and dispose of all or substantially all of our assets. As of June 30, 2008, we were in compliance with all such covenants. All of our credit agreements are unsecured.  If current debt ratings and claims paying ratings were downgraded in the future, certain covenants of various contractual obligations may be triggered which could negatively impact overall liquidity. In addition, contractual selling agreements with intermediaries could be negatively impacted which could have an adverse impact on overall sales of annuities, life insurance and investment products. As of June 30, 2008, we maintained adequate current financial strength and senior debt ratings and do not anticipate any ratings-based impact to future liquidity. See “Part I – Item 1. Business – Ratings” in our 2007 Form 10-K for additional information on our ratings.  Divestitures  For a discussion of our divestitures, see “Introduction – Acquisitions and Dispositions.”  Alternative Sources of Liquidity  In order to maximize the use of available cash, the holding company maintains an inter-company cash management account where subsidiaries can borrow from the holding company to meet their short-term needs and can invest their short-term funds with the holding company. The holding company finances this program from its primary sources of cash flow discussed above. Depending on the overall cash availability or need, the holding company invests excess cash in short-term investments or borrows funds in the financial markets.  The holding company had an average loan balance of $97 million from the cash management account during the second quarter of 2008. The holding company had a maximum and minimum amount of financing that is used from the cash management account during this period of $225 million and none, respectively.  Our insurance subsidiaries, by virtue of their general account fixed income investment holdings, can access liquidity through securities lending programs and repurchase agreements. As of June 30, 2008, our insurance subsidiaries had securities with a carrying value of $602 million out on loan under the securities lending program and $480 million carrying value subject to reverse-repurchase agreements.  LNC has a $1.0 billion commercial paper program that is rated A-1, P-2 and F-1. The commercial paper program is backed by a bank line of credit. During the second quarter of 2008, LNC had an average of $157 million in commercial paper outstanding with a maximum amount of $349 million outstanding at any time. LNC had $200 million of commercial paper outstanding as of June 30, 2008.  Uses of Capital  Our principal uses of cash are to pay policy claims and benefits, operating expenses, commissions and taxes, to purchase new investments, to purchase reinsurance, to fund policy surrenders and withdrawals, to pay dividends to our stockholders and to repurchase our stock and debt securities.    120    Return of Capital to Stockholders  One of the holding company’s primary goals is to provide a return to our stockholders. Through dividends and stock repurchases, we have an established record of providing cash returns to our stockholders. In determining dividends, the Board takes into consideration items such as current and expected earnings, capital needs, rating agency considerations and requirements for financial flexibility. Details underlying this activity (in millions, except per share data) were as follows:                                 For the ThreeMonths EndedJune 30,   Change     For the SixMonths EndedJune 30,   Change     For theYear EndedDecember 31,2007    2008   2007     2008   2007       Dividends to stockholders   $ 107   $ 108   -1 %   $ 217   $ 214   1 %   $ 430   Repurchase of common stock (1)     140     —    NM       426     512   -17 %     986                                           Total cash returned to stockholders   $ 247   $ 108   129 %   $ 643   $ 726   -11 %   $ 1,416                                           Number of shares repurchased     2.631     —    NM       8.081     7.215   12 %     15.381   Average price per share   $ 53.13   $  —    NM     $ 52.66   $ 70.92   -26 %   $ 64.13       (1)  Includes repurchases that were not settled as of June 30, 2008, of $25 million for both the three and six months ended June 30, 2008.  On November 6, 2007, the Board of Directors approved an increase in the quarterly dividend to stockholders from $0.395 per share to $0.415 per share effective in 2008.  Significant Trends in Sources and Uses of Cash Flow  As stated above, LNC’s cash flow, as a holding company, is largely dependent upon the dividend capacity and surplus note interest payments of its insurance company subsidiaries. The insurance company subsidiaries’ dividend capacity is impacted by factors influencing their risk-based capital and statutory earnings performance. Currently, we expect to have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to meet our obligations in 2008. For factors that could affect our expectations for liquidity and capital, see “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2007 Form 10-K.  OTHER MATTERS  Other Factors Affecting Our Business  In general, our businesses are subject to a changing social, economic, legal, legislative and regulatory environment. Some of the changes include initiatives to require more reserves to be carried by our insurance subsidiaries, to make permanent recent reductions in individual tax rates, to permanently repeal the estate tax and to increase regulation of our annuity and investment management businesses. Although the eventual effect on us of the changing environment in which we operate remains uncertain, these factors and others could have a material effect on our results of operations, liquidity and capital resources. For factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in this section, see “Part I – Item 1A – Risk Factors” in our 2007 Form 10-K and “Forward-looking Statements – Cautionary Language” in this report.  Recent Accounting Pronouncements  See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements that have been implemented during the periods presented or that have been issued and are to be implemented in the future.  RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES  See Note 15 in our 2007 Form 10-K for discussion of our restructuring activities.    121      Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  We analyze and manage the risks arising from market exposures of financial instruments, as well as other risks, in an integrated asset-liability management process that takes diversification into account. By aggregating the potential effect of market and other risks on the entire enterprise, we estimate, review and in some cases manage the risk to our earnings and shareholder value. We have exposures to several market risks including interest rate risk, foreign currency exchange risk, equity market risk, default risk and credit risk. The exposures of financial instruments to market risks, and the related risk management processes, are most important in the Employer Markets and Individual Markets businesses, where most of the invested assets support accumulation and investment-oriented insurance products. As an important element of our integrated asset-liability management process, we use derivatives to minimize the effects of changes in interest levels and the shape of the yield curve. In this context, derivatives are designated as a hedge and serve to reduce interest rate risk by mitigating the effect of significant increases in interest rates on our earnings. Additional market exposures exist in our other general account insurance products and in our debt structure and derivatives positions. The primary sources of market risk are: substantial, relatively rapid and sustained increases or decreases in interest rates; fluctuations in currency exchange rates; or a sharp drop in equity market values. These market risks are discussed in detail in the following pages.  Interest Rate Risk  With respect to accumulation and investment-oriented products, we seek to earn a stable and profitable spread, or margin, between investment income and interest credited to account values. If we have adverse experience on investments that cannot be passed on to customers, our spreads are reduced. Provided interest rates continue to gradually return to levels that are more typical from a long-term perspective, we do not view the near term risk to spreads over the next twelve months to be material. The combination of a probable range of interest rate changes over the next twelve months, asset-liability management strategies, flexibility in adjusting policy crediting rate levels and protection afforded by policy surrender charges and other switching costs all work together to mitigate this risk. The interest rate scenarios of concern are those in which there is a substantial, relatively rapid increase or decrease in interest rates that is then sustained over a long period.    122    Interest Rate Risk – Falling Rates  The spreads on our fixed annuity and interest-sensitive whole life, universal life (“UL”) and fixed portion of variable universal life (“VUL”) insurance policies are at risk if interest rates decline and remain low for a period of time, which has generally been the case in recent years. Should interest rates remain at current levels that are significantly lower than those existing prior to the declines of recent years, the average earned rate of return on our annuity and UL investment portfolios will continue to decline. Declining portfolio yields may cause the spreads between investment portfolio yields and the interest rate credited to contract holders to deteriorate as our ability to manage spreads can become limited by minimum guaranteed rates on annuity and UL policies. Minimum guaranteed rates on annuity and UL policies generally range from 1.5% to 5.0%, with an average guaranteed rate of approximately 4%. The following table provides detail on the percentage differences between the current interest rates being credited to contract holders and the respective minimum guaranteed policy rate, broken out by contract holder account values reported within the Employer Markets and Individual Markets businesses (in millions):                           As of June 30, 2008      Account Values          Individual Markets   EmployerMarkets –DefinedContribution   Total   Percentof TotalAccountValues      Annuities   LifeInsurance         Excess of Crediting Rates over Contract Minimums                       CD and on-benefit type annuities   $ 10,480   $ —    $ 1,477   $ 11,957   23.67 %   Discretionary rate setting products (1)                        No difference     3,237     11,872     7,227     22,336   44.21 %   up to .10%     1,603     4,196     —      5,799   11.48 %   0.11% to .20%     845     2,662     2     3,509   6.95 %   0.21% to .30%     171     202     5     378   0.75 %   0.31% to .40%     162     358     1     521   1.03 %   0.41% to .50%     55     631     1,266     1,952   3.86 %   0.51% to .60%     40     870     83     993   1.97 %   0.61% to .70%     274     43     —      317   0.63 %   0.71% to .80%     11     3     —      14   0.03 %   0.81% to .90%     2     178     —      180   0.36 %   0.91% to 1.0%     6     541     156     703   1.39 %   1.01% to 1.50%     53     203     29     285   0.56 %   1.51% to 2.00%     432     347     176     955   1.89 %   2.01% to 2.50%     425     3     —      428   0.85 %   2.51% to 3.00%     —      —      12     12   0.02 %   3.01% and above     —      —      178     178   0.35 %                                   Total discretionary rate setting products     7,316     22,109     9,135     38,560   76.33 %                                   Total account values   $ 17,796   $ 22,109   $ 10,612   $ 50,517   100.00 %                                       (1)  Contracts currently within new money rate bands are grouped according to the corresponding portfolio rate band in which they will fall upon their first anniversary.  The maturity structure and call provisions of the related portfolios are structured to afford protection against erosion of investment portfolio yields during periods of declining interest rates. We devote extensive effort to evaluating the risks associated with falling interest rates by simulating asset and liability cash flows for a wide range of interest rate scenarios. We seek to manage these exposures by maintaining a suitable maturity structure and by limiting our exposure to call risk in each respective investment portfolio.    123    Interest Rate Risk – Rising Rates  For both annuities and UL, a rapid and sustained rise in interest rates poses risks of deteriorating spreads and high surrenders. The portfolios supporting these products have fixed-rate assets laddered over maturities generally ranging from one to ten years or more. Accordingly, the earned rate on each portfolio lags behind changes in market yields. As rates rise, the lag may be increased by slowing mortgage-backed securities prepayments. The greater and faster the rise in interest rates, the more the earned rate will tend to lag behind market rates. If we set renewal crediting rates to earn the desired spread, the gap between our renewal crediting rates and competitors’ new money rates may be wide enough to cause increased surrenders that could cause us to liquidate a portion of our portfolio to fund these surrenders. If we credit more competitive renewal rates to limit surrenders, our spreads will narrow. We devote extensive effort to evaluating these risks by simulating asset and liability cash flows for a wide range of interest rate scenarios. Such analysis has led to adjustments in the target maturity structure and to hedging the risk of rising rates by buying out-of-the-money interest rate cap agreements and swaptions. With these instruments in place, the potential adverse impact of a rapid and sustained rise in rates is kept within our risk tolerances.  Debt  We manage the timing of maturities and the mixture of fixed-rate and floating-rate debt as part of the process of integrated management of interest rate risk for the entire enterprise.  Derivatives   We have entered into derivative transactions to reduce our exposure to rapid changes in interest rates. The derivative programs are used to help us achieve more stable margins while providing competitive crediting rates to policyholders during periods when interest rates are changing. Such derivatives include interest rate swaps, interest rate futures, interest rate caps and treasury locks. During the first six months of 2008, the more significant changes in our derivative positions were as follows:      •    Interest rate swap agreements hedging floating rate bond coupon payments with a notional amount of $400 million matured or terminated, resulting in a remaining notional amount of $635 million. A loss of $6 million was recognized on the terminations. We also entered into $2 billion notional amount of interest rate swap agreements hedging a portion of the liability exposure on certain options in our variable annuity products, resulting in a total notional amount of $6.7 billion. These interest rate swap agreements convert floating rate bond coupon payments into a fixed rate of return;      •    Interest rate swap agreements hedging fixed rate bond coupon payments with a notional amount of $6 million terminated, resulting in a remaining notional amount of $298 million. A loss of less than $1 million was recognized on the terminations. These interest rate swap agreements are used to hedge our exposure to fixed rate bond coupon payments and the change in underlying asset values as interest rates fluctuate;      •    Interest rate cap agreements with a notional amount of $450 million matured, resulting in a remaining notional amount of $3.7 billion. These interest rate cap agreements are used to hedge our annuity business against a negative impact of a significant and sustained rise in interest rates; and      •    We entered into and terminated forward-starting interest rate swap agreements with a notional amount of $230 million and $230 million, respectively, resulting in a remaining notional amount of $50 million. These swaps are used to hedge interest rate risk associated with assets that support our annuity liabilities. A loss of $3 million was recognized on certain terminations and was reported in other comprehensive income (“OCI”). The loss will be reclassified from accumulated OCI recognized in income over the life of the purchased assets. A loss of $1 million was recognized on other terminations and was recorded in net income as benefits.  In addition to continuing existing programs, we may use derivative instruments in other strategies to limit risk and enhance returns, particularly in the management of investment spread businesses. We have established policies, guidelines and internal control procedures for the use of derivatives as tools to enhance management of the overall portfolio of risks assumed in our operations. Annually, our Board of Directors reviews our derivatives policy.  Foreign Currency Exchange Risk  Foreign Currency Denominated Investments  We invest in foreign currency securities for incremental return and risk diversification relative to United States Dollar-Denominated (“USD”) securities. We use foreign currency swaps and foreign currency forwards to hedge some of the foreign exchange risk related to our investment in securities denominated in foreign currencies. The currency risk is hedged using foreign currency derivatives of the same currency as the bonds.  We use foreign currency swaps to convert the cash flow of foreign currency securities to U.S. dollars. A foreign currency swap is a contractual agreement to exchange the currencies of two different countries at a specified rate of exchange in the future.  We use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge dividends received from our U.K. based subsidiary, Lincoln UK. The foreign currency forward contracts obligate us to deliver a specified amount of currency at a future date and a specified exchange rate.    124    During the first six months of 2008, a significant change in our foreign currency derivative positions was as follows:      •    We entered into and terminated foreign exchange forward contracts with a notional amount of $48 million and $48 million, respectively, resulting in no remaining notional amount. These contracts are hedging dividends received from our Lincoln UK subsidiary. A loss of less than $1 million was recognized on the terminations.  Equity Market Risk  Our revenues, assets, liabilities and derivatives are exposed to equity market risk. Due to the use of our reversion to the mean (“RTM”) process and our hedging strategies, we expect that, in general, short-term fluctuations in the equity markets should not have a significant impact on our quarterly earnings from unlocking of assumptions for deferred acquisition costs (“DAC”), deferred sales inducements (“DSI”), value of business acquired (“VOBA”) and deferred front-end sales loads (“DFEL”). However, there is an impact to earnings from the effects of equity market movements on account values and assets under management and the related fees we earn on those assets.  Fee Revenues  The fee revenues of our Investment Management segment and fees earned from variable annuities and variable life insurance products are exposed to the risk of a decline in equity market values. These fees are generally a fixed percentage of the market value of assets under management. In a severe equity market decline, fee income could be reduced by not only reduced market valuations but also by customer withdrawals and redemptions. Such withdrawals and redemptions from equity funds and accounts might be partially offset by transfers to our fixed-income accounts and the transfer of funds to us from our competitors’ customers.  Assets and Liabilities  While we invest in equity assets with the expectation of achieving higher returns than would be available in our core fixed-income investments, the returns on, and values of, these equity investments are subject to somewhat greater market risk than our fixed-income investments. These investments, however, add diversification benefits to our fixed-income investments.  We have exposure to changes in our stock price through stock appreciation rights issued. This program is being hedged with equity derivatives.  Derivatives Hedging Equity Market Risk  During the first six months of 2008, the more significant changes in our derivative positions hedging equity market risk were as follows:      •    We had less than one million call options on an equal number of shares of Lincoln National Corporation (“LNC”) stock hedging the increase in liabilities arising from stock appreciation rights granted on LNC stock;      •    We entered into and terminated variance swaps used to hedge the liability exposure on certain options in variable annuity products with a notional amount of $25 million and $2 million, respectively, resulting in a remaining notional amount of $29 million;       •    We entered into Standard & Poor’s (“S&P”) 500 Index® call options with a notional amount of $1.2 billion, call options with a notional amount of $1 billion expired, resulting in a remaining notional amount of $3 billion to hedge the impact of the equity-index interest credited to our equity annuity products;      •    We entered into and terminated put option agreements with a notional amount of $825 million and $400 million, respectively, resulting in a remaining notional amount of $4.5 billion to hedge a portion of the liability exposure on certain options in our variable annuity products; and      •    We had net purchases and terminations in financial futures with a notional amount of $1 billion, resulting in a remaining notional amount of $1.6 billion to hedge a portion of the liability exposure on certain options in variable annuity products.    125    Impact of Equity Market Sensitivity  Due to the use of our RTM process and our hedging strategies as described in “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” in our 2007 Form 10-K, we expect that in general, short-term fluctuations in the equity markets should not have a significant impact on our quarterly earnings from unlocking of assumptions for DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL, as we do not unlock our long-term equity market assumptions based upon short-term fluctuations in the equity markets. However, there is an impact to earnings from the effects of equity market movements on account values and assets under management and the related asset-based fees we earn on those assets net of related expenses we incur based upon the level of assets. The table below presents our estimate of the annual, after-tax, after-DAC, impact on income from operations, from both a 1% and 10% decline in the equity markets (in millions), excluding any impact related to sales, prospective and retrospective unlocking, persistency, hedge program performance or customer behavior caused by the equity market change:                 Segment    Relevant Measure   Impact per1% Change   Impact per10% Change  Investment Management   Composite of Equity Assets (1)   $ 1   $ 14       Individual Markets – Annuities   Average daily change in the S&P 500     3     38       Employer Markets – Defined Contribution   Average daily change in the S&P 500     1     12       Lincoln UK   Average daily change in the FTSE 100     —      4       (1)  The Investment Management segment manages equity-based assets of varying styles (growth, value, blend and international) and underlying products (mutual funds, institutional accounts, insurance separate accounts, etc.). No single equity benchmark is an accurate predictor of the change in earnings for this segment and the earnings impact summarized above includes the return on seed capital.  The impact on earnings summarized above is an expected annual effect. The result of the above factors should be multiplied by 25% to arrive at an estimated quarterly effect. The effect of quarterly equity market changes upon fee revenues and asset-based expenses will not be fully recognized in the current quarter due to the fact that fee revenues are earned and related expenses are incurred based upon daily variable account values. The difference between the current period average daily variable account values compared to the end of period variable account values impacts fee revenues in subsequent periods. Additionally, the impact on earnings may not necessarily be symmetrical with comparable increases in the equity markets. This discussion concerning the estimated effects of ongoing equity market volatility on the fees we earn from account values and assets under management is intended to be illustrative. Actual effects may vary depending on a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control, such as changing customer behaviors that might result in changes in the mix of our business between variable and fixed annuity contracts, switching among investment alternatives available within variable products, changes in sales production levels or changes in policy persistency. For purposes of this guidance, the change in account values is assumed to correlate with the change in the relevant index.  Default Risk  Our portfolio of invested assets was $70.2 billion and $71.9 billion as of June 30, 2008, and December 31, 2007, respectively. Of this total, $44.5 billion and $46.1 billion consist of corporate bonds and $7.7 billion and $7.4 billion consist of commercial mortgages as of June 30, 2008, and December 31, 2007, respectively. We manage the risk of adverse default experience on these investments by applying disciplined credit evaluation and underwriting standards, prudently limiting allocations to lower-quality, higher-yielding investments and diversifying exposures by issuer, industry, region and property type. For each counterparty or borrowing entity and its affiliates, our exposures from all transactions are aggregated and managed in relation to formal limits set by rating quality and industry group. We remain exposed to occasional adverse cyclical economic downturns during which default rates may be significantly higher than the long-term historical average used in pricing.  We are depending on the ability of derivative product dealers and their guarantors to honor their obligations to pay the contract amounts under various derivatives agreements. In order to minimize the risk of default losses, we diversify our exposures among several dealers and limit the amount of exposure to each in accordance with the credit rating of each dealer or its guarantor. We generally limit our selection of counterparties that are obligated under these derivative contracts to those with an A credit rating or above.    126    Credit-Related Derivatives  We use various credit-related derivatives to minimize exposure to various credit-related risks. We use credit default swaps to hedge against a drop in bond prices due to credit concerns of certain bond issuers. A credit default swap allows us to put the bond back to the counterparty at par upon a default event by the bond issuer. A default event is defined as bankruptcy, failure to pay or obligation acceleration. As of June 30, 2008, and December 31, 2007, we had no purchased credit default swaps outstanding.  We also sell credit default swaps to offer credit protection to investors. The credit default swaps hedge the investor against a drop in bond prices due to credit concerns of certain bond issuers. A credit swap allows the investor to put the bond back to us at par upon a default event by the bond issuer. As of June 30, 2008, and December 31, 2007, we had credit default swaps with a notional amount of $82 million and $60 million, which expire in 2010 through 2017.  Credit Risk   By using derivative instruments, we are exposed to credit risk (our counterparty fails to make payment) and market risk (the value of the instrument falls and we are required to make a payment). When the fair value of a derivative contract is positive, this generally indicates that the counterparty owes us and, therefore, creates a credit risk for us equal to the extent of the fair value gain in the derivative. When the fair value of a derivative contract is negative, this generally indicates we owe the counterparty and therefore we have no credit risk, but have been affected by market risk. We minimize the credit risk in derivative instruments by entering into transactions with high quality counterparties with minimum credit ratings that are reviewed regularly by us, by limiting the amount of credit exposure to any one counterparty, and by requiring certain counterparties to post collateral if our credit risk exceeds certain limits. We also maintain a policy of requiring all derivative contracts to be governed by an International Swaps and Derivatives Association (“ISDA”) Master Agreement. We do not believe that the credit or market risks associated with derivative instruments are material to any insurance subsidiary or the Company.      Item 4. Controls and Procedures  Conclusions Regarding Disclosure Controls and Procedures  We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, which are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As of the end of the period covered by this report, we, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as that term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting them to material information relating to us and our consolidated subsidiaries required to be disclosed in our periodic reports under the Exchange Act.  Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting  There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as that term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended June 30, 2008, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.  A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the company have been detected. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.    127    PART II – OTHER INFORMATION      Item 1.
