Item 1A. Risk Factors,” “Part II – Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and “Part II – Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data”; our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q filed in 2009; and our current reports on Form 8-K filed in 2009.  See Note 2 for a detailed discussion of how the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards CodificationTM (“ASC”) is now the single source of authoritative United States of America generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) recognized by the FASB. Accordingly, we have revised all references to GAAP accounting standards in this filing to reflect the appropriate references in the new FASB ASC.   In this report, in addition to providing consolidated revenues and net income (loss), we also provide segment operating revenues and income (loss) from operations because we believe they are meaningful measures of revenues and the profitability of our operating segments. Income (loss) from operations is net income recorded in accordance with GAAP excluding the after-tax effects of the following items, as applicable:      ·   Realized gains and losses associated with the following (“excluded realized loss”):            §   Sale or disposal of securities;            §   Impairments of securities;            §   Change in the fair value of embedded derivatives within certain reinsurance arrangements and the change in the fair value of our trading securities;            §   Net difference between the portion of the change in reserves accounted for under the Financial Services – Insurance – Claim Costs and Liabilities for Future Policy Benefits Subtopic of the FASB ASC resulting from benefit ratio unlocking (“benefit ratio reserves”) of our guaranteed death benefit (“GDB”) riders within our variable annuities and the change in the fair value of the derivatives we own to hedge the changes in the benefit ratio reserves, excluding our expected cost of purchasing the hedging instruments, the net of which is referred to as “GDB derivatives results”;            §   Change in the fair value of the embedded derivatives of our guaranteed living benefit (“GLB”) riders within our variable annuities accounted for under the Derivatives and Hedging and the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topics of the FASB ASC (“embedded derivative reserves”) and GLB benefit ratio reserves, net of the change in the fair value of the derivatives we own to hedge the changes in the embedded derivative reserves, the net of which is referred to as “GLB net derivative results”; and            §   Changes in the fair value of the embedded derivative liabilities related to index call options we may purchase in the future to hedge contract holder index allocations applicable to future reset periods for our indexed annuity products accounted for under the Derivatives and Hedging and the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topics of the FASB ASC (“indexed annuity forward-starting option”).        ·   Income (loss) from the initial adoption of new accounting standards;        ·   Income (loss) from reserve changes (net of related amortization) on business sold through reinsurance;        ·   Gains (losses) on early retirement of debt;        ·   Losses from the impairment of intangible assets; and        ·   Income (loss) from discontinued operations.     Operating revenues represent GAAP revenues excluding the pre-tax effects of the following items, as applicable:      ·   Excluded realized loss;        ·   Amortization of deferred gains arising from the reserve changes on business sold through reinsurance; and        ·   Revenue adjustments from the initial adoption of new accounting standards.           61          Operating revenues and income (loss) from operations are the financial performance measures we use to evaluate and assess the results of our segments. Accordingly, we report operating revenues and income (loss) from operations by segment in Note 17. Our management and Board of Directors believe that operating revenues and income (loss) from operations explain the results of our ongoing businesses in a manner that allows for a better understanding of the underlying trends in our current businesses because the excluded items are unpredictable and not necessarily indicative of current operating fundamentals or future performance of the business segments, and, in many instances, decisions regarding these items do not necessarily relate to the operations of the individual segments. In addition, we believe that our definitions of operating revenues and income (loss) from operations will provide investors with a more valuable measure of our performance because it better reveals trends in our business. Operating revenues and income (loss) from operations do not replace revenues and net income as the GAAP measures of our consolidated results of operations.

INTRODUCTION  Executive Summary  We are a holding company that operates multiple insurance businesses through subsidiary companies. Through our business segments, we sell a wide range of wealth protection, accumulation and retirement income products and solutions. These products include institutional and/or retail fixed and indexed annuities, variable annuities, universal life insurance (“UL”), variable universal life insurance (“VUL”), linked-benefit UL, term life insurance and mutual funds.  We provide products and services in two operating businesses and report results through four business segments as follows:       Business    Corresponding Segments     Retirement Solutions   Annuities      Defined Contribution         Insurance Solutions   Life Insurance      Group Protection      These operating businesses and their segments are described in “Part I – Item 1. Business” of our 2008 Form 10-K.  We also have Other Operations, which includes the financial data for operations that are not directly related to the business segments. Other Operations also includes our run-off Institutional Pension business, the results of certain disability income business due to the rescission of this business previously sold to Swiss Re and the results of our remaining media businesses.  Our former Lincoln UK and Investment Management segments are reported in discontinued operations for all periods presented.        63          Current Market Conditions  Subsequent to the first quarter of 2009, the capital and credit markets showed signs of improvement following a period of extreme volatility and disruption that affected both equity market returns and interest rates. During this period, credit spreads widened across asset classes and reduced liquidity in the credit markets. The price of our common stock steadily increased during the second and third quarters of 2009 to close at $25.91 on September 30, 2009, as compared to $18.84 on December 31, 2008, after having traded at a low of $4.90 during the first quarter of 2009. Analysts and economists noted in January 2009 that the U.S. economy lost more jobs in 2008 than in any year subsequent to World War II and projected that the economic recovery might take longer than previously expected. We also experienced a series of ratings downgrades primarily from February 2009 to May 2009 as depressed capital markets continued to strain our liquidity as we prepared to fund debt maturities in the second quarter of 2009; however, during June of 2009 and following the announcement about our planned capital actions discussed below, all four of the major independent rating agencies affirmed our financial strength ratings, and Standard & Poor’s (“S&P”) improved its outlook on our company to stable from negative.  Earnings will continue to be unfavorably impacted by the prior significant decline in the equity markets. Due to these challenges, the capital markets had a significant effect on our segment income (loss) from operations and consolidated net income during the first nine months of 2009. In the face of these capital market challenges, we continue to focus on building our businesses through these difficult markets and beyond by developing and introducing high quality products, expanding distribution in new and existing key accounts and channels and targeting market segments that have high growth potential while maintaining a disciplined approach to managing our expenses. During the third quarter of 2009, we experienced modestly lower deposits but significantly higher net flows than in the corresponding period of 2008.  The markets have primarily impacted the following areas:  Adequacy of Our Liquidity and Capital Positions  We are committed to managing our capital effectively. The continued adequacy of our liquidity resources to meet requirements of our businesses and our holding company depends upon such factors as market conditions and our ability to access sources of liquidity. In addition, market volatility impacts the level of capital required to support our businesses.  Given this dynamic and challenging environment, we have taken measures to prudently and actively manage our liquidity and capital positions. As discussed in “Review of Consolidated Financial Condition – Liquidity and Capital Resources – Sources of Liquidity and Cash Flow – Financing Activities,” we issued $690 million of common stock and $500 million of senior notes during the second quarter of 2009 and issued $950 million preferred stock and a common stock warrant through the U.S. Treasury’s TARP CPP in the third quarter of 2009, as discussed below in “TARP CPP.” These actions compliment our past actions of reducing the dividend on our common stock, suspending stock repurchase activity, restructuring the company to reduce overall expenses and entering into a reinsurance transaction to increase statutory capital for our primary insurance subsidiary.  Currently, we expect to meet the ongoing cash needs of the holding company for the foreseeable future as a result of the raising of $2.1 billion as part of several capital transactions and in combination with expense savings and sales discussed below in “Acquisitions and Dispositions.” We also expect to maintain more liquidity at the holding company as compared to prior years.  For more information on our liquidity and capital positions, see “Review of Consolidated Financial Condition” below.  Earnings from Account Values  Our asset-gathering segments – Retirement Solutions – Annuities and Retirement Solutions – Defined Contribution – are the most sensitive to the equity markets. We discuss the earnings impact of the equity markets on account values and the related asset-based earnings below in “Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – Equity Market Risk – Impact of Equity Market Sensitivity.” From December 31, 2008, to September 30, 2009, our account values were up $19 billion driven by strong deposits, positive net flows and recent improvements in the equity markets. The effect of the negative equity markets on our account values that subsided in the second quarter of 2009 will continue to dampen our earnings in 2009 even if the equity market returns become consistent with our long-term assumptions. While our ending variable account values as of September 30, 2009, were modestly higher than as of September 30, 2008, the daily average account values for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2009, were much lower than the corresponding period in the prior year, consistent with the reduction in our asset-based earnings. Accordingly, we may continue to report lower asset-based fees, higher DAC and VOBA amortization and higher reserves related to our GDB guarantees relative to expectations or prior periods.        64          Investment Income on Alternative Investments  We believe that overall market conditions in both the equity and credit markets caused our alternative investments portfolio, which consists primarily of hedge funds and various limited partnership investments, to under-perform relative to our long-term return expectations, and we expect these assets to continue to under-perform at least in the short term. During the first nine months of 2009, the most significant unfavorable impact from these investments was related to audit adjustments from the completion of calendar-year financial statement audits of our investees, determined and recognized during the second quarter of 2009. The audit reports that we received for these investees reflected a lower equity balance than the unaudited financial statements that we had been provided previously that were used as the basis for valuation at year end 2008 and the first quarter of 2009. These investments impact primarily our Insurance Solutions – Life Insurance segment and to a lesser extent our Retirement Solutions – Annuities and Retirement Solutions – Defined Contribution segments. See “Consolidated Investments – Alternative Investments” for additional information on our investment portfolio and further discussion on the nature of the audit adjustments referred to above.  Variable Annuity Hedge Program Results  We offer variable annuity products with living benefit guarantees. As described below in “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Derivatives – Guaranteed Living Benefits,” we use derivative instruments to hedge our exposure to the risks and earnings volatility that result from the GLB embedded derivatives in certain of our variable annuity products. The change in fair value of these instruments tends to move in the opposite direction of the change in embedded derivative reserves. For the first nine months of 2009, impacts of changes in interest rate risk unfavorably affected the net change in GLB embedded derivative reserves, excluding the effect of our non-performance risk (“NPR”), and the change in fair value of the hedging derivatives. This impact was heightened as a result of our decision not to hedge all of the interest rate risk in response to the pending adoption of VACARVM, which is discussed further below.  The NPR factors result in an additional amount added to the discount rate in the calculation of the GLB embedded derivative reserve. The NPR factors are impacted by our holding company’s credit default swap (“CDS”) spreads adjusted for items, such as the liquidity of our holding company CDS. Because the guaranteed benefit liabilities are contained within our insurance subsidiaries, we apply items, such as the impact of our insurance subsidiaries’ claims-paying ratings compared to holding company credit risk and the over-collateralization of insurance liabilities, in order to determine factors that are representative of a theoretical market participant’s view of the NPR of the specific liability within our insurance subsidiaries. This had an unfavorable effect during the first nine months of 2009 attributable to narrowing of credit spreads. These results are excluded from the Retirement Solutions – Annuities and Defined Contribution segments’ operating revenues and income from operations. See “Realized Loss – Operating Realized Gain (Loss) – GLB” for information on our methodology for calculating the NPR.  We also offer variable products with death benefit guarantees. As described in “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Future Contract Benefits and Other Contract Holder Obligations – Guaranteed Death Benefits” in our 2008 Form 10-K, we use derivative instruments to attempt to hedge in the opposite direction of the changes in our associated GDB benefit ratio reserves for movements in equity markets. These results are excluded from income (loss) from operations.  Variable Annuity Business Model  In order to address the realities of the current market conditions in the variable annuity marketplace, in late January 2009, we introduced changes to our GLB riders including increased rider fees, reduced roll-up periods and tighter investment restrictions on new business and a large percentage of in-force account value. Increased equity market implied volatility and falling interest rates have increased the cost of providing GLBs. The January product changes reduce our exposure to equity market volatility and interest rate movements while compensating us for increasing costs to provide the benefits.  Credit Losses, Impairments and Unrealized Losses  Related to our investments in fixed income and equity securities, we experienced net realized losses which reduced net income by $82 million and $238 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2009, and included credit related write-downs of securities for other-than-temporary impairments (“OTTI”) of $52 million and $207 million, respectively. Although economic conditions have improved, we expect a continuation of some level of OTTI. If we were to experience another period of weakness in the economic environment like we did in late 2008 and early 2009, it could lead to increased credit defaults, resulting in additional write-downs of securities for OTTI.        65          Increased liquidity in several market segments and improved credit fundamentals (i.e., market improvement and narrowing credit spreads) as of September 30, 2009, compared to December 31, 2008, has resulted in the $4.3 billion decrease in gross unrealized losses on the available-for-sale (“AFS”) fixed maturity securities in our general account as of September 30, 2009. Our unrealized losses are concentrated in the investment grade category of investments and demonstrate how reduced liquidity in the credit markets has impacted asset values.  Stimulus Legislation  In reaction to the recession, credit market illiquidity and global financial crisis experienced during the latter part of 2008 and into 2009, Congress enacted the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (“EESA”) on October 3, 2008, and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (“ARRA”) which was signed into law on February 17, 2009, in an effort to restore liquidity to the U.S. credit markets and stimulate the U.S. economy. The ARRA and TARP authorized the purchase of “troubled assets” from financial institutions, including insurance companies. Pursuant to the authority granted under the TARP, the U.S. Treasury also adopted the CPP, the Generally Available Capital Access Program and the Exceptional Financial Recovery Assistance Program. It remains unclear at this point, if and when the EESA and ARRA will restore sustained liquidity and confidence in the markets and its affect on the fair value of our invested assets.   TARP CPP  On November 13, 2008, we filed an application to participate in the CPP that was established under the EESA. On January 8, 2009, the Office of Thrift Supervision approved our application to become a savings and loan holding company and our acquisition of Newton County Loan & Savings, FSB, a federally regulated savings bank, located in Indiana. We contributed $10 million to the capital of Newton County Loan & Savings, FSB, and closed on the purchase on January 15, 2009. On May 8, 2009, the U.S. Treasury granted us preliminary approval to participate in the CPP. On July 10, 2009, we issued, in a private placement, $950 million of Series B preferred stock and a warrant for 13,049,451 shares of our common stock with an exercise price of $10.92 per share to the U.S. Treasury under the CPP. See “Review of Consolidated Financial Condition – Liquidity and Capital Resources – Sources of Liquidity and Cash Flow – Financing Activities” for more information about our preferred stock issuance.  Participation in the CPP subjects us to increased oversight by the U.S. Treasury. The U.S. Treasury has the power to unilaterally amend the terms of the purchase agreement to the extent required to comply with changes in applicable statutes and to inspect our corporate books and records through our federal banking regulators. In addition, the U.S. Treasury has the right to appoint two directors to our Board if we miss dividend payments on the preferred stock as discussed below. Participation in the CPP may also subject us to increased Congressional scrutiny.  In connection with participating in the CPP, we registered as a savings and loan holding company, which subjects us to new legal and regulatory requirements, including minimum capital requirements, and subjects us to oversight, regulation and examination by the Office of Thrift Supervision.  We are also subject to certain restrictions, notably, limits on incentive compensation for certain executives and employees for the duration of the U.S. Treasury’s investment. We are also subject to limits on increasing the dividend on our common stock and redeeming capital stock (unless the U.S. Treasury consents), both of which apply until the third anniversary of the U.S. Treasury’s investment unless we redeem the Series B preferred shares in whole or the U.S. Treasury transfers all of the Series B preferred stock to third parties.  The U.S. Treasury will not vote the Series B preferred stock or the common stock it may receive upon exercise of the warrant. However, with respect to the Series B preferred stock, the U.S. Treasury would have class voting rights on the issuance of shares ranking senior to the Series B preferred stock, amendments to the rights of the Series B preferred stock or any merger, exchange or similar transaction that would adversely affect the rights of the Series B preferred stock. If dividends on the Series B preferred stock are not paid in full for six dividend periods, whether or not consecutive, the Series B preferred stock holders will have the right, together with the holders of any other affected classes of future parity stock, voting as a single class, to elect two directors.  Under current CPP documentation, if we receive aggregate cash proceeds equal to not less than 100% of the aggregate liquidation preference of the Series B preferred stock sold to the U.S. Treasury from the sale of shares of common stock, perpetual preferred stock or any combination of such securities after the closing of our CPP transaction and on or prior to December 31, 2009, the number of shares of common stock underlying the warrant held by the U.S. Treasury will be reduced by half. In addition, under current guidance, after redeeming the Series B preferred stock, we will have the right to repurchase the warrant for its appraised market value, and if we do not repurchase the warrant, the U.S. Treasury can liquidate the warrant. In addition, we have granted the U.S. Treasury registration rights covering the shares of Series B preferred stock, the warrant and the shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of the warrant.       66          Challenges and Outlook  For the remainder of 2009, we expect major challenges to include:      ·   Unstable credit markets that impact our financing alternatives, spreads and other-than-temporary securities impairments;        ·   Volatile equity markets that have a significant impact on our hedge program performance and revenues;        ·   Continuation of the low interest rate environment, which affects the investment margins and reserve levels for many of our products, such as fixed annuities and UL;        ·   Possible additional intangible asset impairments, such as goodwill, if the financial performance of our reporting units deteriorates, our market capitalization remains below book value for a prolonged period of time or business valuation assumptions (such as discount rates and equity market volatility) are adversely affected;        ·   Achieving continued sales success with our portfolio of products, including marketplace acceptance of new variable annuity features, as well as retaining management and wholesaler talent to maintain our competitive position; and        ·   Continuing focus by the government on tax and healthcare reform including potential changes in company dividends-received deduction (“DRD”) calculations, which may affect the value and profitability of our products and overall earnings.     In the face of these challenges, we expect to focus on the following throughout the remainder of 2009:      ·   Increase our product development activities together with identifying future product development initiatives, with a focus on further reducing risk related to guaranteed benefit riders available on with certain variable annuity contracts;        ·   Manage our expenses aggressively through cost reduction and process improvement initiatives combined with continued financial discipline and execution excellence throughout our operations;        ·   Execute on financing strategies addressing the statutory reserve strain related to our secondary guarantee UL products in order to manage our capital position effectively in accordance with our pricing guidelines; and        ·   Closely monitor our capital and liquidity positions taking into account the fragile economic recovery and changing statutory accounting and reserving practices.     For additional factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in this section, see “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2008 Form 10-K and “Forward-Looking Statements – Cautionary Language” in this report.  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  The MD&A included in our 2008 Form 10-K contains a detailed discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates. The following information updates the “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” provided in our 2008 Form 10-K and, accordingly, should be read in conjunction with the “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” discussed in our 2008 Form 10-K.  DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL  On a quarterly basis, we may record an adjustment to the amounts included within our Consolidated Balance Sheets for DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL with an offsetting benefit or charge to revenue or expense for the impact of the difference between future estimated gross profits (“EGPs”) used in the prior quarter and the emergence of actual and updated future EGPs in the current quarter (“retrospective unlocking”). In addition, in the third quarter of each year, we conduct our annual comprehensive review of the assumptions and the projection models used for our estimates of future gross profits underlying the amortization of DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL and the calculations of the embedded derivatives and reserves for annuity and life insurance products with living benefit and death benefit guarantees. These assumptions include investment margins, mortality, retention, rider utilization and maintenance expenses (costs associated with maintaining records relating to insurance and individual and group annuity contracts and with the processing of premium collections, deposits, withdrawals and commissions). Based on our review, the cumulative balances of DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL, included on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, are adjusted with an offsetting benefit or charge to revenue or amortization expense to reflect such change (“prospective unlocking – assumption changes”). We may also identify and implement actuarial modeling refinements (“prospective unlocking – model refinements”) that result in increases or decreases to the carrying values of DAC, VOBA, DSI, DFEL, embedded derivatives and reserves for annuity and life insurance products with living benefit and death benefit guarantees. The primary distinction between retrospective and prospective unlocking is that retrospective unlocking is driven by the difference between actual gross profits compared to EGPs each period, while prospective unlocking is driven by changes in assumptions or projection models related to our projections of future EGPs.        67          In discussing our results of operations below in this MD&A, we refer to favorable and unfavorable unlocking. With respect to DAC, VOBA and DSI, favorable unlocking refers to a decrease in the amortization expense in the period, whereas unfavorable unlocking refers to an increase in the amortization expense in the period. With respect to DFEL, favorable unlocking refers to an increase in the amortization income in the period, whereas unfavorable unlocking refers to a decrease in the amortization income in the period. With respect to the calculations of the embedded derivatives and reserves for annuity and life insurance products with living benefit and death benefit guarantees, favorable unlocking refers to a decrease in reserves in the period, whereas unfavorable unlocking refers to an increase in reserves in the period.  For illustrative purposes, the following presents the hypothetical impacts to EGP and DAC (1) amortization attributable to changes in assumptions from those our model projections assume, assuming all other factors remain constant:                Hypothetical                        Hypothetical     Impact to                    Actual Experience Differs     Impact to      Net Income                    From Those Our Model      Net Income     for DAC (1)                    Projections Assume      for EGPs     Amortization     Description of Expected Impact        Higher equity markets     Favorable     Favorable     Increase to fee income and decrease to changes in                reserves.

Under our current RTM process, on each valuation date, future EGPs are projected using stochastic modeling of a large number of future equity market scenarios in conjunction with best estimates of lapse rates, interest rate spreads and mortality to develop a statistical distribution of the present value of future EGPs for our variable annuity, annuity-based 401(k) and VUL blocks of business. Because future equity market returns are unpredictable, the underlying premise of this process is that best estimate projections of future EGPs need not be affected by random short-term and insignificant deviations from expectations in equity market returns. However, long-term or significant deviations from expected equity market returns require a change to best estimate projections of EGPs and prospective unlocking of DAC, VOBA, DSI, DFEL and changes in future contract benefits. The statistical distribution is designed to identify when the equity market return deviations from expected returns have become significant enough to warrant a change of the future equity return EGP assumption.  The stochastic modeling performed for our variable annuity blocks of business as described above is used to develop a range of reasonably possible future EGPs. We compare the range of the present value of the future EGPs from the stochastic modeling to that used in our amortization model. A set of intervals around the mean of these scenarios is utilized to calculate two separate statistical ranges of reasonably possible EGPs. These intervals are then compared again to the present value of the EGPs used in the amortization model. If the present value of EGP assumptions utilized for amortization were to exceed the margin of the reasonable range of statistically calculated EGPs, a revision of the EGPs used to calculate amortization would occur. If a revision is deemed necessary, future EGPs would be re-projected using the current account values at the end of the period during which the revision occurred along with a revised long-term annual equity market gross return assumption such that the reprojected EGPs would be our best estimate of EGPs.        69          Notwithstanding these intervals, if a severe decline or advance in equity markets were to occur or should other circumstances, including contract holder behavior, suggest that the present value of future EGPs no longer represents our best estimate, we could determine that a revision of the EGPs is necessary.  Our practice is not necessarily to unlock immediately after exceeding the first of the two statistical ranges, but, rather, if we stay between the first and second statistical range for several quarters, we would likely unlock. Additionally, if we exceed the ranges as a result of a short-term market reaction, we would not necessarily unlock. However, if the second statistical range is exceeded for more than one quarter, it is likely that we would unlock. While this approach reduces adjustments to DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL due to short-term equity market fluctuations, significant changes in the equity markets that extend beyond one or two quarters could result in a significant favorable or unfavorable unlocking.  Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets  Under the Intangibles – Goodwill and Other Topic of the FASB ASC, goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized, but are subject to impairment tests conducted at least annually. Intangibles that do not have indefinite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives. We are required to perform a two-step test in our evaluation of the carrying value of goodwill. In Step 1 of the evaluation, the fair value of each reporting unit is determined and compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit. If the fair value is greater than the carrying value, then the carrying value is deemed to be sufficient and Step 2 is not required. If the fair value estimate is less than the carrying value, it is an indicator that impairment may exist and Step 2 is required to be performed. In Step 2, the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill is determined by allocating the reporting unit’s fair value as determined in Step 1 to all of its net assets (recognized and unrecognized) as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination at the date of the impairment test. If the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill is lower than its carrying amount, goodwill is impaired and written down to its fair value. Refer to Note 8 of our consolidated financial statements for goodwill by reporting unit.  We use October 1 as the annual review date for goodwill and other intangible assets impairment testing. However, when factors indicate that an impairment could be present, we reassess our conclusions related to goodwill recoverability through completion of an interim test. Subsequent reviews of goodwill could result in impairment of goodwill. Due to volatile capital markets and their unfavorable impact to our liquidity, earnings and discount rate assumptions and the execution of a reinsurance transaction on our life business, we completed an interim test of goodwill impairment as of March 31, 2009.  We performed a Step 1 goodwill impairment analysis on all of our reporting units as of March 31, 2009. The Step 1 analysis for Insurance Solutions – Life and Retirement Solutions – Annuities reporting units utilized primarily a discounted cash flow valuation technique. In determining the estimated fair value of these reporting units, we incorporated consideration of discounted cash flow calculations, the level of our own share price and assumptions that market participants would make in valuing these reporting units. Our fair value estimations were based primarily on an in-depth analysis of projected future cash flows and relevant discount rates, which considered market participant inputs (“income approach”). The discounted cash flow analysis required us to make judgments about revenues, earnings projections, capital market assumptions and discount rates. The key assumptions used in the analysis to determine the fair value of these reporting units included:      ·   New business for 10 years and run off of cash flows on in-force and new business for the life of the reporting unit;        ·   Adjustments of several assumptions in our projections to reflect conservatism in the near-term as a result of the current volatility in the capital markets, including:            §   Lower equity market returns for 2 years;            §   Lower alternative investment income returns for 2 years;            §   Higher line of credit costs related to reserve securitizations;        ·   Discount rates ranging from 11.0% to 16.0%, which were based on the weighted average cost of capital for each of our reporting units adjusted for the risks associated with the operations. We used 11.0% for our Insurance Solutions – Life reporting unit and 16.0% for our Retirement Solutions – Annuities reporting unit.     For our other reporting units, we used other available information including market data obtained through strategic reviews and other analysis to support our Step 1 conclusions.  In the first quarter of 2009, all of our reporting units passed the Step 1 analysis, except for our Retirement Solutions – Annuities reporting unit, which required a Step 2 analysis to be completed. In our Step 2 analysis, we estimated the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill as determined by allocating the reporting unit’s fair value determined in Step 1 to all of its net assets (recognized and unrecognized) as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination at the date of the impairment test.       70          Based upon our Step 2 analysis, we recorded a goodwill impairment of $600 million for the Retirement Solutions – Annuities reporting unit in the first quarter of 2009, which was attributable primarily to higher discount rates related to higher debt costs and equity market volatility, deterioration in equity markets, which unfavorably impacted our account values and lower annuity sales.  There were no indicators of impairment as of September 30, 2009, due primarily to the continued improvement in the equity markets and lower discount rates during the second and third quarters of 2009. Media results are showing signs of weakness, and the associated intangibles will be reviewed for impairment during our fourth quarter testing process.  Investments  Investment Valuation  We use an internationally recognized pricing service as our primary pricing source, and we generally do not obtain multiple prices for our financial instruments. We generally use prices from the pricing service rather than broker quotes as we have documentation from the pricing service on the observable market inputs that they use to determine the prices in contrast to the broker quotes where we have limited information on the pricing inputs.  Our primary third party pricing service has policies and processes to ensure that they are using objectively verifiable observable market data. The pricing service regularly reviews the evaluation inputs for securities covered, including broker quotes, executed trades and credit information, as applicable. If the pricing service determines it does not have sufficient objectively verifiable information about a security’s valuation, they discontinue providing a valuation for the security. The pricing service regularly publishes and updates a summary of inputs used in their valuations by major security type. In addition, we have policies and procedures in place to review the process that is utilized by the third party pricing service and the output that is provided to ensure we are in agreement with the output provided by the pricing service. On a periodic basis, we test the pricing for a sample of securities to evaluate the inputs and assumptions used by the pricing service. In addition, we perform a check on prices provided by our primary pricing service to ensure that they are not stale or unreasonable by reviewing the prices for unusual changes from period to period based on certain parameters or for lack of change from one period to the next. If such anomalies in the pricing are observed, we verify the price provided by our pricing service with another pricing source.  As of September 30, 2009, we only obtained multiple prices for 106 available-for-sale and trading securities. These multiple prices were primarily related to instances where the vendor was providing a price for the first time and we also received a broker quote. In these instances, we used the price from the pricing service due to the higher reliability as discussed above.  For certain available-for-sale and trading securities, such as synthetic convertibles, index-linked certificates of deposit and collateralized debt obligations (“CDOs”), we obtain a broker quote when sufficient information, such as security structure or other market information, is not available to produce an evaluation. The brokers are asked to provide prices at which they believe they would trade the security; however, the inputs used by the brokers are unknown. Broker-quoted securities are adjusted based solely on receipt of updated quotes from market makers or broker-dealers recognized as market participants. Generally, the price for a security on this list is based on a quote from a single broker or market maker. As of September 30, 2009, we used broker quotes for 290 securities as our final price source.  For additional information, see “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Investments – Investment Valuation” in our 2008 Form 10-K.  Adoption of Updates to the Investments – Debt and Equity Securities Topic  We adopted updates to the Investments – Debt and Equity Securities Topic of the FASB ASC for our debt securities effective January 1, 2009. This adoption required that an OTTI loss be separated into the amount representing the decrease in cash flows expected to be collected (“credit loss”), which is recognized in earnings, and the amount related to all other factors (“noncredit loss”), which is recognized in other comprehensive income (“OCI”). In addition, the requirement for management to assert that it has the intent and ability to hold an impaired security until recovery was replaced with the requirement that management assert that it does not have the intent to sell the security and that it is more likely than not that it will not be required to sell the security before recovery of its cost basis.  We regularly review our AFS securities for declines in fair value that we determine to be other-than-temporary. If we intend to sell a security and the market value of the security is below amortized cost, the amortized cost is written down to current fair value with a corresponding charge to realized loss on our Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss), as this is deemed a credit-related event. If we do not intend to sell a security but believe we will not recover a security’s amortized cost, the amortized cost is written down to the estimated recovery value with a corresponding charge to realized loss on our Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss), as this is also deemed a credit-related event, and the remainder of the decline to fair value is recorded to OCI – unrealized OTTI on AFS securities on our Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Equity, as this is considered a noncredit (i.e., recoverable) event.       71          The determination of our intent to sell a security is based upon whether we can assert that we do not have the intent to sell the security and if it is more likely than not that we will not be required to sell the security before recovery of the security’s cost basis. In making this determination, we evaluate facts and circumstances such as, but not limited to, decisions to reposition our security portfolio, sales of securities to meet cash flow needs and sales of securities to capitalize on favorable pricing. The credit loss on a security is based upon our estimate of the decrease in expected cash flows or our best estimate of credit deterioration.  As a result of the adoption, we recorded a cumulative effect adjustment, resulting in an increase of $102 million to our opening balance of retained earnings with a corresponding decrease to accumulated OCI, to reclassify the noncredit portion of previously other-than-temporarily impaired debt securities. In addition, the amortized cost basis of debt securities for which a noncredit OTTI loss was previously recognized was increased by $199 million, or the amount of the cumulative effect adjustment, pre-DAC, VOBA, DSI, DFEL and tax. The fair value of our debt securities did not change as a result of the adoption.  We recognized an OTTI loss of $96 million and $376 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2009, of which $52 million and $207 million were recognized in net income on our Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss) related to credit losses and $44 million and $169 million were recognized in OCI on our Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Equity related to noncredit losses, respectively. For additional details, see “Investments” below and Notes 2 and 5.  Adoption of Updates to the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topic  We adopted updates to the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topic of the FASB ASC, effective January 1, 2009. The FASB provided additional guidance on estimating fair value when the volume and level of activity for an asset or liability have significantly decreased in relation to normal market activity for the asset or liability and additional guidance on circumstances that may indicate that a transaction is not orderly.  This guidance does not change the objective of a fair value measurement. That is, even when there has been a significant decrease in market activity for a security, the fair value objective remains the same. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell the security in an orderly transaction (i.e., not a forced liquidation or distressed sale), between market participants at the measurement date in the current inactive market (i.e., an “exit price” notion).  The FASB provided additional guidance on estimating fair value when the volume and level of activity for an asset or liability have significantly decreased in relation to normal market activity for the asset or liability. The FASB also provided additional guidance on circumstances that may indicate that a transaction is not orderly. Specifically, the guidance provided factors that indicate that a market is not active, including:      ·   Few recent transactions based on volume and level of activity in the market, therefore there is not sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis;        ·   Price quotations are not based on current information;        ·   Price quotations vary substantially either over time or among market makers;        ·   Indexes that previously were highly correlated with the fair values of the asset are demonstrably uncorrelated with recent fair values;        ·   Abnormal, or significant increases in, liquidity risk premiums or implied yields for quoted prices when compared with reasonable estimates using realistic assumptions of credit and other nonperformance risk for the asset class;        ·   Abnormally wide bid-ask spread or significant increases in the bid-ask spread; and        ·   Little information is released publicly.     After evaluating all factors and considering the significance and relevance of each factor, the reporting entity shall use its judgment in determining whether there has been a significant decrease in the volume and level of activity for the asset when the market for that asset is not active. The factors should be considered in relation to the normal market activity for the asset.  When the market for an asset or liability has exhibited a significant decrease in transaction volume when compared to normal market activity for the asset or liability (or similar assets and liabilities), additional analysis is required to ascertain whether or not observed transactions or quoted prices are reflective of fair values. When there has been a significant decline in activity and a market is no longer active, the use of multiple valuation techniques (or a change in valuation technique) may be appropriate. The circumstances that may indicate a transaction is not orderly could include:      ·   The seller is in or near bankruptcy or receivership or the seller was required to sell the asset to meet regulatory requirements;        ·   There was a usual and customary marketing period, but the seller marketed the asset to a single market participant; and        ·   The transaction price is significantly different relative to other similar transactions.          72          Transactions that are deemed not orderly would not be determinative of fair value or of market participant risk premiums. In estimating fair value, an entity should place more weight on transactions that it concludes are orderly. Less weight should be placed on transactions that the reporting entity does not have sufficient information to conclude whether the transaction is orderly. As of September 30, 2009, we evaluated the markets that our securities trade in and concluded that none were inactive. We will continue to re-evaluate this conclusion, as needed, based on market conditions.  Derivatives  We use derivative instruments to manage a variety of equity market and interest rate risks that are inherent in many of our life insurance and annuity products. Assessing the effectiveness of these hedging programs and evaluating the carrying values of the related derivatives often involve a variety of assumptions and estimates. We use derivatives to hedge equity market risks, interest rate risk and foreign currency exposures that are embedded in our annuity and life insurance product liabilities or investment portfolios. Derivatives held as of September 30, 2009, contain industry standard terms. Our accounting policies for derivatives and the potential impact on interest spreads in a falling rate environment are discussed in “Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” and Note 6 of this report and “Part II – Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” and Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2008 Form 10-K.  Guaranteed Living Benefits  We have a dynamic hedging strategy designed to mitigate selected risk and income statement volatility caused by changes in the equity markets, interest rates and market implied volatilities associated with the Lincoln SmartSecurity® Advantage guaranteed withdrawal benefit (“GWB”) feature and our i4LIFE® Advantage and 4LATER® Advantage guaranteed income benefit (“GIB”) features that are available in our variable annuity products. We have certain GLB variable annuity products with GWB and GIB features that are embedded derivatives. Certain features of these guarantees, notably our GIB and 4LATER® features, have elements of both insurance benefits accounted for under the Financial Services – Insurance – Claim Costs and Liabilities for Future Policy Benefits Subtopic of the FASB ASC (“benefit reserves”) and embedded derivative reserves. We calculate the value of the embedded derivative reserve and the benefit reserve based on the specific characteristics of each GLB feature. In addition to mitigating selected risk and income statement volatility, the hedge program is also focused on a long-term goal of accumulating assets that could be used to pay claims under these benefits, recognizing that such claims are likely to begin no earlier than approximately a decade in the future.  If we were to experience unfavorable capital markets as we did late in 2008, then we would expect greater liabilities associated with the contractual guarantees. However, the relationship between the components of the guarantees, namely, the embedded derivative reserves and the benefit reserves, is not linear. As the exposure to net amount at risk increases, the relative portion of the projected benefits that is accounted for as benefit reserves increases relative to the portion that is accounted for as embedded derivative reserves.  The hedging strategy is designed such that changes in the value of the hedge contracts move in the opposite direction of changes in GLB embedded derivative reserves. This dynamic hedging strategy utilizes options on U.S.-based equity indices, futures on U.S.-based and international equity indices and variance swaps on U.S.-based equity indices, as well as interest rate futures and swaps. The notional amounts of the underlying hedge instruments are such that the magnitude of the change in the value of the hedge instruments due to changes in equity markets, interest rates and implied volatilities is designed to offset the magnitude of the change in the fair value of the GLB guarantees caused by those same factors. As of September 30, 2009, the fair value of the embedded derivative reserve, before adjustment for the required NPR factors, for GWB, the i4LIFE® Advantage GIB and the 4LATER® Advantage GIB were valued at $631 million, $283 million and $100 million, respectively. See “Realized Loss – Operating Realized Gain (Loss) – GLB” for information on how we determine our NPR.  As part of our current hedging program, equity market, interest rate and market implied volatility conditions are monitored on a daily basis. We rebalance our hedge positions based upon changes in these factors as needed. While we actively manage our hedge positions, our hedge positions may not completely offset changes in the fair value embedded derivative reserve caused by movements in these factors due to, among other things, differences in timing between when a market exposure changes and corresponding changes to the hedge positions, extreme swings in the equity markets, interest rates and market implied volatilities, realized market volatility, contract holder behavior, divergence between the performance of the underlying funds and the hedging indices, divergence between the actual and expected performance of the hedge instruments or our ability to purchase hedging instruments at prices consistent with our desired risk and return trade-off. This hedging strategy is managed on a combined basis with the hedge for our GDB features.  For more information on our GDB hedging strategy, see “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Future Contract Benefits and Other Contract Holder Obligations – Guaranteed Death Benefits” in our 2008 Form 10-K.       73          As of September 30, 2009, the fair value of our derivative assets, which hedge both our GLB and GDB features, and including margins generated by futures contracts, was $1.2 billion. As of September 30, 2009, the sum of all GLB liabilities at fair value, excluding the NPR adjustment, and GDB reserves was $1.1 billion, comprised of $1.0 billion for GLB liabilities and $0.1 billion for the GDB reserves. The fair value of the hedge assets exceeded the liabilities by $0.1 billion, which we believe indicates that the hedge strategy has performed well by providing funding for our best estimate of the present value of the liabilities related to our GLB and GDB features. However, the relationship of hedge assets to the liabilities for the guarantees may vary in any given reporting period due to market conditions, hedge performance and/or changes to the hedging strategy.  Approximately 38% of our variable annuity account values contain a GWB rider as of September 30, 2009. Declines in the equity markets increase our exposure to potential benefits under the GWB contracts, leading to an increase in our existing liability for those benefits. For example, a GWB contract is “in the money” if the contract holder’s account balance falls below the guaranteed amount. As of September 30, 2009, and September 30, 2008, 59% and 79%, respectively, of all GWB in-force contracts were “in the money,” and our exposure to the guaranteed amounts, after reinsurance, as of September 30, 2009, and September 30, 2008, was $2.5 billion. Our exposure before reinsurance for these same periods was $2.8 billion and $2.9 billion, respectively. However, the only way the GWB contract holder can monetize the excess of the guaranteed amount over the account value of the contract is upon death or through a series of withdrawals that do not exceed a specific percentage per year of the guaranteed amount. If, after the series of withdrawals, the account value is exhausted, the contract holder will receive a series of annuity payments equal to the remaining guaranteed amount, and, for our lifetime GWB products, the annuity payments can continue beyond the guaranteed amount. The account value can also fluctuate with equity market returns on a daily basis resulting in increases or decreases in the excess of the guaranteed amount over account value.  As a result of these factors, the ultimate amount to be paid by us related to GWB guarantees is uncertain and could be significantly more or less than $2.5 billion, net of reinsurance. Our fair value estimates of the GWB liabilities, which are based on detailed models of future cash flows under a wide range of market-consistent scenarios, reflect a more comprehensive view of the related factors and represent our best estimate of the present value of these potential liabilities. The market-consistent scenarios used in the determination of the fair value of the GWB liabilities are similar to those used by an investment bank to value derivatives for which the pricing is not transparent and the aftermarket is nonexistent or illiquid. In our calculation, risk-neutral Monte Carlo simulations resulting in over 10 million scenarios are utilized to value the entire block of guarantees. The market-consistent scenario assumptions, at each valuation date, are those we view to be appropriate for a hypothetical market participant. The market consistent inputs include assumptions for the capital markets (e.g., implied volatilities, correlation among indices, risk-free swap curve, etc.), policyholder behavior (e.g., policy lapse, benefit utilization, mortality, etc.), risk margins, administrative expenses and a margin for profit. We believe these assumptions are consistent with those that would be used by a market participant; however, as the related markets develop, we will continue to reassess our assumptions. It is possible that different valuation techniques and assumptions could produce a materially different estimate of fair value.  For information on our GLB hedging results, see our discussion in “Realized Loss” below.  Income Taxes  The application of GAAP requires us to evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax assets and establish a valuation allowance, if necessary, to reduce our deferred tax asset to an amount that is more likely than not to be realizable. Considerable judgment and the use of estimates are required in determining whether a valuation allowance is necessary, and if so, the amount of such valuation allowance. In evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, we consider many factors, including: the nature and character of the deferred tax assets and liabilities; taxable income in prior carryback years; future reversals of existing temporary differences; the length of time carryovers can be utilized; and any tax planning strategies we would employ to avoid a tax benefit from expiring unused. Although realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets, including our capital loss deferred tax asset, will be realized. For additional information on our income taxes, see Note 7 in this report and Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2008 Form 10-K.       74          Acquisitions and Dispositions  As of August 18, 2009, LNC and its wholly owned subsidiary, Lincoln National Investment Companies, entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement with Macquarie Bank Limited (“MBL”), pursuant to which we agreed to sell to MBL all of the outstanding capital stock of Delaware Management Holdings, Inc., our subsidiary, or “Delaware,” which provides investment products and services to individuals and institutions. We expect this transaction to close on or around December 31, 2009. At closing, we will receive $320 million in addition to the value of net assets (excluding goodwill and as otherwise defined in the Purchase and Sale Agreement) of Delaware and its subsidiaries as estimated at closing. In addition, a revenue run-rate adjustment mechanism will be applied in the event that the closing revenue run-rate of Delaware is less than 90% of its revenue run-rate on April 30, 2009 (the “Base Revenue Run-Rate”), provided that the reduction in the purchase price shall not exceed 15%. In the event that the closing revenue run-rate of Delaware is less than 75% of the Base Revenue Run-Rate, the buyer may exercise the option to terminate the transaction. The revenue run-rates will be calculated in a manner that excludes the impact of any distributions of interest, dividends, income or capital gains from any client account and any increase or decrease in assets under management due to changes in the markets and/or currency fluctuations. Based on the foregoing, we currently expect to receive cash consideration at closing of approximately $430 million; however, this number may differ based on the adjustments set forth above.  The closing purchase price is also subject to other post-closing adjustments, including an adjustment based on the final closing balance sheet (as determined under the Purchase and Sale Agreement). In addition, certain of our subsidiaries, including The Lincoln National Life Insurance Company (“LNL”), our primary insurance subsidiary, will enter into investment advisory agreements with Delaware, pursuant to which Delaware will continue to manage the majority of the general account insurance assets of the subsidiaries. The investment advisory agreements will have ten-year terms, and we may terminate them without cause by paying an aggregate termination fee of up to $84 million in the event that all of the agreements with our subsidiaries are terminated that will decline on a pro rata basis over the ten-year term of the advisory agreements.  MBL and we have each made customary representations, warranties and covenants, as applicable, in the Purchase and Sale Agreement. The Purchase and Sale Agreement also contains customary indemnifications, including our indemnifying MBL with respect to the Transamerica litigation, which is described in Note 11. The completion of the transaction contemplated by the Purchase and Sale Agreement is subject to regulatory approvals and the satisfaction of other customary conditions, some of which are beyond our control, and no assurance can be given that such completion will occur.  The transaction is expected to be neutral to earnings per share assuming reinvestment of net proceeds back into core insurance businesses. We expect a modest gain on disposal, which will be recorded as of the close of the transaction. The actual gain or loss may differ from our expected result depending upon, among other things, the actual purchase price after closing adjustments.  This summary of the material terms and provisions of the Purchase and Sale Agreement is subject in its entirety to the Purchase and Sale Agreement attached hereto as Exhibit 2.1 and incorporated herein by reference.  On October 1, 2009, we completed the previously announced sale of the capital stock of Lincoln National (UK) plc to SLF of Canada UK Limited for proceeds of approximately $305 million, after-tax, subject to customary post-closing adjustments. We retained Lincoln UK’s pension plan assets and liabilities. The results of Lincoln National (UK) plc and its subsidiaries comprised the former Lincoln UK segment. The Lincoln UK segment primarily focused on providing life and retirement income products in the U.K. In the third quarter of 2009, there was a $55 million adjustment to the loss on disposition of our Lincoln UK segment as a result of finalizing treatment of the UK pension, refining certain tax estimates and closing out various hedges put in place at the time of the announcement.  Accordingly, we have reported the results of these businesses as discontinued operations on our Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss) and the assets and liabilities as held for sale on our Consolidated Balance Sheets for all periods presented. See Note 3 for additional details.  For additional information about acquisitions and divestitures, see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2008 Form 10-K.       75                  RESULTS OF CONSOLIDATED OPERATIONS     Net Income  Details underlying the consolidated results, deposits, net flows and account values (in millions) were as follows:           For the Three             For the Nine                Months Ended             Months Ended                September 30,             September 30,                2009       2008       Change       2009       2008       Change      Revenues                                        Insurance premiums    $ 491     $ 514       -4 %   $ 1,541     $ 1,507       2 %   Insurance fees      766       754       2 %     2,158       2,314       -7 %   Net investment income      1,071       1,068       0 %     3,055       3,170       -4 %   Realized loss:                                                    Total OTTI losses on securities      (148 )     (237 )     38 %     (578 )     (395 )     -46 %   Portion of loss recognized in OCI      68       -

Comparison of the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2009 to 2008  Net income decreased due primarily to the following:      ·   Impairment of goodwill in the first quarter of 2009 of $600 million for Retirement Solutions – Individual Annuities due to continued market volatility, the corresponding increase in discount rates and lower annuity sales compared to $139 million of impairment of goodwill and our Federal Communications Commission license intangible assets on our remaining radio clusters in the second quarter of 2008 attributable to declines in advertising revenues for the entire radio market (see “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” above for additional information on our goodwill impairment); however, these non-cash impairments did not impact our liquidity and will not impact our future liquidity;        ·   The overall unfavorable GLB net derivatives results, excluding unlocking, in the first nine months of 2009, which was due to a reduction in the NPR component of the liability that is not included in the hedge program attributable to a narrowing of credit spreads, compared to favorable GLB net derivatives results in the first nine months of 2008 as the NPR adjustment was favorable attributable primarily to widening credit spreads that more than offset the unfavorable GLB hedge program performance due to extreme market conditions (see “Realized Loss” below for more information on our GLB liability and derivative performance);        ·   The $115 million loss on disposition of our Lincoln UK segment during 2009 (see “Acquisitions and Dispositions” above and Note 3 for additional information on the disposition of our discontinued operations);        ·   Lower earnings from our variable annuity and mutual fund products as a result of declines in the equity markets;        ·   Lower net investment income attributable primarily to less favorable investment income on surplus and alternative investments due primarily to a deterioration of the capital markets (see “Consolidated Investments – Alternative Investments” below for additional information on our alternative investments) as well as holding higher cash balances related to our short-term liquidity strategy during the recent volatile markets that has reduced our portfolio yield;        ·   The $64 million unfavorable impact from the rescission of the reinsurance agreement on certain disability income business sold to Swiss Re in the first quarter of 2009, as discussed in “Reinsurance” below;        ·   Higher DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL amortization, net of interest and excluding unlocking, due primarily to the reduction in EGPs (see “Retirement Solutions – Annuities – Additional Segment Information” below for more information);        ·   Higher benefits due primarily to an increase in the growth in benefit reserves from higher expected GDB benefit payments; and        ·   The impact of prospective unlocking discussed above.          79          The decrease in net income was partially offset by the following:      ·   A $42 million gain in the first quarter of 2009 associated with the early extinguishment of long-term debt;        ·   A reduction in federal income tax expense due primarily to favorable tax return true-ups driven by the separate account DRD, foreign tax credit adjustments and other items;        ·   Lower broker-dealer expenses due primarily to lower sales of non-proprietary products, lower interest and debt expenses as a result of a decline in interest rates and average balances of outstanding debt in 2009, lower merger expenses as many of our integration efforts related to our acquisition of Jefferson-Pilot have been completed and the implementation of several expense initiatives, partially offset by restructuring charges related to many of these initiatives and higher incentive compensation accruals as a result of higher earnings and production performance relative to planned goals;        ·   A $97 million unfavorable retrospective unlocking of DAC, VOBA, DSI, DFEL and the reserves for annuity and life insurance products with living benefit and death benefit guarantees during the first nine months of 2009 due primarily to the overall performance of our GLB derivative program (see “Realized Loss” below for more information on our GLB derivative performance), partially offset by lower lapses and higher equity market performance than our model projections assumed, compared to a $118 million unfavorable retrospective unlocking during the first nine months of 2008 due primarily to the impact of lower equity market performance and premiums received, higher death claims and future GDB claims than our model projections assumed and model adjustments on certain life insurance policies;        ·   A decrease in realized losses on our AFS securities attributable primarily to lower OTTI; and        ·   The $16 million impact of the initial adoption of the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topic of the FASB ASC on January 1, 2008.     The foregoing items are discussed in further detail in results of operations by segment discussions and “Realized Loss” below. In addition, for a discussion of the earnings impact of the equity markets, see “Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – Equity Market Risk – Impact of Equity Market Sensitivity.”       80          RESULTS OF RETIREMENT SOLUTIONS  The Retirement Solutions business provides its products through two segments: Annuities and Defined Contribution. The Retirement Solutions – Annuities segment provides tax-deferred investment growth and lifetime income opportunities for its clients by offering individual fixed annuities, including indexed annuities, and variable annuities. The Retirement Solutions – Defined Contribution segment provides employer-sponsored variable and fixed annuities and mutual-fund based programs in the 401(k), 403(b) and 457 marketplaces.  Retirement Solutions – Annuities  Income from Operations  Details underlying the results for Retirement Solutions – Annuities (in millions) were as follows:           For the Three             For the Nine                Months Ended             Months Ended                September 30,             September 30,                2009       2008       Change       2009       2008       Change      Operating Revenues                                        Insurance premiums (1)    $ 17     $ 52       -67 %   $ 77     $ 103       -25 %   Insurance fees      223       246       -9 %     598       749       -20 %   Net investment income      271       243       12 %     756       736       3 %   Operating realized gain (loss) (2)      (61 )     52      NM        (73 )     74      NM      Other revenues and fees (3)      73       82       -11 %     201       254       -21 %   Total operating revenues      523       675       -23 %     1,559       1,916       -19 %   Operating Expenses                                                    Interest credited      185       170       9 %     511       496       3 %   Benefits (2)      (43 )     112      NM        69       199       -65 %   Underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other                                                     expenses      268       254       6 %     728       774       -6 %   Total operating expenses      410       536       -24 %     1,308       1,469       -11 %   Income from operations before taxes      113       139       -19 %     251       447       -44 %   Federal income tax expense      18       8       125 %     17       82       -79 %   Income from operations    $ 95     $ 131       -27 %   $ 234     $ 365       -36 %         (1)   Insurance premiums includes primarily our single premium immediate annuities, which have a corresponding offset in benefits for changes in reserves.        (2)   The change in benefit ratio reserves for this segment was $(76) million and $(101) million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2009, respectively, driven by variable account growth, as compared to $50 million and $65 million in the corresponding periods of 2008; however, this impact is offset within operating realized gain (loss) as discussed below.        (3)   Other revenues and fees consists primarily of broker-dealer earnings that are subject to market volatility.     Comparison of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2009 to 2008  Income from operations for this segment decreased due primarily to the following:      ·   Lower insurance fees driven primarily by lower average daily variable account values due to unfavorable equity markets;        ·   A reduction in federal income tax expense in the third quarter of 2008 due primarily to favorable tax return true-ups driven by the separate account DRD and other items;        ·   Higher underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses, excluding amortization of DAC and VOBA, due primarily to higher account-value-based trail commissions driven by positive net flows that more than offset the impact of unfavorable equity markets since the third quarter of 2008, higher incentive compensation accruals as a result of higher earnings and production performance relative to planned goals and higher expenses attributable to our U.S. pension plans (see discussion in “Additional Segment Information” below);          81                   ·    Higher benefits, excluding the change in benefit ratio reserves in operating realized gain (loss), due primarily to an increase in the growth in benefit reserves from higher expected  GDB benefit payments;          ·   A $6 million unfavorable prospective unlocking from assumption changes of DAC, VOBA, DSI, DFEL and reserves for our guarantee riders in 2009 due primarily to higher maintenance expenses partially offset by higher expense assessments than our model projections assumed compared to none in 2008 (see “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL” for more information);        ·   Higher DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL amortization, net of interest and excluding unlocking, due primarily to the reduction in EGPs discussed in “Additional Segment Information” below; and        ·   A less favorable net broker-dealer margin attributable primarily to lower sales of non-proprietary products, lower earnings due to lower production levels and higher legal accruals.        The decrease in income from operations was partially offset by the following:      ·   A $16 million favorable retrospective unlocking of DAC, VOBA, DSI, DFEL and reserves for our guarantee riders during the third quarter of 2009 due primarily to lower lapses and the impact of higher equity market performance than our model projections assumed, compared to a $9 million unfavorable retrospective unlocking during the third quarter of 2008 due primarily to lower equity market performance than our model projections assumed; and        ·   Higher net investment income, partially offset by higher interest credited, driven primarily by higher average fixed account values, including the fixed portion of variable annuity contracts, attributable primarily to positive net flows and an increase in investment income on surplus investments due primarily to more favorable investment income on alternative investments, partially offset by our liquidity strategy of maintaining higher cash balances during the recent volatile markets that remained present early in the third quarter of 2009 that has reduced our portfolio yield by 3 basis points for the third quarter of 2009.     Comparison of the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2009 to 2008  Income from operations for this segment decreased due primarily to the following:      ·   Lower insurance fees driven primarily by lower average daily variable account values due to unfavorable equity markets;        ·   Higher benefits, excluding the change in benefit ratio reserves in operating realized gain (loss), due primarily to an increase in the growth in benefit reserves from higher expected GDB benefit payments;        ·   A less favorable net broker-dealer margin attributable primarily to lower sales of non-proprietary products;        ·   The impact of the prospective unlocking discussed above;        ·   Higher underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses, excluding amortization of DAC and VOBA, due primarily to higher account-value-based trail commissions driven by positive net flows since the third quarter of 2008, partially offset by the impact of unfavorable equity markets on account values, higher incentive compensation accruals as a result of higher earnings and production performance relative to planned goals and higher expenses attributable to our U.S. pension plans (see discussion in “Additional Segment Information” below); and        ·   Higher DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL amortization, net of interest and excluding unlocking, due primarily to the reduction in EGPs discussed in “Additional Segment Information” below.     The decrease in income from operations was partially offset by the following:      ·   A reduction in federal income tax expense due primarily to the decrease in earnings and favorable tax return true-ups driven by the separate account DRD, foreign tax credit adjustments and other items in the first nine months of 2009;        ·   A $14 million favorable retrospective unlocking of DAC, VOBA, DSI, DFEL and reserves for our guarantee riders during the first nine months of 2009 due primarily to lower lapses and higher equity market performance than our model projections assumed, compared to a $6 million unfavorable retrospective unlocking during the first nine months of 2008 due primarily to lower equity market performance than our model projections assumed; and        ·   Higher net investment income, partially offset by higher interest credited, driven primarily by higher average fixed account values, including the fixed portion of variable annuity contracts, attributable primarily to positive net flows and by actions implemented since the third quarter of 2008 to reduce interest crediting rates, partially offset by our liquidity strategy of maintaining higher cash balances during the recent volatile markets that has reduced our portfolio yield by 25 basis points for the first nine months of 2009, a decline in investment income on surplus investments due primarily to less favorable investment income on alternative investments (see “Consolidated Investments – Alternative Investments” below for additional information).          82          Additional Segment Information  Prior to the second quarter of 2009, the equity markets unfavorably impacted our average variable account values and the resulting fees earned on these accounts. Additionally, weaker credit fundamentals negatively impacted our investment margins and increased our realized losses on investments, including OTTI. As a result, we lowered the projected EGPs for this segment, which will result in higher DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL amortization and lower earnings for this segment.  We experienced higher expenses attributable to our U.S. pension plans (see “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans” in our 2008 Form 10-K) during the first nine months of 2009, and the fourth quarter of 2009 will continue this unfavorable trend when compared to the corresponding period in 2008.  Although the segment’s results during the first nine months of 2009 were unfavorably impacted by lower average account values and the economic environment, its overall net flows were strong in a challenging economic environment and our end of period account values were higher. New deposits are an important component of net flows and key to our efforts to grow our business. Although deposits do not significantly impact current period income from operations, they are an important indicator of future profitability.  The other component of net flows relates to the retention of the business. An important measure of retention is the lapse rate, which compares the amount of withdrawals to the average account values. The overall lapse rates for our annuity products were 7% and 9% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2009, compared to 9% and 8% for the corresponding periods in 2008.  See Note 9 above for information on contractual guarantees to contract holders related to GDB features for our Retirement Solutions business.  We expect to manage the effect of changing market investment returns by managing interest rate spreads for near-term income from operations through a combination of crediting rate actions and portfolio management. Our expectation includes the assumption that there are no significant changes in net flows in or out of our fixed accounts or other changes that may cause interest rate spreads to differ from our expectation.  Our fixed annuity business includes products with crediting rates that are reset on an annual basis and are not subject to surrender charges. Account values for these products, including the fixed portion of variable, were $7.1 billion as of September 30, 2009, with 68% already at their minimum guaranteed rates. The average crediting rates for these products were approximately 37 basis points in excess of average minimum guaranteed rates. Our ability to retain annual reset annuities will be subject to current competitive conditions at the time interest rates for these products reset. For information on interest rate spreads and the interest rate risk due to falling interest rates, see “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – Interest Rate Risk on Fixed Insurance Business – Falling Rates” in our 2008 Form 10-K.  For factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in this section, see “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2008 Form 10-K and “Forward-Looking Statements – Cautionary Language” in this report.  We provide information about this segment’s operating revenue and operating expense line items, the period in which amounts are recognized, key drivers of changes and historical details underlying the line items and their associated drivers below.

These assessments are a function of the rates priced into the product and the average daily variable account values. Average daily account values are driven by net flows and the equity markets. In addition, for our fixed annuity contracts and for some variable contracts, we collect surrender charges when contract holders surrender their contracts during their surrender charge periods to protect us from premature withdrawals. Insurance fees include charges on both our variable and fixed annuity products, but exclude the attributed fees on our GLB products; see “Realized Loss – Operating Realized Gain (Loss) – GLB” below for discussion of these attributed fees.       85          Net Investment Income and Interest Credited  Details underlying net investment income, interest credited (in millions) and our interest rate spread were as follows:           For the Three             For the Nine                Months Ended             Months Ended                September 30,             September 30,                2009       2008       Change       2009       2008       Change      Net Investment Income                                        Fixed maturity securities, mortgage loans on real                                        estate and other, net of investment expenses    $ 248     $ 222       12 %   $ 707     $ 675       5 %   Commercial mortgage loan prepayment and bond                                                    makewhole premiums (1)      1       1       0 %     1       2       -50 %   Alternative investments (2)      -       -      NM        -       (1 )     100 %   Surplus investments (3)      22       19       16 %     48       57       -16 %   Broker-dealer      -       1       -100 %     -       3       -100 %   Total net investment income    $ 271     $ 243       12 %   $ 756     $ 736       3 %                                                      Interest Credited                                                    Amount provided to contract holders    $ 205     $ 187       10 %   $ 541     $ 550       -2 %   Adjustment (4)      (8 )     -      NM        -       -      NM      DSI deferrals      (20 )     (25 )     20 %     (54 )     (76 )     29 %   Interest credited before DSI amortization      177       162       9 %     487       474       3 %   DSI amortization:                                                    Retrospective unlocking      (7 )     3      NM        (8 )     2      NM      Amortization, excluding unlocking      15       5       200 %     32       20       60 %   Total interest credited    $ 185     $ 170       9 %   $ 511     $ 496       3 %         (1)   See “Consolidated Investments – Commercial Mortgage Loan Prepayment and Bond Makewhole Premiums” below for additional information.

We expect to earn a spread between what we earn on the underlying general account investments supporting the fixed annuity product line, including the fixed portion of variable annuity contracts, and what we credit to our fixed annuity contract holders’ accounts, including the fixed portion of variable annuity contracts. The interest rate spread for this segment represents the excess of the yield on invested assets on reserves over the average crediting rate. The yield on invested assets on reserves is calculated as net investment income, excluding the amounts attributable to our surplus investments, reverse repurchase agreement interest expense, inter-segment cash management program interest expense and interest on collateral divided by average invested assets on reserves. The average invested assets on reserves is calculated based upon total invested assets, excluding hedge derivatives and collateral. The average crediting rate is calculated as interest credited before DSI amortization, plus the immediate annuity reserve change (included within benefits) divided by the average fixed account values, including the fixed portion of variable annuity contracts, net of coinsured account values. Fixed account values reinsured under modified coinsurance agreements are included in account values for this calculation. Changes in commercial mortgage loan prepayments and bond makewhole premiums, investment income on alternative investments and surplus investment income can vary significantly from period to period due to a number of factors and, therefore, may contribute to investment income results that are not indicative of the underlying trends.  Benefits  Benefits for this segment include changes in reserves of immediate annuity account values driven by premiums and changes in GDB and GLB benefit reserves.       87          The changes in the GDB benefit ratio reserves for this segment are offset in operating realized gain (loss).

Comparison of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2009 to 2008  Income from operations for this segment modestly increased due primarily to the following:      ·   Higher net investment income driven primarily by higher average fixed account values, including the fixed portion of variable annuity contracts, driven by transfers from variable to fixed since the third quarter of 2008, partially offset by our liquidity strategy of maintaining higher cash balances during the recent volatile markets that remained present early in the third quarter of 2009 that has reduced our portfolio yield by 11 basis points for the third quarter of 2009;        ·   A $5 million favorable prospective unlocking from assumption changes of DAC, VOBA, DSI and reserves for our guarantee riders in 2009 due primarily to a compensation-related change in our wholesaling distribution organization that lowered deferrals as a percentage of total expenses incurred and lower maintenance expenses than our model projections assumed (see “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL” for more information); and        ·   A $2 million unfavorable retrospective unlocking of DAC, VOBA, DSI and reserves for our guarantee riders during the third quarter of 2008 due primarily to lower equity market performance and higher lapses than our model projections assumed.     The increase in income from operations was partially offset by the following:      ·   Lower insurance fees driven primarily by lower average daily variable account values resulting from the unfavorable equity markets and an overall shift in business mix toward products with lower expense assessment rates;        ·   Higher interest credited driven primarily by higher average fixed account values, including the fixed portion of variable annuity contracts, driven by transfers from variable to fixed since the third quarter of 2008, partially offset by actions implemented during the third quarter of 2009 to reduce interest crediting rates; and        ·   Higher underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses, excluding unlocking, due primarily to higher incentive compensation accruals as a result of higher earnings and production performance relative to planned goals.          89          Comparison of the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2009 to 2008  Income from operations for this segment decreased due primarily to the following:      ·   Lower insurance fees driven primarily by lower average daily variable account values resulting from the unfavorable equity markets and an overall shift in business mix toward products with lower expense assessment rates; and        ·   Higher interest credited driven primarily by higher average fixed account values, including the fixed portion of variable annuity contracts, driven by transfers from variable to fixed since the third quarter of 2008, partially offset by actions implemented during the third quarter of 2009 to reduce interest crediting rates.     The decrease in income from operations was partially offset by the following:      ·   Higher net investment income driven primarily by higher average fixed account values, including the fixed portion of variable annuity contracts, driven by transfers from variable to fixed since the third quarter of 2008, partially offset by our liquidity strategy of maintaining higher cash balances during the recent volatile markets that has reduced our portfolio yield by 15 basis points and a decline in investment income on surplus investments due primarily to less favorable investment income on alternative investments (see “Consolidated Investments – Alternative Investments” below for additional information);        ·   The impact of the prospective unlocking discussed above; and        ·   A $1 million unfavorable retrospective unlocking of DAC, VOBA, DSI and reserves for our guarantee riders during the first nine months of 2009 due primarily to higher lapses and maintenance expenses and lower equity market performance than our model projections assumed, compared to a $3 million unfavorable retrospective unlocking during the first nine months of 2008 due primarily to lower equity market performance and higher lapses than our model projections assumed.     Additional Segment Information  We experienced higher expenses attributable to our U.S. pension plans (see “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans” in our 2008 Form 10-K) during the first nine months of 2009, and the fourth quarter of 2009 will continue this unfavorable trend when compared to the corresponding period in 2008.  New deposits are an important component of net flows and key to our efforts to grow our business. Although deposits do not significantly impact current period income from operations, they are an important indicator of future profitability.  The other component of net flows relates to the retention of the business. An important measure of retention is the lapse rate, which compares the amount of withdrawals to the average account values. The overall lapse rates for our annuity products were 12% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2009, compared to 14% and 15% for the corresponding periods in 2008.  Due to an expected overall shift in business mix towards products with lower expense assessment rates, a substantial increase in new deposit production will be necessary to maintain earnings at current levels.  See Note 9 above for information on contractual guarantees to contract holders related to GDB features for our Retirement Solutions Business.  We expect to manage the effect of changing market investment returns by managing interest rate spreads for near-term income from operations through a combination of crediting rate actions and portfolio management. Our expectation includes the assumption that there are no significant changes in net flows in or out of our fixed accounts or other changes that may cause interest rate spreads to differ from our expectation. For information on interest rate spreads and the interest rate risk due to falling interest rates, see “Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.”  For factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in this section, see “Part I – Item 1A.

We expect to earn a spread between what we earn on the underlying general account investments supporting the fixed annuity product line, including the fixed portion of variable annuity contracts, and what we credit to our fixed annuity contract holders’ accounts, including the fixed portion of variable annuity contracts. The interest rate spread for this segment represents the excess of the yield on invested assets on reserves over the average crediting rate. The yield on invested assets on reserves is calculated as net investment income, excluding the amounts attributable to our surplus investments, reverse repurchase agreement interest expense, inter-segment cash management program interest expense and interest on collateral, divided by average invested assets on reserves. The average invested assets on reserves are calculated based upon total invested assets, excluding hedge derivatives. The average crediting rate is calculated as interest credited before DSI amortization, divided by the average fixed account values, including the fixed portion of variable annuity contracts. Commercial mortgage loan prepayments and bond makewhole premiums, investment income on alternative investments and surplus investment income can vary significantly from period to period due to a number of factors and, therefore, may contribute to investment income results that are not indicative of the underlying trends.  Benefits  Benefits for this segment include changes in GDB and GLB benefit reserves.  The changes in the GDB benefit ratio reserves for this segment are offset in operating realized loss.

We do not pay commissions on sales of our mutual fund products, and distribution expenses associated with the sale of these mutual fund products are expensed as they are incurred.       96          RESULTS OF INSURANCE SOLUTIONS  The Insurance Solutions business provides its products through two segments: Life Insurance and Group Protection. The Insurance Solutions – Life Insurance segment offers wealth protection and transfer opportunities through term insurance, a linked-benefit product (which is a UL policy linked with riders that provide for long-term care costs) and both single and survivorship versions of UL and VUL, including corporate-owned UL and VUL (“COLI”) and bank-owned UL and VUL (“BOLI”) products. The Insurance Solutions – Group Protection segment offers group life, disability and dental insurance to employers.

Risk Factors” in our 2008 Form 10-K and “Forward-Looking Statements – Cautionary Language” in this report.

The decrease in income from operations was partially offset by the following:      ·   The impact of prospective unlocking discussed above;        ·   Lower underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses, excluding unlocking, due primarily to a decrease in DAC and VOBA amortization as a result of lower gross margins in the first and second quarters of 2009, attributable primarily to lower investment income on alternative investments; and        ·   A reduction in federal income tax expense due primarily to favorable tax return true-ups in the first quarter of 2009.     Additional Segment Information  The coinsurance agreement that we entered into on March 31, 2009, resulted in a pre-tax deferred loss of $53 million, and approximately $2 million annually will be amortized into income from operations prospectively over 20 years. Effective October 1, 2009, we executed an additional agreement whereby we assumed the mortality risk on this block of business through yearly renewable term reinsurance. As a result of these agreements, this segment’s income from operations will be reduced by approximately $6 million per quarter as a result of reductions in insurance fees, net investment income, interest credited and benefits that we had not experienced prior to these agreements. This unfavorable impact will be partially offset by an approximate $2 million increase to income from operations in Other Operations, as a result of having higher net investment income due to the transfer of assets from Insurance Solutions – Life Insurance attributable to its reduction in capital as a result of these coinsurance agreements; therefore, we expect our net impact from this transaction to our consolidated net income will be a reduction of $4 million per quarter. See “Reinsurance” below for more information.  As of December 31, 2008, we released approximately $240 million of capital that had previously supported our UL products with secondary guarantees as a result of executing on a reinsurance transaction that resulted in the release of statutory reserves related to the Application of the Valuation of Life Insurance Policies Model Regulation (“AG38”). This reduction in capital lowered the level of assets supporting this business, as assets were transferred to Other Operations, and caused an approximate $4 million per quarter ongoing reduction in this segment’s net investment income.  A portion of the retrospective and prospective unlocking of DAC, VOBA, DFEL and secondary guarantee life insurance product reserves in 2008 resulted in an unfavorable recurring earnings impact of $7 million per quarter that began in the third quarter of 2008.  On March 1, 2009, we implemented a 15 basis point decrease in crediting rates on most interest-sensitive products not already at contractual guarantees, which has increased spreads by approximately 5 basis points. On June 1, 2008, we implemented a 10 basis point decrease in crediting rates on most interest-sensitive products not already at contractual guarantees, which has increased spreads by approximately 5 basis points.   As of September 30, 2009, 73% of interest-sensitive account values had crediting rates at contract guaranteed levels, and 14% had crediting rates within 50 basis points of contractual guarantees. Going forward, we expect to be able to manage the effects of spreads on near-term income from operations through a combination of rate actions and portfolio management, which assumes no significant changes in net flows into or out of our fixed accounts or other changes that may cause interest rate spreads to differ from our expectations. For information on interest rate spreads and the interest rate risk due to falling interest rates, see “Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.”  Sales are not recorded as a component of revenues (other than for traditional products) and do not have a significant impact on current quarter income from operations but are indicators of future profitability. Generally, we have higher sales during the second half of the year with the fourth quarter being our strongest; however, results for 2008 were muted given the economic conditions.       98          We experienced higher expenses attributable to our U.S. pension plans (see “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans” in our 2008 Form 10-K) during the first nine months of 2009, and the fourth quarter of 2009 will continue this unfavorable trend when compared to the corresponding period in 2008.  We provide information about this segment’s operating revenue and operating expense line items, the period in which amounts are recognized, key drivers of changes and historical details underlying the line items and their associated drivers below.  Insurance Premiums  Insurance premiums relate to traditional products and are a function of the rates priced into the product and the level of insurance in force. Insurance in force, in turn, is driven by sales, persistency and mortality experience.  Insurance Fees  Details underlying insurance fees, sales, net flows, account values and in-force face amount (in millions) were as follows:           For the Three             For the Nine                Months Ended             Months Ended                September 30,             September 30,                2009       2008       Change       2009       2008       Change      Insurance Fees                                        Mortality assessments    $ 317     $ 332       -5 %   $ 981     $ 982       0 %   Expense assessments      186       178       4 %     538       520       3 %   Surrender charges      33       18       83 %     81       52       56 %   DFEL:                                                    Deferrals      (108 )     (97 )     -11 %     (305 )     (276 )     -11 %   Amortization, net of interest:                                                    Prospective unlocking - assumption changes      20       (4 )    NM        20       (4 )    NM      Prospective unlocking - model refinements      -       (25 )     100 %     -       (25 )     100 %   Retrospective unlocking      8       12       -33 %     12       27       -56 %   Amortization, net of interest, excluding                                                    unlocking      38       37       3 %     99       110       -10 %   Total insurance fees    $ 494     $ 451       10 %   $ 1,426     $ 1,386       3 %             For the Three             For the Nine                Months Ended             Months Ended                September 30,             September 30,                2009       2008       Change       2009       2008       Change      Sales by Product                                        UL:                                        Excluding MoneyGuard®    $ 91     $ 144       -37 %   $ 278     $ 382       -27 %   MoneyGuard®      18       14       29 %     44       37       19 %   Total UL      109       158       -31 %     322       419       -23 %   VUL      7       12       -42 %     23       39       -41 %   COLI and BOLI      14       13       8 %     31       54       -43 %   Term/whole life      16       7       129 %     39       18       117 %   Total sales    $ 146     $ 190       -23 %   $ 415     $ 530       -22 %                                                      Net Flows                                                    Deposits    $ 1,074     $ 1,082       -1 %   $ 3,151     $ 3,276       -4 %   Withdrawals and deaths      (512 )     (392 )     -31 %     (1,492 )     (1,258 )     -19 %   Net flows    $ 562     $ 690       -19 %   $ 1,659     $ 2,018       -18 %                                                      Contract holder assessments    $ 747     $ 705       6 %   $ 2,205     $ 2,060       7 %          99                  As of September 30,                2009       2008       Change      Account Values                      UL (1)    $ 24,631     $ 24,951       -1 %   VUL (1)      4,369       5,056       -14 %   Interest-sensitive whole life      2,272       2,276       0 %   Total account values    $ 31,272     $ 32,283       -3 %                              In-Force Face Amount                            UL and other (1)    $ 289,124     $ 306,293       -6 %   Term insurance      242,889       233,671       4 %   Total in-force face amount    $ 532,013     $ 539,964       -1 %         (1)   Effective with the March 31, 2009, coinsurance agreement, UL and VUL account values were reduced by $938 million and $640 million, respectively, and UL and other face amount in force was reduced by $20.9 billion.     Insurance fees relate only to interest-sensitive products and include mortality assessments, expense assessments (net of deferrals and amortization related to DFEL) and surrender charges. Mortality and expense assessments are deducted from our contract holders’ account values. These amounts are a function of the rates priced into the product and premiums received, face amount in force and account values. Insurance in force, in turn, is driven by sales, persistency and mortality experience. In-force growth should be considered independently with respect to term products versus UL and other products, as term products have a lower profitability relative to face amount compared to whole life and interest-sensitive products.  Sales in the table above and as discussed above were reported as follows:      ·   UL (excluding linked-benefit products) and VUL (including COLI and BOLI) – first year commissionable premiums plus 5% of excess premiums received, including an adjustment for internal replacements of approximately 50% of commissionable premiums;        ·   MoneyGuard® (our linked-benefit product) – 15% of premium deposits; and        ·   Whole life and term – 100% of first year paid premiums.     UL and VUL products with secondary guarantees represented approximately 39% of interest-sensitive life insurance in force as of September 30, 2009, and approximately 58% and 66% of sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2009. AG38 imposes additional statutory reserve requirements for these products.       100          Net Investment Income and Interest Credited  Details underlying net investment income, interest credited (in millions) and our interest rate spread were as follows:           For the Three             For the Nine                Months Ended             Months Ended                September 30,             September 30,                2009       2008       Change       2009       2008       Change      Net Investment Income                                        Fixed maturity securities, mortgage loans on real                                        estate and other, net of investment expenses    $ 487     $ 478       2 %   $ 1,454     $ 1,425       2 %   Commercial mortgage loan prepayment and                                                    bond makewhole premiums (1)      3       1       200 %     7       14       -50 %   Alternative investments (2)      (20 )     21      NM        (73 )     35      NM      Surplus investments (3)      25       22       14 %     58       67       -13 %   Total net investment income    $ 495     $ 522       -5 %   $ 1,446     $ 1,541       -6 %                                                      Interest Credited    $ 293     $ 305       -4 %   $ 886     $ 902       -2 %          (1)   See “Consolidated Investments – Commercial Mortgage Loan Prepayment and Bond Makewhole Premiums” below for additional information.

A portion of the investment income earned for this segment is credited to contract holder accounts. Invested assets will typically grow at a faster rate than account values because of the AG38 reserve requirements, which cause statutory reserves to grow at an accelerated rate. Invested assets are based upon the statutory reserve liabilities and are therefore affected by various reserve adjustments, including capital transactions providing relief from AG38 reserve requirements, which leads to a transfer of invested assets from this segment to Other Operations for use in other corporate purposes. We expect to earn a spread between what we earn on the underlying general account investments and what we credit to our contract holders’ accounts. The interest rate spread for this segment represents the excess of the yield on invested assets on reserves over the average crediting rate on interest-sensitive products. The yield on invested assets on reserves is calculated as net investment income, excluding amounts attributable to our surplus investments and reverse repurchase agreement interest expense, divided by average invested assets on reserves. In addition, we exclude the impact of earnings from affordable housing tax credit securities, which is reflected as a reduction to federal income tax expense, from our spread calculations. Traditional products use interest income to build the policy reserves. Commercial mortgage loan prepayments and bond makewhole premiums and investment income on alternative investments can vary significantly from period to period due to a number of factors, and, therefore, may contribute to investment income results that are not indicative of the underlying trends.       102          Benefits  Details underlying benefits (dollars in millions) were as follows:           For the Three             For the Nine                Months Ended             Months Ended                September 30,             September 30,                2009       2008       Change       2009       2008       Change      Benefits                                        Death claims direct and assumed    $ 541     $ 536       1 %   $ 1,643     $ 1,612       2 %   Death claims ceded      (231 )     (249 )     7 %     (719 )     (722 )     0 %   Reserves released on death      (99 )     (80 )     -24 %     (294 )     (271 )     -8 %   Net death benefits      211       207       2 %     630       619       2 %   Change in secondary guarantee life insurance                                                    product reserves:                                                    Prospective unlocking - assumption changes      (2 )     8      NM        (2 )     8      NM      Prospective unlocking - model refinements      -       76       -100 %     -       76       -100 %   Other      57       32       78 %     168       86       95 %   Change in secondary guarantee life insurance                                                    product reserves - reinsurance      (4 )     6      NM        29       6      NM      Other benefits (1)      58       71       -18 %     175       211       -17 %   Total benefits    $ 320     $ 400       -20 %   $ 1,000     $ 1,006       -1 %                                                      Death claims per $1,000 of inforce      1.61       1.55       4 %     1.59       1.55       3 %         (1)   Other benefits includes primarily traditional product changes in reserves and dividends.     Benefits for this segment includes claims incurred during the period in excess of the associated reserves for its interest-sensitive and traditional products. In addition, benefits includes the change in secondary guarantee life insurance product reserves. The reserve for secondary guarantees is impacted by changes in expected future trends of expense assessments causing unlocking adjustments to this liability similar to DAC, VOBA and DFEL. Additionally, we establish a reserve for reinsurance margin (reinsurance premiums paid less death benefit recoveries) and amortize this margin over the life of the expected insurance assessments for certain blocks of secondary guarantee UL business. When we experience unfavorable mortality, particularly on higher face amount claims, our reinsurance recoveries can increase significantly and are deferred, which reduces the amount by which the expense for the direct claims are offset by reinsurance. The reinsurance on our secondary guarantee UL business is excess of loss reinsurance, and this block has a large range of face amounts, both of which contribute to volatility in our actual experience of reinsurance recoveries as compared to our expectations.       103          Underwriting, Acquisition, Insurance and Other Expenses  Details underlying underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses (in millions) were as follows:           For the Three             For the Nine                Months Ended             Months Ended                September 30,             September 30,                2009       2008       Change       2009       2008       Change      Underwriting, Acquisition, Insurance and                                        Other Expenses                                        Commissions    $ 159     $ 209       -24 %   $ 478     $ 584       -18 %   General and administrative expenses      112       102       10 %     332       308       8 %   Taxes, licenses and fees      31       36       -14 %     87       95       -8 %   Total expenses incurred      302       347       -13 %     897       987       -9 %   DAC and VOBA deferrals      (213 )     (261 )     18 %     (635 )     (744 )     15 %   Total expenses recognized before amortization      89       86       3 %     262       243       8 %   DAC and VOBA amortization, net of interest:                                                    Prospective unlocking - assumption changes      33       (32 )     203 %     33       (32 )     203 %   Prospective unlocking - model refinements      -       (49 )     100 %     -       (49 )     100 %   Retrospective unlocking      20       26       -23 %     38       53       -28 %   Amortization, net of interest, excluding                                                    unlocking      141       135       4 %     364       403       -10 %   Other intangible amortization      1       1       0 %     3       3       0 %   Total underwriting, acquisition, insurance                                                    and other expenses    $ 284     $ 167       70 %   $ 700     $ 621       13 %                                                      DAC and VOBA Deferrals                                                    As a percentage of sales      145.9 %     137.4 %             153.0 %     140.4 %             Commissions and other general and administrative expenses that vary with and are related primarily to the production of new business are deferred to the extent recoverable and for our interest-sensitive products are generally amortized over the lives of the contracts in relation to EGPs.

When comparing DAC and VOBA deferrals as a percentage of sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2009 and 2008, the increase is a result of incurred deferrable general and administrative expenses declining at a rate lower than sales.       104          Insurance Solutions – Group Protection  Income from Operations  Details underlying the results for Insurance Solutions – Group Protection (in millions) were as follows:           For the Three             For the Nine                Months Ended             Months Ended                September 30,             September 30,                2009       2008       Change       2009       2008       Change      Operating Revenues                                        Insurance premiums    $ 379     $ 371       2 %   $ 1,183     $ 1,134       4 %   Net investment income      34       31       10 %     92       89       3 %   Other revenues and fees      1       1       0 %     4       4       0 %   Total operating revenues      414       403       3 %     1,279       1,227       4 %   Operating Expenses                                                    Interest credited      1       1       0 %     2       1       100 %   Benefits      261       268       -3 %     836       823       2 %   Underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other                                                    expenses      99       92       8 %     297       271       10 %   Total operating expenses      361       361       0 %     1,135       1,095       4 %   Income from operations before taxes      53       42       26 %     144       132       9 %   Federal income tax expense      18       15       20 %     50       46       9 %   Income from operations    $ 35     $ 27       30 %   $ 94     $ 86       9 %             For the Three             For the Nine                Months Ended             Months Ended                September 30,             September 30,                2009       2008       Change       2009       2008       Change      Income from Operations by Product Line                                        Life    $ 16     $ 9       78 %   $ 29     $ 30       -3 %   Disability      18       16       13 %     63       51       24 %   Dental      (1 )     1      NM        (3 )     1      NM      Total non-medical      33       26       27 %     89       82       9 %   Medical      2       1       100 %     5       4       25 %   Total income from operations    $ 35     $ 27       30 %   $ 94     $ 86       9 %   Comparison of the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2009 to 2008  Income from operations for this segment increased due to the following:      ·   More favorable total non-medical loss ratio experience, slightly below the low end of our expected range; and        ·   Growth in insurance premiums driven by normal, organic business growth in our non-medical products.     The increase in income from operations was partially offset by an increase to underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses due primarily to higher expenses attributable to our U.S. pension plans (see “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans” in our 2008 Form 10-K for additional information) and the increase in paid premiums, partially offset by higher costs of investments in strategic initiatives associated with realigning our marketing and distribution structure in 2008.       105          During the first nine months of 2009, we experienced exceptional short- and long-term disability loss ratios due primarily to favorable claims incidence and termination experience. We attribute the recent favorable incidence and termination experience in our long-term disability line of business to be related, at least in part, to the impact of the challenging economic environment on our insureds. Consequently, we expect to experience non-medical loss ratios over the remainder of this year around the low end of our historical expected range of 71% to 74%. In addition, we experienced unfavorable life loss ratios in the first quarter of 2009 due primarily to adverse mortality experience, the one-time adjustment noted below and the downward effects of whole-case pricing on premium rates, all of which we do not expect to recur in future quarters.  During the third quarter of 2009, certain reserving methodology changes contributed to a decrease in life loss ratios and an increase in long-term disability loss ratios, but had effectively no impact on total non-medical loss ratios.  Benefits included a one-time adjustment of $3 million in the first quarter of 2009 relating to unfavorable waiver claim reserves.  We experienced higher expenses attributable to our U.S. pension plans (see “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans” in our 2008 Form 10-K) during the first nine months of 2009, and the fourth quarter of 2009 will continue this unfavorable trend when compared to the corresponding period in 2008.  Sales relate to long-duration contracts sold to new contract holders and new programs sold to existing contract holders. We believe that the trend in sales is an important indicator of development of business in force over time.  Management focuses on trends in loss ratios to compare actual experience with pricing expectations because group-underwriting risks change over time. We expect normal fluctuations in our composite non-medical loss ratios of this segment, as claim experience is inherently uncertain. As discussed further above, we expect favorable loss ratio experience over the remainder of this year.

The premiums are a function of the rates priced into the product and our business in force. Business in force, in turn, is driven by sales and persistency experience. Sales in the table above are the combined annualized premiums for our life, disability and dental products.  The business represented as “medical” consists primarily of our non-core EXEC-U-CARE® product. This product provides an insured medical expense reimbursement vehicle to executives for non-covered health plan costs. This product produces significant revenues and benefits expenses for this segment but only a limited amount of income. Discontinuance of this product would significantly impact segment revenues, but not income from operations.  Net Investment Income  We use our interest income to build the associated policy reserves, which are a function of our insurance premiums and the yields on our invested assets.       106          Benefits and Interest Credited  Details underlying benefits and interest credited (in millions) were as follows:            For the Three             For the Nine                Months Ended             Months Ended                September 30,             September 30,                2009       2008       Change       2009       2008       Change      Benefits and Interest Credited by Product Line                                        Life    $ 95     $ 100       -5 %   $ 314     $ 293       7 %   Disability      115       116       -1 %     326       337       -3 %   Dental      29       29       0 %     92       89       3 %   Total non-medical      239       245       -2 %     732       719       2 %   Medical      23       24       -4 %     106       105       1 %   Total benefits and interest credited    $ 262     $ 269       -3 %   $ 838     $ 824       2 %                                                      Loss Ratios by Product Line                                                    Life      66.6 %     74.0 %             72.8 %     72.7 %           Disability      66.8 %     68.6 %             62.8 %     67.6 %           Dental      79.7 %     75.9 %             83.4 %     79.2 %           Total non-medical      68.1 %     71.6 %             69.0 %     70.9 %           Medical      82.0 %     86.2 %             86.9 %     87.7 %           Note: Loss ratios presented above are calculated using whole dollars instead of dollars rounded to millions.

Broker commissions, which vary with and are related to paid premiums, are expensed as incurred. The level of expenses is an important driver of profitability for this segment as group insurance contracts are offered within an environment that competes on the basis of price and service.       107          RESULTS OF OTHER OPERATIONS  Other Operations includes investments related to the excess capital in our insurance subsidiaries, investments in media properties and other corporate investments, benefit plan net assets, the unamortized deferred gain on indemnity reinsurance, which was sold to Swiss Re in 2001, external debt and business sold through reinsurance. We are actively managing our remaining radio station clusters to maximize performance and future value. Other Operations also includes the Institutional Pension business, which is a closed block of pension business, the majority of which was sold on a group annuity basis, and is currently in run-off, and the results of certain disability income business due to the rescission of this business previously sold to Swiss Re.  Loss from Operations  Details underlying the results for Other Operations (in millions) were as follows:           For the Three             For the Nine                Months Ended             Months Ended                September 30,             September 30,                2009       2008       Change       2009       2008       Change      Operating Revenues                                        Insurance premiums    $ -     $ 1       -100 %   $ 4     $ 4       0 %   Net investment income      81       90       -10 %     221       277       -20 %   Amortization of deferred gain on business                                                     sold through reinsurance      18       18       0 %     55       55       0 %   Media revenues (net)      17       21       -19 %     51       66       -23 %   Other revenues and fees      4       5       -20 %     9       10       -10 %   Total operating revenues      120       135       -11 %     340       412       -17 %   Operating Expenses                                                    Interest credited      33       43       -23 %     115       130       -12 %   Benefits      38       29       31 %     178       87       105 %   Media expenses      13       14       -7 %     40       45       -11 %   Other expenses      23       39       -41 %     120       132       -9 %   Interest and debt expenses      68       69       -1 %     194       209       -7 %   Total operating expenses      175       194       -10 %     647       603       7 %   Loss from operations before taxes      (55 )     (59 )     7 %     (307 )     (191 )     -61 %   Federal income tax benefit      (21 )     (20 )     -5 %     (112 )     (63 )     -78 %   Loss from operations    $ (34 )   $ (39 )     13 %   $ (195 )   $ (128 )     -52 %     Comparison of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2009 to 2008  Loss from operations for this segment decreased due primarily to the following:      ·   Lower other expenses attributable primarily to higher merger-related expenses in the third quarter of 2008 as a result of higher system integration work related to our administrative systems and lower branding expenses in the third quarter of 2009 due to cost save initiatives; and        ·   More favorable tax items that impacted the effective tax rate related primarily to changes in tax preferred investments.          108          The decrease in loss from operations was partially offset by the following:      ·   Lower net investment income related to our short-term liquidity strategy during the recent volatile markets that has reduced our portfolio yield and lower dividend income from our holdings of Bank of America common stock due to dividend rate cuts, partially offset by higher invested assets driven by distributable earnings received from our insurance segments, dividends received from our other segments and issuances of common stock, preferred stock and debt, partially offset by transfers to other segments for other-than-temporary impairments;        ·   Unfavorable results of our run-off disability income business due primarily to the rescission of the Swiss Re reinsurance agreement discussed below; and        ·   Lower media earnings related primarily to the general weakening of the U.S economy causing substantial declines in revenues throughout the radio market.     Comparison of the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2009 to 2008  Loss from operations for this segment increased due primarily to the following:      ·   The $64 million unfavorable impact in the first quarter of 2009 of the rescission of the reinsurance agreement on certain disability income business sold to Swiss Re as discussed in “Reinsurance” below, which resulted in pre-tax increases in benefits of $78 million, interest credited of $15 million and other expenses of $5 million, partially offset by a $34 million tax benefit;        ·   Lower net investment income related to our short-term liquidity strategy during the recent volatile markets that has reduced our portfolio yield and lower dividend income from our holdings of Bank of America common stock due to dividend rate cuts, partially offset by higher invested assets driven by distributable earnings received from our insurance segments, dividends received from our other segments and issuances of common stock, preferred stock and debt, partially offset by transfers to other segments for other-than-temporary impairments;        ·   Lower media earnings related primarily to the general weakening of the U.S economy causing substantial declines in revenues throughout the radio market; and        ·   Unfavorable results of our run-off disability income business due primarily to the rescission discussed above.     The increase in loss from operations was partially offset by the following:      ·   Lower other expenses attributable primarily to higher merger-related expenses as a result of higher system integration work related to our administrative systems and relocation costs associated with the move of our corporate office in 2008 and lower branding expenses in 2009 due to cost save initiatives, partially offset by restructuring charges of $22 million in 2009 related to expense reduction initiatives that are discussed further below;        ·   Lower interest and debt expenses as a result of a decline in interest rates that affect our variable rate borrowings and lower average balances of outstanding debt in 2009; and        ·   More favorable tax items that impacted the effective tax rate related primarily to changes in tax preferred investments.     Additional Segment Information  We expect lower media earnings in 2009 than was experienced in 2008, as our customers have reduced their advertising expenses in response to the economic conditions.  We expect lower investment income in 2009 as compared to 2008 due to lower dividend income from our holdings of Bank of America common stock as it announced dividend rate cuts during the latter part of 2008 and early 2009, partially offset by higher investment income of $2 million per quarter prospectively related to the coinsurance agreement that we entered into on March 31, 2009 (see “Results of Insurance Solutions – Insurance Solutions – Life Insurance” and “Reinsurance” for more information) and by the net investment income earned on the proceeds received from the issuance of common stock and debt during the second quarter of 2009 and preferred stock and a common stock warrant during the third quarter of 2009, which is discussed in more detail below in “Review of Consolidated Financial Condition – Liquidity and Capital Resources – Financing Activities.”  The inclusion of run-off disability income business results within Other Operations due to the rescission of the Swiss Re reinsurance agreement mentioned above may create volatility in earnings going forward. As part of our transition plan related to the rescission, we are conducting a reserve study to determine whether or not reserves are adequate to cover contract holder obligations. This study, which we expect to complete during the fourth quarter of 2009, could result in an adjustment to the reserves that we have assumed from Swiss Re pursuant to the rescission agreement.       109          Sustained market volatility and the challenging economic environment continue to put pressure on many industries and companies, including our own. After reviewing the impact of this difficult economy on our anticipated sales and business activities, we initiated actions in the fourth quarter of 2008 to streamline operations, reduce expenses and ensure that staffing levels were aligned with expected business activity. Additionally, we initiated a second expense reduction initiative in the second quarter of 2009, as discussed below. We focused on reducing the workforce, reducing capital spending and addressing corporate-wide discretionary spending.  As a result of shrinking revenues due to the impact of unfavorable equity markets on our asset management businesses and a reduction in sales volumes caused by the unfavorable economic environment, we launched further initiatives to reduce expenses, including a 12% workforce reduction that was substantially completed in the second quarter of 2009, that we believe will improve our capital position and preserve profits. The restructuring costs associated with these layoffs are included in other expenses within Other Operations.  For factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in this section, see “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2008 Form 10-K and “Forward-Looking Statements – Cautionary Language” in this report.  We provide information about this segment’s operating revenue and operating expense line items, the period in which amounts are recognized, key drivers of changes and historical details underlying the line items and their associated drivers below.  Net Investment Income and Interest Credited  We utilize an internal formula to determine the amount of capital that is allocated to our business segments. Investment income on capital in excess of the calculated amounts is reported in Other Operations. If regulations require increases in our insurance segments’ statutory reserves and surplus, the amount of capital allocated to Other Operations would decrease and net investment income would be negatively impacted. In addition, as discussed below in “Review of Consolidated Financial Condition – Alternative Sources of Liquidity,” we maintain an inter-segment cash management program where certain subsidiaries can borrow from or lend money to the holding company to meet short-term borrowing needs. The inter-segment cash management program affects net investment income for Other Operations, as all inter-segment eliminations are reported within Other Operations.  Write-downs for other-than-temporary impairments decrease the recorded value of our invested assets owned by our business segments. These write-downs are not included in the income from operations of our operating segments. When impairment occurs, assets are transferred to the business segments’ portfolios and will reduce the future net investment income for Other Operations, but should not have an impact on a consolidated basis unless the impairments are related to defaulted securities. Statutory reserve adjustments for our business segments can also cause allocations of invested assets between the affected segments and Other Operations.  The majority of our interest credited relates to our reinsurance operations sold to Swiss Re in 2001. A substantial amount of the business was sold through indemnity reinsurance transactions resulting in some of the business still flowing through our consolidated financial statements. The interest credited corresponds to investment income earnings on the assets we continue to hold for this business. There is no impact to income or loss in Other Operations or on a consolidated basis for these amounts.  Benefits  Benefits are recognized when incurred for Institutional Pension products and disability income business.       110          Other Expenses  Details underlying other expenses (in millions) were as follows:           For the Three             For the Nine                Months Ended             Months Ended                September 30,             September 30,                2009       2008       Change       2009       2008       Change      Other Expenses                                        Merger-related expenses    $ 3     $ 13       -77 %   $ 14     $ 44       -68 %   Restructuring charges for expense initiatives      1       -      NM        34       -      NM      Branding      4       8       -50 %     13       27       -52 %   Retirement Income Security Ventures      2       4       -50 %     6       9       -33 %   Taxes, licenses and fees      (1 )     2      NM        4       5       -20 %   Other      14       12       17 %     49       47       4 %   Total other expenses    $ 23     $ 39       -41 %   $ 120     $ 132       -9 %     Other in the table above includes expenses that are corporate in nature including charitable contributions, certain litigation reserves, amortization of media intangible assets with a definite life, other expenses not allocated to our business segments and inter-segment expense eliminations.  Merger-related expenses were the result of actions undertaken by us to eliminate duplicate operations and functions as a result of the Jefferson-Pilot merger along with costs related to the implementation of our new unified product portfolio and other initiatives. Although these actions were substantially completed in the first nine months of 2009, we expect to incur up to $6 million of merger-related expenses during the remainder of 2009. Our current estimate of the cumulative integration expenses is approximately $215 million to $225 million, pre-tax, and excludes amounts capitalized or recorded as goodwill.  Starting in December 2008, we implemented a restructuring plan in response to the current economic downturn and sustained market volatility, which focused on reducing expenses. During the fourth quarter of 2008, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $8 million. The expenses associated with this initiative are reported in restructuring charges for expense initiatives above. We expect our cumulative pre-tax charges to amount to $43 million for severance, benefits and related costs associated with the plan for workforce reduction and other restructuring actions.  Interest and Debt Expenses  Our current level of interest expense may not be indicative of the future due to, among other things, the timing of the use of cash, the availability of funds from our inter-company cash management program and the future cost of capital.

For factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in this section, see “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2008 Form 10-K and “Forward-Looking Statements – Cautionary Language” in this report.  For information on our counterparty exposure see “Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.”       112          Comparison of the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2009 to 2008  GLB net derivatives results declined due primarily to the NPR component of the liability being unfavorable in 2009 attributable to a narrowing of credit spreads. See “GLB Net Derivatives Results” below for a discussion of how our NPR adjustment is determined. This decline was partially offset by significantly more favorable GLB hedge program performance in 2009 relative to 2008. In 2008, the result was largely driven by extremely volatile capital markets. At the end of the second quarter of 2009, we made a strategic decision to reduce our interest rate coverage as we prepare for the adoption of VACARVM, which is effective for statutory accounting on December 31, 2009. The reduced coverage on rates may create some GAAP earnings volatility going forward. Also, as a result of this reduction in coverage of interest rate changes, we estimate that for every one basis point increase in interest rates, we will experience an immediate $1 million unfavorable impact to earnings.  The third quarter of 2009 had unfavorable prospective unlocking of assumptions associated with the GLB reserves reflecting primarily updates to our lapse assumption. The third quarter of 2008 had favorable unlocking of assumptions associated with the GLB reserves reflecting primarily updates to implied ultimate volatility.  The third quarter of 2008 had unfavorable prospective DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL unlocking related to the GLB reserves reflecting the impact of incorporating the change in EGPs resulting from the change in assumptions for the reserves discussed above into the DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL models.  The decline in the realized loss related to certain investments was attributable primarily to the lower OTTI. This is due to some improvement in the credit markets and the change in the accounting for impairments under the Investments – Debt and Equity Securities Topic of the FASB ASC that is effective for impairments recorded after January 1, 2009. For a further explanation of this change, see Note 2. For more information on realized losses on certain investments, see “Consolidated Investments – Realized Loss Related to Investments” below.  The gain on certain reinsurance derivative/trading securities in 2009 was due primarily to the rescission of the Swiss Re indemnity reinsurance agreement covering certain disability income business, whereby we released the embedded derivative liability related to the funds withheld nature of the reinsurance agreement. Prior to the rescission of the Swiss Re indemnity reinsurance agreement, the fluctuations in the fair value of the trading securities mostly offset the fair value fluctuations in the embedded derivative of the reinsurance agreement with the net difference reported as a realized gain or loss. The release of this embedded derivative liability increased net income by approximately $31 million in the first quarter of 2009. Since the rescission, this line item is impacted by market conditions as we now have trading securities that are no longer supporting an embedded derivative liability due to the rescission causing us to release that liability. Consequently, we may experience more volatility in the fluctuation of this component of realized gain or loss in the future. During the third quarter of 2009, the value of these trading securities increased due to changes in interest rates.

Operating realized gain (loss) includes the following:  Indexed Annuity Net Derivative Results  Indexed annuity net derivatives results represent the net difference between the change in the fair value of the S&P 500 Index® (“S&P 500”) call options that we hold and the change in the fair value of the embedded derivative liabilities of our indexed annuity products. The change in the fair value of the liability for the embedded derivative represents the amount that is credited to the indexed annuity contract.  GLB  Our GWB, GIB and 4LATER® features have elements of both benefit reserves and embedded derivative reserves. We calculate the value of the embedded derivative reserve and the benefit reserve based on the specific characteristics of each GLB feature. For our GLBs that meet the definition of an embedded derivative under the Derivatives and Hedging Topic of the FASB ASC, we record them at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in realized loss on our Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss). In bifurcating the embedded derivative, we attribute to the embedded derivative the portion of total fees collected from the contract holder that relates to the GLB riders (the “attributed fees”). These attributed fees represent the present value of future claims expected to be paid for the GLB at the inception of the contract (the “net valuation premium”) plus a margin that a theoretical market participant would include for risk/profit (the “risk/profit margin”).       114          Our methodology for calculating the NPR component of the embedded derivative reserve utilizes an extrapolated 30-year NPR spread curve applied to a series of expected cash flows over the expected life of the embedded derivative. Our cash flows consist of both expected fees to be received from contract holders and benefits to be paid, and these cash flows are different on a pre- and post- NPR basis are different. The difference in the cash flows this quarter resulted in an increase to the GLB reserve liability in excess of the liability that we hedge. We utilize a model based on our holding company’s CDS spreads adjusted for items, such as the liquidity of our holding company CDS. Because the guaranteed benefit liabilities are contained within our insurance subsidiaries, we apply items, such as the impact of our insurance subsidiaries’ claims-paying ratings compared to holding company credit risk and the over-collateralization of insurance liabilities, in order to determine factors that are representative of a theoretical market participant’s view of the NPR of the specific liability within our insurance subsidiaries. Details underlying the NPR component and associated impact to our GLB embedded derivative reserves (dollars in millions) were as follows:           As of       As of       As of       As of          September 30,       June 30,       March 31,       December 31,          2009       2009       2009       2008      10-year CDS spread      2.49 %     5.52 %     23.25 %     6.34 %   NPR factor related to 10-year CDS spread      0.20 %     0.82 %     1.49 %     1.23 %   Unadjusted embedded derivative liability    $ 1,014     $ 1,197     $ 3,064     $ 3,416       We experienced significant widening of our CDS spreads during the first quarter of 2009. We compared our CDS spreads to those of our peer companies with similar holding company ratings and determined that our company specific spreads were significantly wider due to the market’s concerns over our holding company liquidity. As a result, we reduced the spreads used in the calculation of our NPR factors to be in line with our peers. Therefore, the starting point for our spreads was reduced over the entire term structure with the 10-year at 8.45%.  The $212 million change in the NPR component of the liability from June 30, 2009, to September 30, 2009, was attributable primarily to change in the NPR factors. Estimating what the absolute amount of the NPR effect will be period to period is difficult due to the utilization of all cash flows and the shape of the spread curve. For the third quarter of 2009, the spread curve flattened significantly relative to prior quarters. Currently, we estimate that if the NPR factors as of September 30, 2009, were to have been zero along all points on the spread curve, then the NPR offset to the unadjusted liability would have resulted in an unfavorable impact to net income of approximately $100 million, pre-DAC* and tax. Alternatively, if the NPR factors were 20 basis points higher along all points on the spread curve as of September 30, 2009, then there would have been a favorable impact to net income of approximately $100 million, pre-DAC* and tax. Changing market conditions could cause this relationship to deviate significantly in future periods. Sensitivity within this range is primarily a result of volatility in our CDS spreads and the slope of the CDS spread term structure.      *   DAC refers to the associated amortization of DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL.     We include the risk/profit margin portion of the GLB attributed rider fees in operating realized gain and include the net valuation premium of the GLB attributed rider fees in excluded realized (loss). For our Retirement Solutions – Annuities and Retirement Solutions – Defined Contribution segments, the excess of total fees collected from the contract holders over the GLB attributed rider fees is reported in insurance fees.  We also include the change in the fair value of the derivatives that offsets the change in GLB benefit ratio reserves. The change in GLB benefit ratio reserves attributable to the Retirement Solutions business is offset in benefits within income from operations. This approach excludes the change in benefit ratio reserves from income from operations according to our definition of income from operations and instead reflects it within GLB net derivatives results, a component of excluded realized (loss). On our Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss), the change in benefit ratio reserves is reported within benefits.  GDB  GDB represents the change in the fair value of the derivatives that offsets the change in GDB benefit ratio reserves, including our expected cost of the hedging instruments. The change in GDB benefit ratio reserves attributable to the Retirement Solutions business is offset in benefits within income from operations. This approach excludes the change in benefit ratio reserves from income from operations according to our definition of income from operations and instead reflects it within GDB derivatives results, a component of excluded realized (loss). On our Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss), the change in benefit ratio reserves is reported within benefits.       115          Realized Loss Related to Certain Investments  See “Consolidated Investments – Realized Loss Related to Investments” below.  Gain (Loss) on Certain Reinsurance Derivative/Trading Securities  Gain (loss) on certain reinsurance derivative/trading securities represents changes in the fair values of total return swaps (embedded derivatives) theoretically included in our various modified coinsurance and coinsurance with funds withheld reinsurance arrangements that have contractual returns related to various assets and liabilities associated with these arrangements.       116          GLB Net Derivatives Results and GDB Derivatives Results  Details underlying GLB net derivatives results and GDB derivative results (in millions) were as follows:           For the Three             For the Nine                Months Ended             Months Ended                September 30,             September 30,                2009       2008       Change       2009       2008       Change      GLB Net Derivatives Results                                        Net valuation premium, net of reinsurance    $ 31     $ 21       48 %   $ 81     $ 58       40 %   Change in reserves hedged:                                                    Prospective unlocking - assumption changes      (17 )     80      NM        (17 )     80      NM      Prospective unlocking - model refinements      (9 )     -      NM        (9 )     -      NM      Other      210       (651 )     132 %     2,419       (812 )    NM      Change in market value of derivative assets      (241 )     319      NM        (2,385 )     388      NM      Hedge program effectiveness                                                    (ineffectiveness)      (57 )     (252 )     77 %     8       (344 )     102 %   Change in reserves not hedged (NPR                                                    component)      (212 )     372      NM        (600 )     481      NM      Change in derivative assets not hedged (NPR                                                    component)      5       -      NM        10       -      NM      Change in benefit ratio reserves not hedged      7       -      NM        14       -      NM      Associated amortization expense of DAC,                                                    VOBA, DSI and DFEL:                                                    Prospective unlocking - assumption changes      -       (31 )     100 %     -       (31 )     100 %   Retrospective unlocking (1)      (75 )     (69 )     -9 %     (216 )     (59 )    NM      Amortization, excluding unlocking      79       48       65 %     209       14      NM      Loss from the initial adoption of new accounting                                                    standard, after-DAC (2) (3)      -       -      NM        -       (34 )     100 %   Total GLB net derivatives results    $ (222 )   $ 89      NM      $ (494 )   $ 85      NM                                                         GDB Derivatives Results                                                    Change in benefit ratio reserves    $ 84     $ (51 )     265 %   $ 120     $ (66 )     282 %   Change in fair value of derivatives, excluding                                                    expected cost of hedging instruments      (97 )     8      NM        (203 )     10      NM      Associated amortization expense of DAC,                                                    VOBA, DSI and DFEL:                                                    Retrospective unlocking (1)      (5 )     (16 )     69 %     (36 )     (17 )    NM      Amortization, excluding unlocking      7       26       -73 %     49       32       53 %   Total GDB derivatives results    $ (11 )   $ (33 )     67 %   $ (70 )   $ (41 )     -71 %            (1)   Related primarily to the emergence of gross profits.

GLB Net Derivatives Results  Our GLB net derivatives results are comprised of the net valuation premium, the change in the GLB embedded derivative reserves and the change in the fair value of the derivative instruments we own to hedge them, including the cost of purchasing the hedging instruments.       117          Our GWB, GIB and 4LATER® features have elements of both benefit reserves and embedded derivative reserves. The benefit ratio reserve component is calculated in a manner consistent with our GDB benefit ratio reserves. We calculate the value of the embedded derivative reserve and the benefit reserve based on the specific characteristics of each GLB feature. We record the embedded derivative reserve on our GLBs at fair value on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We use derivative instruments to hedge our exposure to the risks and earnings volatility that result from changes in the GLB embedded derivatives reserves. The change in fair value of these derivative instruments is designed to generally offset the change in embedded derivative reserves. In the table above, we have presented the components of our GLB results, which can be volatile especially when sudden and significant changes in equity markets and/or interest rates occur. When we assess the effectiveness of our hedge program, we exclude the impact of the change in the component of the embedded derivative reserves related to the required NPR. We do not attempt to hedge the change in the NPR component of the liability. As of September 30, 2009, the net effect of the NPR resulted in an $87 million increase in the liability for our GLB embedded derivative reserves. See above for information regarding the effect of the NPR on the GLB net derivatives results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2009 and 2008. For additional information on our guaranteed benefits, see “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Derivatives – Guaranteed Living Benefits” above. For additional information on our hedge program see “Reinsurance” below.  Our GLB net derivatives results also include the change in GLB benefit ratio reserves. The change in GLB benefit ratio reserves is offset in GLB operating realized gain (loss). See “GLB” above for additional information.  GDB Derivatives Results  Our GDB derivatives results represent the net difference between the change in GDB benefit ratio reserves and the change in the fair value of the derivative instruments we own to hedge the change in our benefit ratio reserves, excluding our expected cost of the hedging instruments. The change in GDB benefit ratio reserves is offset in GDB operating realized gain (loss). See “GDB” above for additional information.

These fair values represent an estimate of the cost of the options we will purchase in the future, discounted back to the date of the balance sheet, using current market indications of volatility and interest rates, which can vary significantly from period to period due to a number of factors and therefore can provide results that are not indicative of the underlying trends.       118          CONSOLIDATED INVESTMENTS  The MD&A included in our 2008 Form 10-K contains detailed information and discussion of our consolidated investments. The following updates "Consolidated Investments" provided in our 2008 Form 10-K and, accordingly, should be read in conjunction with the "Consolidated Investments" in our Form 10-K. See Note 5 for more information related to our consolidated investments. For a discussion on our risk management process, see “Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.”  Residential Mortgage-Baked Securities (“RMBS”)  Our AFS fixed maturity securities include RMBS, which are backed by residential mortgages. These securities are backed by loans that are characterized by borrowers of differing levels of creditworthiness: prime, Alt-A and subprime. Prime lending is the origination of residential mortgage loans to customers with excellent credit profiles. Alt-A lending is the origination of residential mortgage loans to customers who have prime credit profiles but lack documentation to substantiate income. Subprime lending is the origination of loans to customers with weak or impaired credit profiles.  The slowing U.S. housing market, increased interest rates for non-prime borrowers and relaxed underwriting standards over the last several years have led to higher delinquency rates for residential mortgage loans and home equity loans. We expect delinquency rates and loss rates on residential mortgages and home equity loans to increase in the future; however, we continue to expect to receive payments in accordance with contractual terms for a significant amount of our securities, largely due to the seniority of the claims on the collateral of the securities that we own. The tranches of the securities will experience losses according to their seniority level with the least senior (or most junior), typically the unrated residual tranche, taking the initial loss. The credit ratings of our securities reflect the seniority of the securities that we own. Our RMBS had a market value of $9.6 billion and an unrealized loss of $642 million, or 7%, as of September 30, 2009. The unrealized loss was due primarily to deteriorating fundamentals and a general level of illiquidity in the market resulting in price declines in many structured products.       119          The market value of investments backed by subprime loans was $417 million and represented less than 1% of our total investment portfolio as of September 30, 2009. Investments rated A or above represented 65% of the subprime investments and $202 million in market value of our subprime investments was backed by loans originating in 2005 and forward. AFS securities represent $405 million, or 97%, of the subprime exposure and trading securities represent $12 million, or 3%, as of September 30, 2009.

Changing economic conditions impact our valuation of mortgage loans. Changing vacancies and rents are incorporated into the discounted cash flow analysis that we perform for monitored loans and may contribute to the establishment of (or an increase or decrease in) an allowance for credit losses. In addition, we continue to monitor the entire commercial mortgage loan portfolio to identify risk. Areas of emphasis are properties that have deteriorating credits or have experienced debt coverage reduction. Where warranted, we have established or increased loss reserves based upon this analysis. There were nine impaired mortgage loans as of September 30, 2009, or less than 1% of the total dollar amount of mortgage loans, and no impaired mortgage loans as of December 31, 2008. As of September 30, 2009, there were seven commercial mortgage loans that were two or more payments delinquent. As of December 31, 2008, there were no commercial mortgage loans that were two or more payments delinquent. The carrying value on the mortgage loans that were two or more payments delinquent as of September 30, 2009, was $45 million, or less than 1%, of total mortgage loans. The total principal and interest past due on the mortgage loans that were two or more payments delinquent as of September 30, 2009, was $2 million. See Note 1 in our 2008 Form 10-K for more information regarding our accounting policy relating to the impairment of mortgage loans.       122          Alternative Investments  The carrying value of our consolidated alternative investments by business segment (in millions), which consists primarily of investments in limited partnerships, was as follows:           As of       As of          September 30,       December 31,          2009       2008      Retirement Solutions:                Annuities    $ 77     $ 89     Defined Contribution      61       72     Insurance Solutions:                    Life Insurance      480       603     Group Protection      29       8     Other Operations      33       4     Total alternative investments    $ 680     $ 776       Income (loss) derived from our consolidated alternative investments by business segment (in millions) was as follows:           For the Three             For the Nine                Months Ended             Months Ended                September 30,             September 30,                2009       2008       Change       2009       2008       Change      Retirement Solutions:                                        Annuities    $ 2     $ 2       0 %   $ (6 )   $ 1      NM      Defined Contribution      2       1       100 %     (3 )     (2 )     -50 %   Insurance Solutions:                                                    Life Insurance      (17 )     23      NM        (79 )     36      NM      Group Protection      1       1       0 %     (2 )     1      NM      Other Operations      1       -      NM        2       -      NM      Total alternative investments (1)    $ (11 )   $ 27      NM      $ (88 )   $ 36      NM           (1)   Includes net investment income on the alternative investments supporting the required statutory surplus of our insurance businesses.     The decline in our investment income on alternative investments in the nine months ended September 30, 2009, as compared to the same period in 2008 presented in the table above was due to the impact of audit adjustments related to completion of calendar-year financial statement audits of the investments within our portfolio and deterioration of the financial markets. The nature of these adjustments is discussed further below. This weakness was concentrated primarily in our energy, domestic venture capital and real estate limited partnership holdings.  As of September 30, 2009, and December 31, 2008, alternative investments included investments in approximately 100 different partnerships. The partnerships represent a broadly diversified portfolio of asset classes. The investment strategy of the alternative investment portfolio is to provide incremental investment income compared to the traditional fixed-income and equity markets over a long term investment horizon. In addition, the portfolio represents less than 1% of our overall invested assets. The portfolio is actively monitored to minimize the likelihood of material investment income losses.       123          The carrying value of our consolidated alternative investments by asset class (in millions) was as follows:           As of       As of          September 30,       December 31,          2009       2008                     Venture capital    $ 308     $ 341     Hedge funds      182       223     Real estate      90       110     Oil and gas      100       102     Total alternative investments    $ 680     $ 776       The partnerships do not represent off-balance sheet financing and generally involve several third-party partners. Some of our partnerships contain capital calls, which require us to contribute capital upon notification by the general partner. These capital calls are contemplated during the initial investment decision and are planned for well in advance of the call date. The capital calls are not material in size and are not material to our liquidity. The capital calls are included on the table of contingent commitments in “Review of Consolidated Financial Condition – Liquidity and Capital Resources” in our 2008 Form 10-K. Alternative investments are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and are included in other investments on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Our venture capital portfolio is mainly comprised of private equity investments in various leveraged buyout and venture capital limited partnerships, which in turn, invest in a well-diversified portfolio across various industry sectors, geographies, and investment stages. The objective of making such investments is to achieve an excess long-term risk-adjusted return.  The hedge fund portfolio is broadly diversified and contains exposure to the strategies which we believe will have the best long-term risk-adjusted returns.  The real estate limited partnership portfolio tries to capture value-added returns in both equity and mezzanine positions in both traditional and specialized areas of the commercial and residential real estate markets including workforce housing.  Similar to our venture capital portfolio, we invest in various oil and gas limited partnerships that target a well diversified energy sector including exploration and production, storage and distribution (midstream), oil field services, and other energy-related services.  We account for our investments in limited partnerships (“LPs”) using the equity method to determine the GAAP carrying value. The LPs where LNC is a participant generally report their assets at fair value. Since the assets of the LPs are measured at fair value and the values of the LPs’ liabilities would generally approximate fair value according to the audited financial statements received from the partnerships, the GAAP carrying value on our consolidated balance sheet would approximate a fair value for our LP investments.  Recognition of alternative investment income is delayed due to the availability of the related financial statements, as our venture capital, real estate and oil and gas portfolios are generally on a three-month delay and our hedge funds are on a one-month delay and are generally obtained from the partnerships’ general partners. In addition, the impact of audit adjustments related to completion of calendar-year financial statement audits of the investees are typically received after the filing of Form 10-K during the second quarter of each calendar year. Accordingly, our investment income from alternative investments for any calendar year period may not include the complete impact of the change in the underlying net assets for the partnership for that calendar year period.       124          Annually, typically during the first or second quarter, we obtain audited financial statements for our alternative investment partnerships for the preceding calendar year and recognize adjustments to the extent that audited equity of the investee differs from the equity used for reporting in prior quarters. Accordingly, our investment income from alternative investments for any calendar year period may not include the complete impact of the change in the underlying net assets for the partnership for that calendar year period. When we record audit adjustments, it impacts our investment income from alternative investments in the period that the adjustments are recorded. Our investment income from alternative investments for the second quarter of 2009 included a pre-tax loss of $71 million, of which $57 million of the losses were attributable to audit adjustments to partnerships’ 2008 financial statements. The breakdown of these audit adjustments by segment were as follows: $50 million for Insurance Solutions – Life Insurance; $1 million for Insurance Solutions – Group Protection; $3 million for Retirement Solutions – Annuities; and $3 million for Retirement Solutions – Defined Contribution. Our investment income from alternative investments for the third quarter of 2009 included a $12 million, pre-tax, loss which was attributable to audit adjustments to partnerships’ 2008 financial statements for our Insurance Solutions – Life Insurance segment.  Non-Income Producing Investments  As of September 30, 2009, and December 31, 2008, the carrying amount of fixed maturity securities, mortgage loans on real estate and real estate that were non-income producing was $28 million and $15 million, respectively.  Net Investment Income  Details underlying net investment income (loss) (in millions) and our investment yield were as follows:           For the Three             For the Nine                Months Ended             Months Ended                September 30,             September 30,                2009       2008       Change       2009       2008       Change      Net Investment Income                                        Fixed maturity AFS securities    $ 899     $ 833       8 %   $ 2,577     $ 2,510       3 %   Equity AFS securities      2       6       -67 %     5       22       -77 %   Trading securities      40       41       -2 %     119       126       -6 %   Mortgage loans on real estate      114       120       -5 %     349       354       -1 %   Real estate      4       4       0 %     10       15       -33 %   Standby real estate equity commitments      -       1       -100 %     1       3       -67 %   Policy loans      42       46       -9 %     128       133       -4 %   Invested cash      1       9       -89 %     13       39       -67 %   Commercial mortgage loan prepayment and                                                    bond makewhole premiums (1)      6       8       -25 %     11       28       -61 %   Alternative investments (2)      (11 )     27      NM        (88 )     36      NM      Consent fees      1       2       -50 %     4       4       0 %   Other investments      3       -      NM        8       (3 )    NM      Investment income      1,101       1,097       0 %     3,137       3,267       -4 %   Investment expense      (30 )     (29 )     -3 %     (82 )     (96 )     15 %   Net investment income    $ 1,071     $ 1,068       0 %   $ 3,055     $ 3,171       -4 %         (1)   See “Commercial Mortgage Loan Prepayment and Bond Makewhole Premiums” below for additional information.

The profitability of our fixed annuity and life insurance products is affected by our ability to achieve target spreads, or margins, between the interest income earned on the general account assets and the interest credited to the contract holder on our average fixed account values, including the fixed portion of variable. Net investment income and the interest rate yield table each include commercial mortgage loan prepayments and bond makewhole premiums, alternative investments and contingent interest and standby real estate equity commitments. These items can vary significantly from period to period due to a number of factors and therefore can provide results that are not indicative of the underlying trends.  The decline in net investment income when comparing the first nine months of 2009 to the same period in 2008 was attributable to a decline in investment income on alternative investments in conjunction with our liquidity strategy of maintaining higher cash balances in the first half of the year during the more volatile markets reducing portfolio yield. We expect to continue to reduce this excess liquidity in future quarters as a result of the recent improvement in the capital markets.  Standby Real Estate Equity Commitments  Periodically, we enter into standby commitments, which obligate us to purchase real estate at a specified cost if a third-party sale does not occur within approximately one year after construction is completed. These commitments are used by a developer to obtain a construction loan from an outside lender on favorable terms. In return for issuing the commitment, we receive an annual fee and a percentage of the profit when the property is sold. Our long-term expectation is that we will be obligated to fund a small portion of these commitments. However, due to the current economic environment, we may experience increased funding obligations.  As of September 30, 2009, and December 31, 2008, we had standby real estate equity commitments totaling $220 million and $267 million, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2009, we funded commitments of $46 million and the fair value of the associated real estate of $32 million is included on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, which resulted in the recognition of $14 million in realized losses. In addition, we recorded an estimated loss of $20 million in the second quarter of 2009 on one project due to our belief that our requirement to fund the project in accordance with the Standby Contingent Equity Acquisition Program (“CAP”) agreement is probable.  Commercial Mortgage Loan Prepayment and Bond Makewhole Premiums  Prepayment and makewhole premiums are collected when borrowers elect to call or prepay their debt prior to the stated maturity. A prepayment or makewhole premium allows investors to attain the same yield as if the borrower made all scheduled interest payments until maturity. These premiums are designed to make investors indifferent to prepayment.       126          The decline in prepayment and makewhole premiums when comparing the nine months ended September 30, 2009 to 2008 was attributable primarily to the continued tightening of credit conditions in the market resulting in less refinancing activity and less prepayment income.  Realized Loss Related to Investments  The detail of the realized loss related to investments (in millions) was as follows:           For the Three             For the Nine                Months Ended             Months Ended                September 30,             September 30,                2009       2008       Change       2009       2008       Change      Fixed maturity AFS securities:                  Gross gains    $ 23     $ 19       21 %   $ 110     $ 44       150 %   Gross losses      (166 )     (372 )     55 %     (579 )     (592 )     2 %   Equity AFS securities:                      Gross gains      -       1       -100 %     4       1      NM      Gross losses      (8 )     (25 )     68 %     (16 )     (32 )     50 %   Gain on other investments      2       1       100 %     (58 )     29      NM      Associated amortization expense of DAC, VOBA,                      DSI and DFEL and changes in other contract                      holder funds and funds withheld                      reinsurance liabilities      25       91       -73 %     128       139       -8 %   Total realized loss on investments, excluding    (124 )     (285 )     56 %     (411 )     (411 )     0 %   trading securities                      Loss on certain derivative instruments      (12 )     (30 )     60 %     (33 )     (62 )     47 %   Total realized loss on investments and                      certain derivative instruments,                      excluding trading securities    $ (136 )   $ (315 )     57 %   $ (444 )   $ (473 )     6 %    Amortization expense of DAC, VOBA, DSI, DFEL and changes in other contract holder funds reflects an assumption for an expected level of credit-related investment losses. When actual credit-related investment losses are realized, we recognize a true up to our DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL amortization and changes in other contract holder funds within realized loss reflecting the incremental impact of actual versus expected credit-related investment losses. These actual to expected amortization adjustments could create volatility in net realized gains and losses. The write-down for impairments includes both credit-related and interest-rate related impairments.  Realized gains and losses generally originate from asset sales to reposition the portfolio or to respond to product experience. During the first nine months of 2009 and 2008, we sold securities for gains and losses. In the process of evaluating whether a security with an unrealized loss reflects declines that are other-than-temporary, we consider our ability and intent to sell the security prior to a recovery of value. However, subsequent decisions on securities sales are made within the context of overall risk monitoring, assessing value relative to other comparable securities and overall portfolio maintenance. Although our portfolio managers may, at a given point in time, believe that the preferred course of action is to hold securities with unrealized losses that are considered temporary until such losses are recovered, the dynamic nature of portfolio management may result in a subsequent decision to sell. These subsequent decisions are consistent with the classification of our investment portfolio as AFS. We expect to continue to manage all non-trading invested assets within our portfolios in a manner that is consistent with the AFS classification.  We consider economic factors and circumstances within countries and industries where recent write-downs have occurred in our assessment of the status of securities we own of similarly situated issuers. While it is possible for realized or unrealized losses on a particular investment to affect other investments, our risk management has been designed to identify correlation risks and other risks inherent in managing an investment portfolio. Once identified, strategies and procedures are developed to effectively monitor and manage these risks. The areas of risk correlation that we pay particular attention to are risks that may be correlated within specific financial and business markets, risks within specific industries and risks associated with related parties.       127          When the detailed analysis by our credit analysts and investment portfolio managers leads to the conclusion that a security’s decline in fair value is other-than-temporary, the security is written down to estimated recovery value. In instances where declines are considered temporary, the security will continue to be carefully monitored. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis – Introduction – Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” in our 2008 Form 10-K for additional information on our portfolio management strategy.

Losses in the first nine months of 2009 were primarily attributable to certain corporate bond holdings within the Financial, Automotive and Gaming sectors, as well as deteriorating fundamentals within the housing market which affected select RMBS holdings.  The $134 million of impairments taken during the third quarter of 2009 relates to credit related impairments. The credit related impairments are largely attributable to our RMBS and mortgage-related ABS holdings that have suffered from continued deterioration in housing fundamentals. The non-credit related impairments were incurred due to declines in values of securities for which we have an intent to sell.    We have investments in Royal Bank of Scotland (“RBS”) and Lloyds Banking Group. These investments consist primarily of hybrid and redeemable preferred stocks and are reported in fixed maturity AFS securities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. On November 3, 2009, both RBS and Lloyds Banking Group received U.K. government infusion and agreed to certain terms, related primarily to asset sales, cash bonus limitations and deferral of dividends. As of October 30, 2009, our amortized cost and fair value for both of these investments totaled approximately $300 million and $200 million, respectively. We are evaluating the impact of these agreed upon terms and what if any impact they have on the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected on our investments.   REINSURANCE  Our insurance companies cede insurance to other companies. The portion of risks exceeding each of our insurance companies’ retention limits is reinsured with other insurers. We seek reinsurance coverage within the businesses that sell life insurance to limit our exposure to mortality losses and enhance our capital management. We utilize inter-company reinsurance agreements to manage our statutory capital position as well as our hedge program for variable annuity guarantees. These inter-company agreements do not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements.       128          Portions of our deferred annuity business have been reinsured on a modified coinsurance basis with other companies to limit our exposure to interest rate risks. As of September 30, 2009, the reserves associated with these reinsurance arrangements totaled $1.0 billion. To cover products other than life insurance, we acquire other insurance coverage with retentions and limits that management believes are appropriate for the circumstances. The consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 reflect premiums, benefits and DAC, net of insurance ceded. Our insurance companies remain liable if their reinsurers are unable to meet contractual obligations under applicable reinsurance agreements.  Our amounts recoverable from reinsurers represent receivables from and reserves ceded to reinsurers. As of September 30, 2009, and December 31, 2008, the amounts recoverable from reinsurers were $7.7 billion and $8.4 billion, respectively. We obtain reinsurance from a diverse group of reinsurers, and we monitor concentration and financial strength ratings of our principal reinsurers. Swiss Re represents our largest exposure. In 2001, we sold our reinsurance business to Swiss Re primarily through indemnity reinsurance arrangements. Because we are not relieved of our liability to the ceding companies for this business, the liabilities and obligations associated with the reinsured policies remain on our Consolidated Balance Sheets with a corresponding reinsurance receivable from the business sold to Swiss Re, which totaled $3.2 billion and $4.5 billion as of September 30, 2009, and December 31, 2008, respectively. Swiss Re has funded a trust with a balance of $2.0 billion as of September 30, 2009, to support this business. As a result of Swiss Re’s S&P financial strength rating dropping below AA-, Swiss Re was required to fund an additional trust of approximately $1.8 billion as of September 30, 2009, to support this business. Swiss Re funded the new trust in October of 2009. In addition to various remedies that we would have in the event of a default by Swiss Re, we continue to hold assets in support of certain of the transferred reserves. These assets consist of those reported as trading securities and certain mortgage loans. Our liability for funds withheld and our asset for embedded derivatives included $1.2 billion and $44 million, respectively, as of September 30, 2009, related to the business sold to Swiss Re.  We sold a block of disability income business to Swiss Re as part of several indemnity reinsurance transactions executed in 2001, as discussed above. On January 24, 2009, an award of rescission was declared related to an ongoing dispute between us and Swiss Re for this treaty, which requires us to be fully responsible for all claims incurred and liabilities supporting this block as if the reinsurance treaty never existed. We are conducting a review of the adequacy of the reserves supporting the liabilities. We expect to evaluate the results of this review during our reporting for the fourth quarter of 2009. Any increase in reserves will result in a charge to our earnings. See Note 11 for a discussion of the effects of the rescission.  On March 31, 2009, we entered into a 55% coinsurance agreement whereby we ceded a closed block of business consisting of certain UL and VUL insurance products to a third party reinsurer. Effective October 1, 2009, we executed an additional agreement whereby we assumed the mortality risk on this block of business through yearly renewable term reinsurance. See “Results of Insurance Solutions – Insurance Solutions – Life Insurance” and “Review of Consolidated Financial Condition” for more information.  For factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in this section, see “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2008 Form 10-K and “Forward-Looking Statements – Cautionary Language” in this report.  REVIEW OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Sources of Liquidity and Cash Flow  Liquidity refers to the ability of an enterprise to generate adequate amounts of cash from its normal operations to meet cash requirements with a prudent margin of safety. Our principal sources of cash flow from operating activities are insurance premiums and fees and investment income, while sources of cash flows from investing activities result from maturities and sales of invested assets. Our operating activities provided cash of $552 million and $811 million for the first nine months of 2009 and 2008, respectively. When considering our liquidity and cash flow, it is important to distinguish between the needs of our insurance subsidiaries and the needs of the holding company, LNC. As a holding company with no operations of its own, LNC derives its cash primarily from its operating subsidiaries.  The sources of liquidity of the holding company are principally comprised of dividends and interest payments from subsidiaries, augmented by holding company short-term investments, bank lines of credit, a commercial paper program and the ongoing availability of long-term public financing under an SEC-filed shelf registration statement. These sources of liquidity and cash flow support the general corporate needs of the holding company, including its common and preferred stock dividends, interest and debt service, funding of callable securities, securities repurchases, repayment of preferred stock, acquisitions and investment in core businesses.       129          The disruptions in the capital markets experienced in the second half of 2008 continued into the first part of 2009. During this extraordinary market environment, management continually monitored and adjusted its liquidity and capital plans for LNC and its subsidiaries in light of changing needs and opportunities. To strengthen the capital position of our principal insurance subsidiaries and provide holding company liquidity during this period of volatility in the capital and credit markets, we issued common stock and debt during the second quarter of 2009 and issued preferred stock and a common stock warrant through the TARP CPP during the third quarter of 2009, which is discussed in more detail below in “Financing Activities.”  We believe that the rating agencies have heightened the level of scrutiny that they apply to the U.S. life insurance sector and may adjust upward the capital and other requirements employed in the rating agency models for maintenance of certain ratings levels. In addition, actions we take to access third party financing may in turn cause rating agencies to reevaluate our ratings. For more information about ratings, see “Part I – Item 1. Business – Ratings” in our 2008 Form 10-K.  Details underlying the primary sources of our holding company cash flows (in millions) were as follows:           For the Three       For the Nine       For the          Months Ended       Months Ended       Year Ended          September 30,       September 30,       December 31,          2009       2008       2009       2008       2008      Dividends from Subsidiaries                                  LNL, excluding Lincoln Financial Media    $ -     $ 100     $ 403     $ 400     $ 400     Lincoln Financial Media (1)      -       3       4       656       659     First Penn-Pacific      -       -       50       50       50     Delaware Investments      3       15       8       43       51     Lincoln Barbados      -       -       300       -       -     Lincoln UK      -       -       -       24       24     Other      -       -       -       -       54     Loan Repayments and Interest from                                             Subsidiary                                            LNL interest on intercompany notes (2)      22       22       63       63       83        $ 25     $ 140     $ 828     $ 1,236     $ 1,321     Other Cash Flow and Liquidity Items                                            Net proceeds on common stock issuance    $ -     $ -     $ 652     $ -     $ -     TARP CPP proceeds      950       -       950       -       -     Net capital received from (paid for taxes on) stock                                            option exercises and restricted stock      (1 )     1       (1 )     15       15        $ 949     $ 1     $ 1,601     $ 15     $ 15           (1)   For 2008, amount includes proceeds on the sale of certain discontinued media operations.        (2)   Primarily represents interest on the holding company’s $1.3 billion in surplus note investments in LNL.     The table above focuses on significant and recurring cash flow items and excludes the effects of certain financing activities, namely the periodic issuance and retirement of debt and cash flows related to our inter-company cash management program (discussed below). Taxes have been eliminated from the analysis due to a tax sharing agreement among our primary subsidiaries resulting in a modest impact on net cash flows at the holding company. Also excluded from this analysis is the modest amount of investment income on short-term investments of the holding company.       130          Dividends from Subsidiaries  Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to certain insurance department regulatory restrictions as to the transfer of funds and payment of dividends to the holding company. Under Indiana laws and regulations, our Indiana insurance subsidiaries, including our primary insurance subsidiary, LNL, may pay dividends to LNC without prior approval of the Indiana Insurance Commissioner (the “Commissioner”) up to a certain threshold, or must receive prior approval of the Commissioner to pay a dividend if such dividend, along with all other dividends paid within the preceding twelve consecutive months exceed the statutory limitation. The current statutory limitation is the greater of 10% of the insurer’s contract holders’ surplus, as shown on its last annual statement on file with the Commissioner or the insurer’s statutory net gain from operations for the prior calendar year. As discussed in “Part I – Item 1. Business – Regulatory – Insurance Regulation” in our 2008 Form 10-K, we may not consider the benefit from the permitted practice to the prescribed statutory accounting principles relating to our insurance subsidiaries’ deferred tax assets in calculating available dividends. Indiana law gives the Commissioner broad discretion to disapprove requests for dividends in excess of these limits. New York, the state of domicile of our other major insurance subsidiary, Lincoln Life & Annuity Co. of New York, has similar restrictions, except that in New York it is the lesser of 10% of surplus to contract holders as of the immediately preceding calendar year or net gain from operations for the immediately preceding calendar year, not including realized capital gains.  We expect our domestic insurance subsidiaries could pay dividends of approximately $550 million in 2009 without prior approval from the respective state commissioners. The amount of surplus that our insurance subsidiaries could pay as dividends is constrained by the amount of surplus we hold to maintain our ratings, to provide an additional layer of margin for risk protection and for future investment in our businesses.  We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types and maturities. These investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks. An extended disruption in the credit and capital markets could adversely affect LNC and its subsidiaries’ ability to access sources of liquidity, and there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available to us on favorable terms, or at all, in the current market environment. In addition, further other-than-temporary impairments could reduce our statutory surplus, leading to lower RBC ratios and potentially reducing future dividend capacity from our insurance subsidiaries.  Subsidiaries’ Statutory Reserving and Surplus  Our insurance subsidiaries have statutory surplus and RBC levels above current regulatory required levels. As mentioned earlier in “Results of Insurance Solutions – Insurance Solutions – Life Insurance,” approximately 58% and 66% of our life sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2009, respectively, consisted of products containing secondary guarantees, which require reserving practices under AG38. Our insurance subsidiaries are employing strategies to lessen the burden of increased AG38 and Valuation of Life Insurance Policies Model Regulation (“XXX”) statutory reserves associated with certain UL products and other products with secondary guarantees subject to these statutory reserving requirements.  Included in the letters of credit (“LOCs”) issued as of September 30, 2009, reported in the revolving credit facilities table below in “Financing Activities,” was approximately $1.5 billion of LOCs supporting the reinsurance obligations of Lincoln National Reinsurance Company (Barbados) Limited (“LNBAR”) on UL business with secondary guarantees. Recognizing that LOCs are generally one to five years in duration, it is likely that our insurance companies will apply a mix of LOCs, reinsurance and capital market strategies in addressing long-term AG38 and XXX needs. LOCs and related capital market alternatives lower the RBC impact of the UL business with secondary guarantee products. An inability to obtain the necessary LOC capacity or other capital market alternatives could impact our returns on UL business with secondary guarantee products. Our strategy to address the statutory reserve strain from UL products with secondary guarantees uses a mix of retaining a portion of the statutory reserve strain, implementing long-term capital financing solutions and leveraging short-term LOCs. We previously executed a long-term structured solution of approximately $400 million in 2007. It is our plan to replace the $1.5 billion of LOCs that mature in 2012 with a mix of more permanent long-term structures and new LOCs.  We are continuing to pursue capital management strategies related to our AG38 reserves involving reinsurance and securitizations. As mentioned above in “Reinsurance,” we entered into a coinsurance agreement on March 31, 2009. The transaction resulted in the release of approximately $240 million of statutory capital previously supporting a closed block of business of certain UL and VUL insurance products and an RBC benefit of approximately 20 percentage points in 2009. Effective October 1, 2009, we executed an additional agreement whereby we assumed the mortality risk on this block of business, which resulted in a capital outlay of approximately $14 million. See “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors – Attempts to mitigate the impact of Regulation XXX and Actuarial Guideline 38 may fail in whole or in part resulting in an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations” in our 2008 Form 10-K for further information on XXX reserves. In addition, a portion of our term life insurance business is reinsured with a domestic reinsurance captive as part of our overall strategy of managing the statutory capital of our insurance subsidiaries. There are no outstanding LOCs related to this business.       131          As a result of recent financing activities discussed below and upon the closing of the TARP CPP, we contributed $1.0 billion to our principal life insurance subsidiary during the third quarter of 2009. In addition, we contributed media assets to our principal life insurance subsidiary during the second quarter of 2009, which increased our statutory capital by $285 million.  In September of 2008, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners adopted a new statutory reserving standard, VACARVM, which will be effective as of December 31, 2009. We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of adopting VACARVM. This reserving requirement will replace current statutory reserving practices for variable annuities with guaranteed benefits and has the potential to require statutory reserves well in excess of current levels for certain variable annuity riders sold by us. The actual impact of the adoption will be dependent upon several factors including account values and market conditions that exist as of December 31, 2009, the value of derivative and other assets supporting reserves whose change in value may be uncorrelated with the new reserving requirements and the use of captive or third-party reinsurance. Our current capital plan assumes a $500 million impact related to VACARVM, recognizing that this is a preliminary estimate, and contemplates actions to better manage the capital requirements as we move towards implementation. Markets will greatly influence the ultimate capital required due to their impact on the valuation of reserves and derivative assets hedging these reserves. We continue to evaluate the impact of VACARVM requirements on our capital position and reserving assumptions. Our estimates of the expected impact may change as we conduct further analysis prior to implementation. We are analyzing the current use of existing captive reinsurance structures, as well as additional third-party reinsurance arrangements, and hedging strategies relative to managing the negative impact on the level and volatility of statutory capital and dividend capacity in our life insurance subsidiaries. Depending on market conditions, reinsurance solutions and hedging strategies, additional statutory reserves could lead to lower RBC ratios and potentially reduce future dividend capacity of our insurance subsidiaries.  As a result of the equity market impacts in the third quarter of 2009, we experienced an increase in the statutory reserve adjustment under the Commissioners Annuity Reserve Valuation Method (“CARVM”) for our annuity products and lower net reserves for GDB riders. CARVM is the current statutory actuarial method used for determining reserves for the base annuity contract. The impact of these items increased statutory surplus of our statutory insurance companies by approximately $100 million in the third quarter of 2009. We estimate that an S&P 500 level of 900, a 15% drop from the September 30, 2009, level, would result in a decrease in the CARVM statutory reserve adjustment and an increase in statutory net GDB reserves, and thereby, reduce statutory surplus of LNL by $80 million to $100 million at the end of 2009. As a result, the estimated RBC ratio on a consolidated basis as of December 31, 2009, under this scenario would be reduced by approximately five to seven percentage points. The estimated capital impact is based on the current statutory reserve formulas and does not take into account the reserve and asset adequacy analysis performed by our actuaries on an annual basis to determine appropriateness of the reserves at year end. This analysis incorporates the adequacy of assets in LNBAR, our captive reinsurance company, supporting the liabilities that it assumes from LNL. The outcome of this analysis may result in an additional reserve increase and could further reduce the RBC ratio.   The sensitivity of our statutory reserves and surplus established for our variable annuity base contracts and riders to changes in the equity markets will vary depending on the magnitude of the decline. The sensitivity will be affected by the level of account values relative to the level of guaranteed amounts, product design and reinsurance. Statutory reserves for variable annuities depend upon the cumulative equity market impacts on the business in force and therefore result in non-linear relationships with respect to the level of equity market performance within any reporting period. The RBC ratio is also affected by the product mix of the in-force book of business (i.e., the amount of business without guarantees is not subject to the same level of reserves as the business with guarantees). The RBC ratio of LNL is an important factor in the determination of the credit and financial strength ratings of LNC and its subsidiaries. The market value of our separate account assets increased during the first nine months of 2009, resulting in a $95 million increase in statutory surplus. The separate accounts include the impact of our variable annuities and also our credit-linked notes. However, future declines in the market values of our separate account assets could cause reductions in the surplus of LNL, which may impact its RBC ratio and dividend capacity.   Financing Activities  Although our subsidiaries currently generate adequate cash flow to meet the needs of our normal operations, periodically we may issue debt or equity securities to maintain ratings and increase liquidity, as well as to fund internal growth, acquisitions and the retirement of our debt and equity securities.  We currently have an effective shelf registration statement, which allows us to issue, in unlimited amounts, securities, including debt securities, preferred stock, common stock, warrants, stock purchase contracts, stock purchase units, depository shares and trust preferred securities of our affiliated trusts.  We entered into a purchase agreement to sell Delaware on August 18, 2009. We expect this transaction to close on or around December 31, 2009, and we expect that the after-tax proceeds of approximately $400 million will be used for general corporate purposes.       132          On July 10, 2009, we issued and sold to the U.S. Treasury 950,000 shares of Series B preferred stock together with a related warrant to purchase up to 13,049,451 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $10.92 per share, in accordance with the terms of the TARP CPP, for an aggregate purchase price of $950 million. Holders of this Series B preferred stock are entitled to a cumulative cash dividend at the annual rate per share of 5% of the liquidation preference, $1,000 per share, or $48 million annually, for the first five years from issuance. After July 10, 2014, if the preferred shares are still outstanding, the annual dividend rate will increase to 9% per year. We intend to repay this financing prior to the increase in the dividend rate, taking into consideration appropriate balance sheet strength and capital market conditions. The Series B non-voting preferred stock has no maturity date and ranks senior to our common stock. The Series B preferred stock dividends and related accretion of discount is recorded as a direct reduction to retained earnings and deducted from income available to common stockholders in the calculation of earnings per share. See Note 12 for additional details.  On June 22, 2009, we closed on the issuance and sale of 40 million shares of our common stock at a price to the public of $15.00 per share, and we also completed the issuance and sale of $500 million aggregate principal amount of our 8.75% senior notes due 2019. On June 25, 2009, we closed on the issuance and sale of 6 million additional shares of our common stock at a price of $15.00 per share to the underwriters who exercised their over-allotment option. The net proceeds from these offerings were approximately $1.1 billion.  As mentioned above, we contributed $1.0 billion of the proceeds of these recent financing activities to our principal insurance subsidiary during the third quarter of 2009, and we retained the remaining $1.1 billion at the holding company for general corporate purposes.  We announced on June 15, 2009, that we entered into a share purchase agreement to sell Lincoln UK. The transaction closed on October 1, 2009, and we received proceeds of approximately $305 million, after-tax, that will be used for general corporate purposes. There could be post-closing adjustments, some of which are beyond our control, and no assurance can be given as to the timing of its completion as an extension beyond 120 days is allowed in the share purchase agreement if there is disagreement during this period.  Details underlying debt and financing activities (in millions) were as follows:           For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2009                            Change                                  Maturities       in Fair                      Beginning             and       Value       Other       Ending          Balance       Issuance       Repayments       Hedges       Changes (1)       Balance      Short-Term Debt                                        Commercial paper    $ 315     $ -     $ -     $ -     $ (166 )   $ 149     Current maturities of long-term debt      500       -       (500 )     -       250       250     Other short-term debt      -       -       -       -       1       1     Total short-term debt    $ 815     $ -     $ (500 )   $ -     $ 85     $ 400                                                        Long-Term Debt                                                    Senior notes    $ 2,555     $ 495     $ -     $ (104 )   $ (247 )   $ 2,699     Bank borrowing      200       -       -       -       -       200     Federal Home Loan Bank                                                    of Indianapolis ("FHLBI") advance      250       -       -       -       -       250     Junior subordinated debentures                                                    issued to affiliated trusts      155       -       -       -       -       155     Capital securities      1,571       -       (87 )     -       1       1,485     Total long-term debt    $ 4,731     $ 495     $ (87 )   $ (104 )   $ (246 )   $ 4,789           (1)   Includes the net increase (decrease) in commercial paper, non-cash reclassification of long-term debt to current maturities of long-term debt, accretion of discounts and (amortization) of premiums.          133          On April 6, 2009, we funded the maturity of a $500 million floating rate senior note through dividends received during the second quarter of 2009 from LNL and LNBAR and internal borrowings. Borrowings that are scheduled to mature within two years include a $250 million floating rate senior note due on March 12, 2010, and a $250 million 6.2% fixed rate senior note due on December 15, 2011. We are currently considering refinancing alternatives to, among other things, pre-fund the debt maturing in March 2010. The specific resources or combination of resources that we will use to meet the maturities will depend upon, among other things, the financial market conditions present at the time of maturity. As of September 30, 2009, the holding company had $820 million in cash and cash equivalents.  In March of 2009, we repurchased $87 million of our capital securities and recognized a gain of $64 million, pre-tax. See Note 10 for additional information on the gain recognized on the early extinguishment of debt.  Details underlying our credit facilities with a group of domestic and foreign banks (in millions) were as follows:             As of September 30, 2009        Expiration     Maximum       Borrowings        Date     Available       Outstanding      Revolving Credit Facilities                  Credit facility with the FHLBI (1)   Not Applicable    $ 411     $ 350     Five-year revolving credit facility   March 2011      1,750       -     Five-year revolving credit facility   February 2011      1,350       -     Total      $ 3,511     $ 350                          Letters of credit issued              $ 2,095           (1)   Our borrowing capacity under this credit facility does not have an expiration date and continues while our investment in the FHLBI common stock remains outstanding as long as LNL maintains a satisfactory level of creditworthiness and does not incur a material adverse change in its financial, business, regulatory or other areas that would materially affect its operations and viability. Of the borrowings outstanding as of September 30, 2009, $250 million is classified within long-term debt and $100 million is classified within payables for collateral under securities loaned and derivatives on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The maturity dates of the borrowings are discussed below.     The LOCs support inter-company reinsurance transactions and specific treaties associated with our business sold through reinsurance. LOCs are used primarily to satisfy the U.S. regulatory requirements of our domestic insurance companies for which reserve credit is provided by our affiliated offshore reinsurance company, as discussed above, and our domestic clients of the business sold through reinsurance.  Under the credit agreements, we must maintain a minimum consolidated net worth level. In addition, the agreements contain covenants restricting our ability to incur liens, merge or consolidate with another entity where we are not the surviving entity and dispose of all or substantially all of our assets. As of September 30, 2009, we were in compliance with all such covenants. All of our credit agreements are unsecured.  If current debt ratings and claims-paying ratings were downgraded in the future, terms in our derivative agreements may be triggered, which could negatively impact overall liquidity. For the majority of our counterparties, there is a termination event should long-term debt ratings of LNC drop below BBB-/Baa3. Our long-term debt currently holds a rating of BBB/Baa2. In addition, contractual selling agreements with intermediaries could be negatively impacted, which could have an adverse impact on overall sales of annuities, life insurance and investment products. See “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors – A decrease in the capital and surplus of our insurance subsidiaries may result in a downgrade to our insurer financial strength ratings” and “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors – A downgrade in our financial strength or credit ratings could limit our ability to market products, increase the number or value of policies being surrendered and/or hurt our relationships with creditors” in our 2008 Form 10-K for more information. See “Part I – Item 1. Business – Ratings” in our 2008 Form 10-K for additional information on our current bond ratings.       134          In the third quarter of 2008, LNL made an investment of $19 million in the FHLBI, a AAA-rated entity, and made an additional investment of $2 million in the second quarter of 2009. We are allowed to borrow up to 20 times the amount of our common stock investment in the FHLBI. All borrowings from the FHLBI are required to be secured by certain investments owned by LNL. On December 4, 2008, the LNC and LNL Boards of Directors approved an additional common stock investment of $56 million, which would increase our total borrowing capacity up to $1.5 billion upon completion of that incremental investment. As of September 30, 2009, based on our actual common stock investment, we had borrowing capacity of up to approximately $411 million from the FHLBI. We had a $250 million floating-rate term loan outstanding under the facility due June 20, 2017, which may be prepaid beginning June 20, 2010. In June 2009, we also borrowed $100 million at a rate of 0.8% that is due June 3, 2010.   Management is monitoring the covenants associated with LNC’s capital securities. If we fail to meet capital adequacy or net income and shareholders’ equity levels (also referred to as “trigger events”), terms in the agreements may be triggered, which would require us to make interest payments in accordance with an alternative coupon satisfaction mechanism (“ACSM”).  The ACSM would require us to use commercially reasonable efforts to pay interest in full on the capital securities with the net proceeds from sales of our common stock and warrants on our common stock with an exercise price greater than the market price. We would have to utilize the ACSM until the trigger events above no longer existed. If we were required to utilize the ACSM and were successful in selling sufficient common shares or warrants to satisfy the interest payment, we would dilute the current holders of our common stock. Furthermore, while a trigger event is occurring and if we do not pay accrued interest in full, we may not, among other things, pay dividends on or repurchase our capital stock. We have designated the proceeds from our June 2009 common stock offering as being available to satisfy the ACSM; therefore, the proceeds can be used for such purpose for 180 days after June 22, 2009.  In recent quarters, we have triggered the net income test as a result of quarterly consolidated net losses, and we may continue to trigger the net income test looking forward to future quarters. However, our capital raise in the form of equity in the second and third quarters of 2009 resulted in avoiding the overall shareholders’ equity trigger looking forward to the quarters ending December 31, 2009, and March 31, 2010.  For more information, see “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors – We will be required to pay interest on our capital securities with proceeds from the issuance of qualifying securities if we fail to achieve capital adequacy or net income and shareholders’ equity levels” and Note 13 in our 2008 Form 10-K.  Alternative Sources of Liquidity   In order to manage our capital more efficiently, we have an inter-company cash management program where certain subsidiaries can lend to or borrow from the holding company to meet short-term borrowing needs. The cash management program is essentially a series of demand loans, which are permitted under applicable insurance laws, among LNC and its affiliates that reduces overall borrowing costs by allowing LNC and its subsidiaries to access internal resources instead of incurring third-party transaction costs. For our Indiana-domiciled insurance subsidiaries, the borrowing and lending limit is currently the lesser of 3% of the insurance company’s admitted assets and 25% of its surplus, in both cases, as of its most recent year end.  The holding company did not borrow from the cash management program during the third quarter of 2009, and there was no balance as of September 30, 2009. In addition, the holding company had an outstanding payable of $130 million to certain subsidiaries resulting from amounts placed by the subsidiaries in the inter-company cash management account in excess of funds borrowed by those subsidiaries as of September 30, 2009. Any increase (decrease) in either of these holding company cash management program payable balances results in an immediate and equal increase (decrease) to holding company cash and cash equivalents.  Our insurance subsidiaries, by virtue of their general account fixed income investment holdings, can access liquidity through securities lending programs and repurchase agreements. As of September 30, 2009, our insurance subsidiaries had securities with a carrying value of $694 million out on loan under the securities lending program and $344 million carrying value subject to reverse-repurchase agreements. The cash received in our securities lending program is typically invested in cash equivalents, short-term investments or fixed maturity securities.  LNC has a $1.0 billion commercial paper program that is rated A-2, P-2 and F2. The commercial paper program is backed by a bank line of credit. During the third quarter of 2009, LNC had an average of $191 million in commercial paper outstanding with a maximum amount of $220 million outstanding at any time. LNC had $149 million of commercial paper outstanding as of September 30, 2009.  For factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in this section, see “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2008 Form 10-K and “Forward-Looking Statements – Cautionary Language” in this report.       135          Divestitures  For a discussion of our divestitures, see Note 3.  Uses of Capital  Our principal uses of cash are to pay policy claims and benefits, operating expenses, commissions and taxes, to purchase new investments, to purchase reinsurance, to fund policy surrenders and withdrawals, to pay dividends to our stockholders and to repurchase our stock and debt securities.  Return of Capital to Common Stockholders   One of the holding company’s primary goals is to provide a return to our common stockholders through dividends and stock repurchases. In determining dividends, the Board takes into consideration items such as current and expected earnings, capital needs, rating agency considerations and requirements for financial flexibility. As a result of our participation in the TARP CPP, we are subject to limits on increasing the dividend on our common stock (unless the U.S. Treasury consents), which applies until the third anniversary of the U.S. Treasury’s investment unless we redeem the Series B preferred shares in whole or the U.S. Treasury transfers all of the Series B preferred stock to third parties.    Details underlying this activity (in millions, except per share data) were as follows:             For the Three             For the Nine             For the          Months Ended             Months Ended             Year Ended          September 30,             September 30,             December 31,          2009       2008       Change       2009       2008       Change       2008      Common dividends to stockholders    $ 3     $ 106       -97 %   $ 59     $ 323       -82 %   $ 429     Repurchase of common stock      -       50       -100 %     -       476       -100 %     476     Total cash returned to                                                            stockholders    $ 3     $ 156       -98 %   $ 59     $ 799       -93 %   $ 905                                                                Number of shares issued      -       -      NM        46.000       -      NM        -     Average price per share    $ -     $ -      NM      $ 14.34     $ -      NM      $ -                                                                Number of shares repurchased      -       1.010       -100 %     -       9.091       -100 %     9.091     Average price per share    $ -     $ 49.55       -100 %   $ -     $ 52.31       -100 %   $ 52.31       Note: Average price per share is calculated using whole dollars instead of dollars rounded to millions.  On February 24, 2009, the Board of Directors approved a reduction of the dividend on our common stock from $0.21 to $0.01 per share, which, along with a prior reduction, is expected to add approximately $100 million to capital each quarter. Additionally, we have suspended stock repurchase activity. We expect that both of these changes will favorably impact our capital position prospectively in light of the recent market volatility and extraordinary events and developments affecting financial markets.  Significant Trends in Sources and Uses of Cash Flow  As stated above, LNC’s cash flow, as a holding company, is largely dependent upon the dividend capacity of its insurance company subsidiaries as well as their ability to advance funds to it through inter-company borrowing arrangements, which may be impacted by factors influencing the insurance subsidiaries’ RBC and statutory earnings performance. As a result of the raising of $2.1 billion as part of our capital plan, discussed in “Financing Activities” above, we currently expect to be able to meet the holding company’s ongoing cash needs and to have sufficient capital to offer downside protection in the event that the capital and credit markets experience another period of extreme volatility and disruption. These actions compliment the previously mentioned dividend reductions, suspension of share repurchases and enterprise-wide restructuring program that is expected to generate $250 million, pre-tax, in annual savings to further strengthen our capital and liquidity positions. In addition, we are exploring our options with regard to protecting and building capital at the insurance company subsidiaries, which may include, depending on then current market conditions and other factors, potential securitizations of reserves, reinsurance transactions and sales of corporate assets. Note, a continuation of or an acceleration of poor capital market conditions, which reduces our insurance subsidiaries’ statutory surplus and RBC, may require them to retain more capital and may pressure our subsidiaries’ dividends to the holding company, which may lead us to take steps to preserve or raise additional capital. For factors that could affect our expectations for liquidity and capital, see “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2008 Form 10-K.       136          OTHER MATTERS  Other Factors Affecting Our Business   In general, our businesses are subject to a changing social, economic, legal, legislative and regulatory environment. Some of the changes include initiatives to require more reserves to be carried by our insurance subsidiaries. Although the eventual effect on us of the changing environment in which we operate remains uncertain, these factors and others could have a material effect on our results of operations, liquidity and capital resources. For factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in this section, see “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2008 Form 10-K, as updated in “Forward-Looking Statements – Cautionary Language” in this report.  Recent Accounting Pronouncements  See Note 2 for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements that have been implemented during the periods presented or that have been issued and are to be implemented in the future.  Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  We analyze and manage the risks arising from market exposures of financial instruments, as well as other risks, in an integrated asset-liability management process that takes diversification into account. By aggregating the potential effect of market and other risks on the entire enterprise, we estimate, review and in some cases manage the risk to our earnings and shareholder value. We have exposures to several market risks including interest rate, foreign currency exchange, equity market, default, basis and credit. The exposure of financial instruments to market risks, and the related risk management process, are most important to our Retirement Solutions and Insurance Solutions businesses, where most of the invested assets support accumulation and investment-oriented insurance products. As an important element of our integrated asset-liability management process, we use derivatives to minimize the effects of changes in interest levels, the shape of the yield curve, currency movements and volatility. In this context, derivatives are designated as a hedge and serve to minimize interest rate risk by mitigating the effect of significant increases in interest rates on our earnings. Additional market exposures exist in our other general account insurance products and in our debt structure and derivatives positions. Our primary sources of market risk are: substantial, relatively rapid and sustained increases or decreases in interest rates; fluctuations in currency exchange rates; or a sharp drop in equity market values. These market risks are discussed in detail in the following pages and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements (“Notes”) presented in “Item 1. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” as well as “Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”).  Derivatives  We have entered into derivative transactions to hedge our exposure to rapid changes in interest rates. The derivative programs are used to help us achieve somewhat stable margins while providing competitive crediting rates to contract holders during periods when interest rates are changing. Such derivatives include interest rate swaps, interest rate futures, interest rate caps and treasury locks. See Note 6 for additional information on our derivatives used to hedge our exposure to changes in interest rates.  In addition to continuing existing programs, we may use derivative instruments in other strategies to limit risk and enhance returns, particularly in the management of investment spread businesses. We have established policies, guidelines and internal control procedures for the use of derivatives as tools to enhance management of the overall portfolio of risks assumed in our operations. Annually, our Board of Directors reviews our derivatives policy.       137          Impact of Equity Market Sensitivity  Due to the use of our reversion to the mean (“RTM”) process and our hedging strategies as described in “MD&A – Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” in Item 2 above and in Item 7 of our 2008 Form 10-K, we expect that, in general, short-term fluctuations in the equity markets should not have a significant impact on our quarterly earnings from unlocking of assumptions for deferred acquisition costs, value of business acquired, deferred sales inducements and deferred front-end loads, as we do not unlock our long-term equity market assumptions based upon short-term fluctuations in the equity markets. However, there is an impact to earnings from the effects of equity market movements on account values and assets under management and the related asset-based fees we earn on those assets net of related expenses we incur based upon the level of assets. The following table presents our estimate of the impact on income from operations (in millions), from the change in asset-based fees and related expenses, if the level of the S&P 500 Index® (“S&P 500”) were to drop to 800 immediately after September 30, 2009, and remaining at that level through the next twelve months or dropped to 700 immediately after September 30, 2009, and remain at that level through the next twelve months, excluding any impact related to sales, prospective unlocking, persistency, hedge program performance or customer behavior caused by the equity market change:           S&P 500       S&P 500          at 700 (2)       at 800 (2)      Segment                Retirement Solutions – Annuities (1)    $ (110 )   $ (80 )   Retirement Solutions – Defined Contribution (1)      (25 )     (20 )         (1)   If the level of the S&P 500 dropped to 700 immediately after September 30, 2009, and remained at that level in subsequent periods we project that we would have a RTM prospective unlocking of approximately $250 million to $310 million, after-tax, for Retirement Solutions late in 2011. If the level of the S&P 500 dropped to 800 immediately after September 30, 2009, and remained at that level in subsequent periods we project that we would have a RTM prospective unlocking of approximately $200 million to $240 million, after-tax, for Retirement Solutions late in 2012.        (2)   The baseline for these impacts assumes 9% annual equity market growth beginning on October 1, 2009. The baseline is then compared to scenarios of S&P 500 at the 700 and 800 levels, which assume the index stays at those levels for the next twelve months and grows at 9% annually thereafter. The difference between the baseline and S&P 500 at the 700 and 800 level scenarios is presented in the table.     The impact on earnings summarized above is an expected effect for the next twelve months. The effect of quarterly equity market changes upon fee revenues and asset-based expenses will not be fully recognized in the current quarter because fee revenues are earned and related expenses are incurred based upon daily variable account values. The difference between the current period average daily variable account values compared to the end of period variable account values impacts fee revenues in subsequent periods. Additionally, the impact on earnings may not necessarily be symmetrical with comparable increases in the equity markets. This discussion concerning the estimated effects of ongoing equity market volatility on the fees we earn from account values and assets under management is intended to be illustrative. Actual effects may vary depending on a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control, such as changing customer behaviors that might result in changes in the mix of our business between variable and fixed annuity contracts, switching among investment alternatives available within variable products, changes in sales production levels or changes in policy persistency. For purposes of this guidance, the change in account values is assumed to correlate with the change in the relevant index.  Credit-Related Derivatives  We use credit-related derivatives to minimize our exposure to credit-related events and we also sell credit default swaps to offer credit protection to our contract holders. For additional information see Note 6.       138          Credit Risk   Through the use of derivative instruments, we are exposed to both credit risk (our counterparty fails to make payment) and market risk (the value of the instrument falls). When the fair value of a derivative contract is positive, this generally indicates that the counterparty owes us and, therefore, creates a credit risk for us equal to the extent of the fair value gain in the derivative. When the fair value of a derivative contract is negative, this generally indicates we owe the counterparty and therefore we have no credit risk, but have been affected by market risk. We minimize the credit risk in derivative instruments by entering into transactions with high quality counterparties with minimum credit ratings that are reviewed regularly by us, by limiting the amount of credit exposure to any one counterparty, and by requiring certain counterparties to post collateral if our credit risk exceeds certain limits. We also maintain a policy of requiring all derivative contracts to be governed by an International Swaps and Derivatives Association (“ISDA”) Master Agreement. We do not believe that the credit or market risks associated with derivative instruments are material to any insurance subsidiary or to us.  We have derivative positions with counterparties. Assuming zero recovery value, our exposure is the positive market value of the derivative positions with a counterparty, less collateral, that would be lost if the counterparty were to default. As of September 30, 2009, and December 31, 2008, our counterparty risk exposure, net of collateral, was $426 million and $562 million, respectively. Of this exposure, $144 million and $145 million, respectively was related to our program to hedge our variable annuity guaranteed benefits. As of September 30, 2009, we have exposure to 16 counterparties, with a maximum exposure of $148 million, net of collateral, to a single counterparty. The credit risk associated with such agreements is minimized by purchasing such agreements from financial institutions with long-standing, superior performance records. For the majority of Lincoln National Corporation (“LNC”) counterparties, there is a termination event should long-term debt ratings of LNC rating drop below BBB-/Baa3. Additionally, we maintain a policy of requiring all derivative contracts to be governed by an ISDA Master Agreement.  As of September 30, 2009, and December 31, 2008, our fair value of counterparty exposure (in millions) was as follows:             As of       As of            September 30,       December 31,            2009       2008      Rating                  AAA      $ 4     $ 20     AA        290       333    A         125       209     BBB        7       -     Total      $ 426     $ 562       Item 4. Controls and Procedures  Conclusions Regarding Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, which are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As of the end of the period covered by this report, we, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as that term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting them to material information relating to us and our consolidated subsidiaries required to be disclosed in our periodic reports under the Exchange Act.       139          Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as that term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2009, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the company have been detected. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.       140          PART II – OTHER INFORMATION  Item 1.
