Item 1A. Risk Factors,” “Part II – Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and “Part II – Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data”; our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q filed in 2011; and our current reports on Form 8-K filed in 2011.   In this report, in addition to providing consolidated revenues and net income (loss), we also provide segment operating revenues and income (loss) from operations because we believe they are meaningful measures of revenues and the profitability of our operating segments. Income (loss) from operations is net income recorded in accordance with United States of America generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) excluding the after-tax effects of the following items, as applicable:       ·    Realized gains and losses associated with the following (“excluded realized gain (loss)”):        §    Sales or disposals of securities;        §    Impairments of securities;        §    Change in the fair value of derivative investments, embedded derivatives within certain reinsurance arrangements and our trading securities;        §    Change in the fair value of the derivatives we own to hedge our guaranteed death benefit (“GDB”) riders within our variable annuities, which is referred to as “GDB derivatives results”;        §    Change in the fair value of the embedded derivatives of our guaranteed living benefit (“GLB”) riders within our variable annuities accounted for under the Derivatives and Hedging and the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topics of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards CodificationTM (“ASC”) (“embedded derivative reserves”), net of the change in the fair value of the derivatives we own to hedge the changes in the embedded derivative reserves, the net of which is referred to as “GLB net derivative results”; and        §    Changes in the fair value of the embedded derivative liabilities related to index call options we may purchase in the future to hedge contract holder index allocations applicable to future reset periods for our indexed annuity products accounted for under the Derivatives and Hedging and the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topics of the FASB ASC (“indexed annuity forward-starting option”);        ·    Change in reserves accounted for under the Financial Services – Insurance – Claim Costs and Liabilities for Future Policy Benefits Subtopic of the FASB ASC resulting from benefit ratio unlocking on our GDB and GLB riders (“benefit ratio unlocking”);        ·    Income (loss) from the initial adoption of new accounting standards;        ·    Income (loss) from reserve changes (net of related amortization) on business sold through reinsurance;        ·    Gain (loss) on early extinguishment of debt;        ·    Losses from the impairment of intangible assets; and        ·    Income (loss) from discontinued operations.      Income (loss) from operations available to common stockholders is net income (loss) available to common stockholders (used in the calculation of earnings (loss) per share) in accordance with GAAP, excluding the after-tax effects of the items above and the acceleration of our Series B preferred stock discount as a result of redemption prior to five years from the date of issuance.   Operating revenues represent GAAP revenues excluding the pre-tax effects of the following items, as applicable:       ·    Excluded realized gain (loss);        ·    Amortization of deferred front-end loads (“DFEL”) arising from changes in GDB and GLB benefit ratio unlocking;        ·    Amortization of deferred gains arising from the reserve changes on business sold through reinsurance; and        ·    Revenue adjustments from the initial adoption of new accounting standards.      Operating revenues and income (loss) from operations are the financial performance measures we use to evaluate and assess the results of our segments. Accordingly, we report operating revenues and income (loss) from operations by segment in Note 14. Our management believes that operating revenues and income (loss) from operations explain the results of our ongoing businesses in a manner that allows for a better understanding of the underlying trends in our current businesses because the excluded items are unpredictable and not necessarily indicative of current operating fundamentals or future performance of the business segments, and, in many instances, decisions regarding these items do not necessarily relate to the operations of the individual segments. In        54           addition, we believe that our definitions of operating revenues and income (loss) from operations will provide investors with a more valuable measure of our performance because it better reveals trends in our business.   We use our prevailing corporate federal income tax rate of 35% while taking into account any permanent differences for events recognized differently in our financial statements and federal income tax returns when reconciling our non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measure. Operating revenues and income (loss) from operations do not replace revenues and net income as the GAAP measures of our consolidated results of operations.   Certain reclassifications have been made to prior periods’ financial information.   FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS – CAUTIONARY LANGUAGE   Certain statements made in this report and in other written or oral statements made by us or on our behalf are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (“PSLRA”).

In particular, these include statements relating to future actions, trends in our businesses, prospective services or products, future performance or financial results and the outcome of contingencies, such as legal proceedings. We claim the protection afforded by the safe harbor for forward-looking statements provided by the PSLRA.   Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from the results contained in the forward-looking statements. Risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to vary materially, some of which are described within the forward-looking statements, include, among others:       ·    Deterioration in general economic and business conditions that may affect account values, investment results, guaranteed benefit liabilities, premium levels, claims experience and the level of pension benefit costs, funding and investment results;        ·    Adverse capital and credit market conditions could cause us to realize impairments on investments and certain intangible assets, including goodwill and a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets, which may reduce future earnings and/or affect our financial condition and ability to raise additional capital or refinance existing debt as it matures;        ·    Because of our holding company structure, the inability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends to the holding company in sufficient amounts could harm the holding company’s ability to meet its obligations;        ·    Legislative, regulatory or tax changes, both domestic and foreign, that affect the cost of, or demand for, our subsidiaries’ products, the required amount of reserves and/or surplus, or otherwise affect our ability to conduct business, including changes to statutory reserves and/or risk-based capital (“RBC”) requirements related to secondary guarantees under universal life and variable annuity products such as Actuarial Guideline 43 (also known as Commissioners Annuity Reserve Valuation Method for Variable Annuities or VACARVM); restrictions on revenue sharing and 12b-1 payments; and the potential for U.S. Federal tax reform;        ·    Uncertainty about the effect of rules and regulations to be promulgated under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act on us and the economy and the financial services sector in particular;        ·    The initiation of legal or regulatory proceedings against us, and the outcome of any legal or regulatory proceedings, such as: adverse actions related to present or past business practices common in businesses in which we compete; adverse decisions in significant actions including, but not limited to, actions brought by federal and state authorities and extra-contractual and class action cases; new decisions that result in changes in law; and unexpected trial court rulings;        ·    Changes in or sustained low interest rates causing reductions of investment income, estimated gross profits relating to our variable annuity and universal life products, the margins of our subsidiaries’ fixed annuity and life insurance businesses and demand for their products;        ·    A decline in the equity markets causing a reduction in the sales of our subsidiaries’ products, a reduction of asset-based fees that our subsidiaries charge on various investment and insurance products, an acceleration of amortization of deferred acquisition costs (“DAC”), value of business acquired (“VOBA”), deferred sales inducements (“DSI”) and DFEL and an increase in liabilities related to guaranteed benefit features of our subsidiaries’ variable annuity products;        ·    Ineffectiveness of our various hedging strategies used to offset the effect of changes in the value of liabilities due to changes in the level and volatility of the equity markets and interest rates;        ·    A deviation in actual experience regarding future persistency, mortality, morbidity, interest rates or equity market returns from the assumptions used in pricing our subsidiaries’ products, in establishing related insurance reserves and in the amortization of DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL, which may reduce future earnings;        ·    Changes in GAAP, including convergence with International Financial Reporting Standards, as well as the methodologies, estimations and assumptions thereunder, that may result in unanticipated changes to our net income;        ·    Lowering of one or more of our debt ratings issued by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations and the adverse effect such action may have on our ability to raise capital and on our liquidity and financial condition;           55                 ·    Lowering of one or more of the insurer financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries and the adverse effect such action may have on the premium writings, policy retention, profitability of our insurance subsidiaries and liquidity;        ·    Significant credit, accounting, fraud or corporate governance issues that may adversely affect the value of certain investments in our portfolios requiring that we realize losses on such investments;        ·    The effect of acquisitions and divestitures, restructurings, product withdrawals and other unusual items, including our ability to integrate acquisitions and to obtain the anticipated results and synergies from acquisitions;        ·    The adequacy and collectibility of reinsurance that we have purchased;        ·    Acts of terrorism, a pandemic, war or other man-made and natural catastrophes that may adversely affect our businesses and the cost and availability of reinsurance;        ·    Competitive conditions, including pricing pressures, new product offerings and the emergence of new competitors, that may affect the level of premiums and fees that our subsidiaries can charge for their products;        ·    The unknown effect on our subsidiaries’ businesses resulting from changes in the demographics of their client base, as aging baby-boomers move from the asset-accumulation stage to the asset-distribution stage of life; and        ·    Loss of key management, financial planners or wholesalers.      The risks included here are not exhaustive. Our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and other documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) include additional factors that could affect our business and financial performance. Moreover, we operate in a rapidly changing and competitive environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors.   Further, it is not possible to assess the effect of all risk factors on our businesses or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results. In addition, we disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that occur after the date of this report.   INTRODUCTION   Executive Summary   We are a holding company that operates multiple insurance and retirement businesses through subsidiary companies. Through our business segments, we sell a wide range of wealth protection, accumulation and retirement income products and solutions. These products include fixed and indexed annuities, variable annuities, universal life insurance (“UL”), variable universal life insurance (“VUL”), linked-benefit UL, term life insurance, mutual funds and group life, disability and dental.   We provide products and services in two operating businesses and report results through four business segments as follows:       Business       Corresponding Segments        Retirement Solutions       Annuities                Defined Contribution                         Insurance Solutions       Life Insurance                Group Protection          These operating businesses and their segments are described in “Part I – Item 1. Business” of our 2010 Form 10-K. We also have Other Operations, which includes the financial data for operations that are not directly related to the business segments.   For information on how we derive our revenues, see the discussion in results of operations by segment below.   Current Market Conditions   Recent unfavorable market conditions including, but not limited to, the following concerns are weighing on and threatening the financial stability of the U.S. economy:        ·   Uncertainty regarding the long-term effect of the recently passed Budget Control Act of 2011;          ·    Revision of Standard and Poor’s (“S&P’s”) outlook on the long-term rating of the U.S. sovereign debt to negative from stable in April 2011 followed by placing the long-term and short-term debt ratings on watch with negative implications in July 2011; a credit rating review for the first time since 1996 by Moody’s Investors Service (“Moody’s”) followed by placing the ratings of the U.S. sovereign debt, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, the Federal Home Loan Bank System and the Farm Credit System on review for possible downgrade in July 2011; and warnings of possible downgrades of the U.S. sovereign debt by Fitch Ratings (“Fitch”) in June 2011;           56               ·    Persistent high unemployment, shrinking unemployment benefits and weak job creation;        ·    Slow and unpredictable U.S. housing market, as evidenced by the following:        §    The S&P/Case-Shiller® U.S. national home price index confirmed in May 2011 a double-dip in home prices across much of the U.S. based on data through March 2011, as home prices fell to their mid-2002 levels, followed by an increase in home prices for two consecutive months due to seasonal demand based on data through May 2011; and        §    U.S. home sales remained flat in June 2011, although contract cancellations, tight credit and tightened lending standards continued to constrain the housing market;        ·    Stressed economic and political conditions in Europe;        ·    Declining consumer confidence; and        ·    Ongoing conflicts in the Middle East.      The Federal Reserve’s projections for the remainder of 2011 and 2012 announced in June 2011 reflect weak growth and a slowing economic recovery. In the face of these economic challenges, we continue to focus on building our businesses through these difficult markets and beyond by developing and introducing high quality products, expanding distribution into new and existing key accounts and channels and targeting market segments that have high growth potential while maintaining a disciplined approach to managing our expenses.   As a result of our focus on building strong liquidity and capital positions and improving earnings in our core businesses, Moody’s improved its outlook on our company to positive from stable on June 22, 2011. For more information about ratings, see “Part I – Item 1. Business – Ratings” in our 2010 Form 10-K.   Significant Operational Matters   Earnings from Account Values   The Annuities and Defined Contribution segments are the most sensitive to the equity markets, as well as, to a lesser extent, our Life Insurance segment. We discuss the earnings effect of the equity markets on account values and the related asset-based earnings below in “Part I – Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – Equity Market Risk – Effect of Equity Market Sensitivity.” From December 31, 2010, to June 30, 2011, our account values were up $6.4 billion driven primarily by an increase in equity markets during the first six months of 2011 and positive net flows.   Improvement of Return on Equity   One of our highest priorities continues to be increasing our return on equity (“ROE”). Growth in ROE will be driven by a number of items including:       ·    Earnings mix shift to businesses with higher returns;        ·    Continued sales of products that have higher returns than the products already in force; and        ·    Capital management actions consisting of redeployment of excess capital (including returning capital to common stockholders) and further generation of excess capital.      Strategic Investments   We continue to make strategic investments in our businesses to grow revenues, further spur productivity and improve our efficiency and service to our customers. These efforts include investments in technology and system upgrades, new products for the voluntary market and expanded distribution focus.   Industry Trends   We continue to be influenced by a variety of trends that affect the industry. For information on these trends, see “Part II – Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Introduction – Executive Summary – Industry Trends” in our 2010 Form 10-K.   Issues and Outlook   For the remainder of 2011 and the near term, significant issues include:        ·     Increased actions by government and regulatory authorities to introduce regulations that could have a significant effect on our earnings and/or business models;           57               ·    Continuation of the low interest rate environment in comparison to historical periods;        ·    Implementation of new accounting requirements in 2012 that could have a significant effect on the earnings and/or business models of companies within the insurance industry, including Lincoln; and        ·    Loss ratios remaining at the high end of our long-term expectations in our Group Protection segment.      In the face of these issues and potential issues, we expect to focus on the following:       ·    Closely monitoring our capital and liquidity positions taking into account the uncertain economic recovery and changing statutory accounting and reserving practices;        ·    Continuing to explore additional financing strategies addressing the statutory reserve strain related to our secondary guarantee UL products in order to manage our capital position effectively in accordance with our pricing guidelines;        ·    Taking actions to manage the risk of a continuation of lower interest rates;        ·    Closely monitoring ongoing changes in the legal and regulatory environment;        ·    Controlling our non-medical loss ratios through continued focus on claims risk management;        ·    Increasing our product development activities together with identifying future product development initiatives;        ·    Evaluating opportunities for strategic investments in our businesses to grow revenues and further spur productivity; and        ·    Managing our expenses aggressively through process improvement initiatives combined with continued financial discipline and execution excellence throughout our operations.      For additional factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in this section, see “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2010 Form 10-K and “Forward-Looking Statements – Cautionary Language.”   Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates   The MD&A included in our 2010 Form 10-K contains a detailed discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates. The following information updates the “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” provided in our 2010 Form 10-K and, accordingly, should be read in conjunction with the “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” discussed in our 2010 Form 10-K.   DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL   Unlocking   As discussed and defined in our 2010 Form 10-K, we may record retrospective unlocking, prospective unlocking – assumption changes and prospective unlocking – model refinements on a quarterly basis that result in increases or decreases to the carrying values of DAC, VOBA, DSI, DFEL, embedded derivatives and reserves for life insurance and annuity products with living benefit and death benefit guarantees. The primary distinction between retrospective and prospective unlocking is that retrospective unlocking is driven by the difference between actual gross profits compared to estimated gross profits (“EGPs”) each period, while prospective unlocking is driven by changes in assumptions or projection models related to our expectations of future EGPs.   Reversion to the Mean   As equity markets do not move in a systematic manner, we reset the baseline of account values from which EGPs are projected, which we refer to as our “reversion to the mean” (“RTM”) process, as discussed in our 2010 Form 10-K.   As of June 30, 2011, our long-term separate account growth assumption rate is an immediate drop of approximately 15% and growth going forward of 9%, which is used in the determination of DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL amortization for the variable component of our variable annuity and VUL products, as this component is related primarily to underlying investments in equity funds within the separate accounts. If we were to have unlocked our RTM assumption in the corridor as of June 30, 2011, we would have recorded a favorable prospective unlocking of approximately $400 million, pre-tax, for our Retirement Solutions business, and approximately $35 million, pre-tax, for our Insurance Solutions business, as a result of improved market conditions since our last unlock of RTM in the fourth quarter of 2008.   Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets   As discussed in our 2010 Form 10-K, our stock price trading below book value requires us to evaluate and reassess each reporting period whether or not there is an indicator that would require us to perform an impairment test. We believe that our stock price has been unfavorably affected by macroeconomic events and concerns about the economic recovery and other concerns about the global economy as discussed above in “Current Market Conditions” and continues to be lower than our book value. We believe that our stock price is not representative of the underlying fair value of our reporting units and do not believe there is an indicator that requires us to perform an interim impairment test since our annual evaluation as of October 1, 2010. However, we will        58           continue to reassess each reporting period whether or not there is an indicator that would require us to perform an impairment test.   Investments   Investment Valuation   The following summarizes our investments carried at fair value by pricing source and the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topic of the FASB ASC hierarchy level (in millions):                                 As of June 30, 2011                     Quoted                                Prices                                in Active                                Markets for     Significant   Significant                      Identical      Observable    Unobservable   Total                  Assets     Inputs   Inputs   Fair                               (Level 1)      (Level 2)    (Level 3)       Value        Priced by third party pricing services   $    360        $    62,569        $    -            $    62,929         Priced by independent broker quotations        -             -             2,345                 2,345         Priced by matrices        -             8,674             -                 8,674         Priced by other methods (1)        -             -             1,431                 1,431             Total   $    360        $    71,243        $    3,776            $    75,379                                                                                        Percent of total       1%           94%           5%               100%              (1)    Represents primarily securities for which pricing models were used to compute the fair values.      For more information about the three-level hierarchy that we use to categorize our financial instruments carried at fair value, see “Part II – Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Introduction – Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Investments – Investment Valuation” in our 2010 Form 10-K and Note 13.   As of June 30, 2011, we evaluated the markets that our securities trade in and concluded that none were inactive. We will continue to re-evaluate this conclusion, as needed, based on market conditions. We use an internationally recognized pricing service as our primary pricing source, and we generally do not obtain multiple prices for our financial instruments. We generally use prices from the pricing service rather than broker quotes as we have documentation from the pricing service on the observable market inputs that they use to determine the prices in contrast to the broker quotes where we have limited information on the pricing inputs. As of June 30, 2011, we only obtained multiple prices for 44 available-for-sale (“AFS”) and trading securities. These multiple prices were related primarily to instances where the vendor was providing a price for the first time and we also received a broker quote. In these instances, we used the price from the pricing service due to the higher reliability as discussed above. As of June 30, 2011, we used broker quotes for 116 securities as our final price source, representing approximately 2% of total securities owned.   Derivatives   Our accounting policies for derivatives and the potential effect on interest spreads in a falling rate environment are discussed in Note 6 of this report and “Part II – Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” in our 2010 Form 10-K.   Guaranteed Living Benefits   As of June 30, 2011, the fair value of our derivative assets, which hedge both our GLB and GDB features, and including margins generated by futures contracts, was $992 million. As of June 30, 2011, the sum of all GLB liabilities at fair value, excluding the non-performance risk (“NPR”) adjustment, and GDB reserves was $373 million, comprised of $332 million for GLB liabilities and $41 million for the GDB reserves. The fair value of the hedge assets exceeded the estimated liabilities by $619 million. However, the relationship of hedge assets to the liabilities for the guarantees may vary in any given reporting period due to market conditions, hedge performance and/or changes to the hedging strategy.        59             Approximately 46% of our variable annuity account values contained a guaranteed withdrawal benefit (“GWB”) rider as of June 30, 2011. Declines in the equity markets increase our exposure to potential benefits under the GWB contracts, leading to an increase in our existing liability for those benefits. The increase in the equity markets over the recent months has decreased our existing liability. For example, a GWB contract is “in the money” if the contract holder’s account balance falls below the guaranteed amount. As of June 30, 2011, and June 30, 2010, 34% and 83% respectively, of all GWB in-force contracts were “in the money,” and our exposure to the guaranteed amounts, after reinsurance, as of June 30, 2011, and June 30, 2010, was $853 million and $3.1 billion, respectively. Our exposure before reinsurance for these same periods was $968 million and $3.5 billion, respectively.

The increase in net income was partially offset by the following:          ·    Higher benefits, excluding unlocking, driven primarily by:        §    Higher death claims; and        §    An increase in secondary guarantee life insurance product reserves from continued growth in the business;    partially offset by:     §    A decrease in the change in GDB reserves from a decrease in our expected GDB benefit payments attributable primarily to the increase in account values above guaranteed levels due to the more favorable equity markets; and        §    More favorable non-medical loss ratio experience within our Group Protection segment;        ·    Higher underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses, excluding amortization of DAC and VOBA, due primarily to:        §    Higher account values driving higher trail commissions;        §    Higher incentive compensation accruals as a result of higher earnings and production performance relative to targets; and        §    An increase in expenses associated with reserve financing supporting our secondary guarantee UL and term business due primarily to higher pricing that has occurred in reaction to the unfavorable market conditions experienced during the recession and our continued efforts to reduce the strain of these statutory reserves (see “Results of Insurance Solutions – Life Insurance – Income (Loss) from Operations – Strategies to Address Statutory Reserve Strain” below for more information);    partially offset by:     §    Higher legal expenses in 2010; and        ·    Realized losses in 2011 as compared to realized gains in 2010 attributable primarily to (see our discussion in “Realized Gain (Loss)” below for more information):        §    Higher other-than-temporary impairment (“OTTI”) on our AFS mortgage-backed securities (“MBS”) securities due to continued weakness within the commercial and residential real estate market that affected select residential mortgage-backed securities (“RMBS”) and commercial mortgage-backed securities (“CMBS”); and        §    Gains on GDB derivative results in 2010 as a result of the effect of unfavorable equity markets during 2010;    partially offset by:     §    The realized loss related to certain derivative instruments and trading securities during the second quarter of 2010 attributable primarily to spreads widening on corporate credit default swaps, which affected the derivative instruments related to our consolidated VIEs, partially offset by gains on our trading securities due to the decline in interest rates.      Comparison of the Six Months Ended June 30, 2011 to 2010   Net income increased due primarily to the following:        ·    Higher earnings from our variable annuity and mutual fund (within our Defined Contribution segment) products as a result of higher average account values driven by increases in the equity markets, and an increase in insurance fees, excluding unlocking, attributable primarily to growth in insurance in force;        ·    Higher net investment income and relatively flat interest credited, excluding unlocking, driven primarily by:        §    Higher average fixed account values, including the fixed portion of variable annuity contracts, attributable primarily to positive net flows and interest credited to contract holders, partially offset by transfers from fixed to variable;        §    Higher prepayment and bond makewhole premiums, more favorable investment income on alternative investments and higher portfolio yields on surplus (see “Consolidated Investments – Commercial Mortgage Loan Prepayment and Bond Makewhole Premiums” and “Consolidated Investments – Alternative Investments” below for more information); and        §    Reductions in crediting rates after the second quarter of 2010;    partially offset by:     §    The decline in new money rates and interest rates in general;        ·    A lower DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL amortization rate, net of interest, excluding unlocking, during the first six months of 2011 and a $37 million favorable retrospective unlocking of DAC, VOBA, DSI, DFEL and the reserves for life insurance and           64                   annuity products with living benefit and death benefit guarantees during the first six months of 2011, compared to a $5 million favorable retrospective unlocking during the first six months of 2010:        §    The lower amortization rate during the first six months of 2011 was due primarily to higher EGPs attributable to rider fees related to our products with living benefit guarantees and an overall shift in business mix towards products with lower deferrable expense rates;        §    The favorable retrospective unlocking during the first six months of 2011 was due primarily to higher equity markets, expense assessments and prepayment and bond makewhole premiums and lower lapses than our model projections assumed, partially offset by lower premiums received than our model projections assumed; and        §    The favorable retrospective unlocking during the first six months of 2010 was due primarily to higher equity markets and expense assessments and lower lapses than our model projections assumed, partially offset by the increase in the change in GDB reserves due to our GDB benefit ratio unlocking; and        ·    The realized loss related to certain derivative instruments and trading securities during the first six months of 2010 attributable primarily to spreads widening on corporate credit default swaps, which affected the derivative instruments related to our consolidated VIEs, partially offset by gains on our trading securities due to the decline in interest rates.              The increase in net income was partially offset by the following:          ·    Higher underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses, excluding amortization of DAC and VOBA, due primarily to:        §    Higher account values driving higher trail commissions;        §    Higher incentive compensation accruals as a result of higher earnings and production performance relative to targets;        §    An increase in expenses associated with reserve financing supporting our secondary guarantee UL and term business due primarily to higher pricing that has occurred in reaction to the unfavorable market conditions experienced during the recession and our continued efforts to reduce the strain of these statutory reserves (see “Results of Insurance Solutions – Life Insurance – Income (Loss) from Operations – Strategies to Address Statutory Reserve Strain” below for more information); and        §    Investments in strategic initiatives related to updating information technology and expanding distribution and support during the first six months of 2011;    partially offset by:     §    Higher legal expenses during the first six months of 2010;        ·    Higher benefits, excluding unlocking, driven primarily by:        §    Higher death claims; and        §    An increase in secondary guarantee life insurance product reserves from continued growth in the business;    partially offset by:     §    A decrease in the change in GDB reserves from a decrease in our expected GDB benefit payments attributable primarily to the increase in account values above guaranteed levels due to the more favorable equity markets and favorable mortality experience on single-premium immediate annuities; and        §    More favorable non-medical loss ratio experience within our Group Protection segment;        ·    Income from discontinued operations of $31 million during the first six months of 2010 related to our former Lincoln UK and Investment Management segments (see Note 3 for more information on our discontinued operations); and        ·    A $20 million favorable prospective unlocking of DAC, VOBA, DSI, DFEL and reserves for life insurance and annuity products with living benefit and death benefit guarantees during the first six months of 2011 compared to a $26 million favorable prospective unlocking during the first six months of 2010 (see “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL” for more information):        §    The favorable prospective unlocking during the first six months of 2011 was recorded in the Life Insurance segment and was due to a $19 million favorable unlocking from model refinements and a $1 million favorable unlocking from assumption changes; and        §    The favorable prospective unlocking during the first six months of 2010 was due to assumption changes in the Annuities segment.

(2)    Consists primarily of fees attributable to broker-dealer services that are subject to market volatility.      Comparison of the Three Months Ended June 30, 2011 to 2010   Income from operations for this segment increased due primarily to the following:       ·    Higher insurance fees driven primarily by higher average daily variable account values due to more favorable equity markets;        ·    A $30 million favorable retrospective unlocking of DAC, VOBA, DSI, DFEL and reserves for our guarantee riders and a lower DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL amortization rate, net of interest, excluding unlocking, during the second quarter of 2011, compared to a $21 million favorable retrospective unlocking during the second quarter of 2010:        §    The favorable retrospective unlocking during the second quarter of 2011 was due primarily to higher equity markets, expense assessments and prepayment and bond makewhole premiums and lower lapses than our model projections assumed;        §    The lower amortization rate during the second quarter of 2011 was due primarily to higher EGPs attributable to rider fees related to our products with living benefit guarantees; and        §    The favorable retrospective unlocking during the second quarter of 2010 was due primarily to higher equity markets and expense assessments and lower lapses than our model projections assumed; and        ·    Lower benefits, excluding SPIA (see footnote one above), due primarily to a decrease in the change in GDB reserves from a decrease in our expected GDB benefit payments attributable primarily to the increase in account values above guaranteed levels due to the more favorable equity markets.             66           The increase in income from operations was partially offset by the following:       ·    Higher underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses, excluding amortization of DAC and VOBA, due primarily to:        §    Higher account values driving higher trail commissions; and        §    Investments in strategic initiatives related to updating information technology and expanding distribution and support during the second quarter of 2011; and        ·    A $5 million favorable prospective unlocking of DAC, VOBA, DSI, DFEL and reserves for our guarantee riders during the second quarter of 2010 from assumption changes due to revising the estimate in our models for rider fees related to our annuity products with living benefit guarantees.      Comparison of the Six Months Ended June 30, 2011 to 2010   Income from operations for this segment increased due primarily to the following:       ·    Higher insurance fees driven primarily by higher average daily variable account values due to more favorable equity markets;        ·    A $56 million favorable retrospective unlocking of DAC, VOBA, DSI, DFEL and reserves for our guarantee riders and a lower DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL amortization rate, net of interest, excluding unlocking, during the first six months of 2011, compared to a $44 million favorable retrospective unlocking during the first six months of 2010:        §    The favorable retrospective unlocking during the first six months of 2011 was due primarily to higher equity markets, expense assessments and prepayment and bond makewhole premiums and lower lapses than our model projections assumed;        §    The lower amortization rate during the first six months of 2011 was due primarily to higher EGPs attributable to rider fees related to our products with living benefit guarantees; and        §    The favorable retrospective unlocking during the first six months of 2010 was due primarily to higher equity markets and expense assessments and lower lapses than our model projections assumed;        ·    Lower benefits, excluding SPIA (see footnote one above), due primarily to a decrease in the change in GDB reserves from a decrease in our expected GDB benefit payments attributable primarily to the increase in account values above guaranteed levels due to the more favorable equity markets and favorable mortality experience on single-premium immediate annuities; and        ·    Higher net investment income and relatively flat interest credited, excluding unlocking, driven primarily by:        §    Higher average fixed account values, including the fixed portion of variable annuity contracts, attributable primarily to positive net flows and interest credited to contract holders, partially offset by transfers from fixed to variable since the second quarter of 2010; and        §    Higher prepayment and bond makewhole premiums, an increase in surplus investments allocated to this segment, higher portfolio yields on surplus and more favorable investment income on alternative investments within our surplus portfolio (see “Consolidated Investments – Commercial Mortgage Loan Prepayment and Bond Makewhole Premiums” and “Consolidated Investments – Alternative Investments” below for more information);    partially offset by:     §    The decline in new money rates and interest rates in general.      The increase in income from operations was partially offset by the following:       ·    Higher underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses, excluding amortization of DAC and VOBA, due primarily to:        §    Higher account values driving higher trail commissions; and        §    Investments in strategic initiatives related to updating information technology and expanding distribution and support during the first six months of 2011; and        ·    A $26 million favorable prospective unlocking of DAC, VOBA, DSI, DFEL and reserves for our guarantee riders during the first six months of 2010 from assumption changes due to including an estimate in our models for rider fees related to our annuity products with living benefit guarantees.      Additional Information   During 2010, we completed the planned conversion of our actuarial valuation systems to a uniform platform for certain blocks of business. We have other blocks of business that we intend to convert. Although we expect some differences to emerge as a result of the planned conversion of the other blocks of business, based upon the current status of these efforts, we are not able to provide an estimate or range of the effects to our results of operations until completion of the conversion. In the third quarter of each year, we also conduct our annual comprehensive review of the assumptions and models used for our estimates of future gross profits underlying the amortization of DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL and the calculations of the embedded derivatives and reserves for annuity products with living benefit and death benefit guarantees. See “Part II – Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – DAC, VOBA, DSI and        67           DFEL” in our 2010 Form 10-K for a detailed discussion of our prospective unlocking process and information on our actuarial system conversion.   We expect higher expenses for this segment for the remainder of 2011 than was experienced in the first half of 2011. The expected increase is attributable primarily to expected increases in investments in strategic initiatives.   New deposits are an important component of net flows and key to our efforts to grow our business. Although deposits do not significantly affect current period income from operations, they are an important indicator of future profitability.   The other component of net flows relates to the retention of the business. An important measure of retention is the lapse rate, which compares the amount of withdrawals to the average account values. The overall lapse rate for our annuity products was 8% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2011, compared to 7% for the corresponding periods in 2010.   See Note 8 for information on contractual guarantees to contract holders related to GDB features for our Retirement Solutions business.   Our fixed annuity business includes products with discretionary crediting rates that are reset on an annual basis and are not subject to surrender charges. Our ability to retain annual reset annuities will be subject to current competitive conditions at the time interest rates for these products reset. We expect to manage the effects of spreads on near-term income from operations through portfolio management and, to a lesser extent, crediting rate actions, which assumes no significant changes in net flows into or out of our fixed accounts or other changes that may cause interest rate spreads to differ from our expectations. For information on interest rate spreads and the interest rate risk due to falling interest rates, see “Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – Interest Rate Risk – Interest Rate Risk on Fixed Insurance Businesses – Falling Rates” herein and “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors – Changes in interest rates and sustained low interest rates may cause interest rate spreads to decrease and changes in interest rates may also result in increased contract withdrawals” in our 2010 Form 10-K.   We provide information about this segment’s operating revenue and operating expense line items, the period in which amounts are recognized, key drivers of changes and historical details underlying the line items and their associated drivers below.

expenses. These assessments are a function of the rates priced into the product and the average daily variable account values. Average daily account values are driven by net flows and the equity markets. In addition, for our fixed annuity contracts and for some variable contracts, we collect surrender charges when contract holders surrender their contracts during their surrender charge periods to protect us from premature withdrawals. Insurance fees include charges on both our variable and fixed annuity products, but exclude the attributed fees on our GLB products; see “Realized Gain (Loss) – Operating Realized Gain (Loss) – GLB” below for discussion of these attributed fees.

We expect to earn a spread between what we earn on the underlying general account investments supporting the fixed annuity product line, including the fixed portion of variable annuity contracts, and what we credit to our fixed annuity contract holders’ accounts, including the fixed portion of variable annuity contracts. The interest rate spread for this segment represents the excess of the yield on invested assets on reserves over the average crediting rate. The yield on invested assets on reserves is calculated as net investment income, excluding the amounts attributable to our surplus investments, reverse repurchase agreement interest expense, inter-segment cash management program interest expense and interest on collateral divided by average invested assets on reserves. The average invested assets on reserves is calculated based upon total invested assets, excluding hedge derivatives and collateral. The average crediting rate is calculated as interest credited before DSI amortization, plus the immediate annuity reserve change (included within benefits) divided by the average fixed account values, including the fixed portion of variable annuity contracts, net of coinsured account values. Fixed account values reinsured under modified coinsurance agreements are included in account values for this calculation. Changes in commercial mortgage loan prepayments and bond makewhole premiums, investment income on alternative investments and surplus investment income can vary significantly from period to period due to a number of factors and, therefore, may contribute to investment income results that are not indicative of the underlying trends.   Benefits   Benefits for this segment include changes in reserves of immediate annuity account values driven by premiums, changes in GDB and GLB benefit reserves and our expected costs associated with purchases of derivatives used to hedge our GDB benefit ratio unlocking.          71           Underwriting, Acquisition, Insurance and Other Expenses   Details underlying underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses (in millions) were as follows:                                                     For the Three               For the Six                                                          Months Ended               Months Ended                                                          June 30,               June 30,                                                          2011        2010        Change       2011        2010        Change    Underwriting, Acquisition, Insurance                                                                    and Other Expenses                                                                Commissions:                                                                    Deferrable   $    125        $    127        -2%       $    237        $    224        6%        Non-deferrable        68             50        36%            133             103        29%    General and administrative expenses        93             82        13%            180             160        13%    Taxes, licenses and fees        7             5        40%            15             13        15%            Total expenses incurred, excluding                                                                             broker-dealer        293             264        11%            565             500        13%    DAC deferrals        (166)            (164)       -1%            (315)            (296)       -6%                    Total pre-broker-dealer expenses                                                                                    incurred, excluding amortization,                                                                                     net of interest        127             100        27%            250             204        23%    DAC and VOBA amortization, net of                                                                    interest:                                                                        Prospective unlocking - assumption                                                                             changes        -             (8)       100%            -             (39)       100%            Retrospective unlocking         (33)            (20)       -65%            (62)            (47)       -32%            Amortization, net of interest,                                                                             excluding unlocking        142             132        8%            289             270        7%    Broker-dealer expenses incurred        90             78        15%            182             154        18%                            Total underwriting, acquisition,                                                                                             insurance and other expenses   $    326        $    282        16%       $    659        $    542        22%                                                                                                               DAC Deferrals                                                                As a percentage of sales/deposits       5.7%           5.8%                   5.7%           5.8%              Commissions and other costs that vary with and are related primarily to the production of new business are deferred to the extent recoverable and are amortized over the lives of the contracts in relation to EGPs.

Fluctuations in these expenses correspond with fluctuations in other revenues and fees.          72           Defined Contribution   Income (Loss) from Operations   Details underlying the results for Defined Contribution (in millions) were as follows:                                                 For the Three               For the Six                                                      Months Ended             Months Ended                                                      June 30,               June 30,                                                      2011        2010        Change       2011        2010        Change    Operating Revenues                                                                Insurance fees   $    55        $    49        12%       $    110        $    100        10%    Net investment income        200             191        5%            405             377        7%    Other revenues and fees (1)        5             5        0%            8             9        -11%            Total operating revenues        260             245        6%            523             486        8%    Operating Expenses                                                                Interest credited        109             110        -1%            217             220        -1%    Benefits        -             -        NM            -             2        -100%    Underwriting, acquisition, insurance and                                                                    other expenses        91             85        7%            176             164        7%            Total operating expenses        200             195        3%            393             386        2%    Income (loss) from operations before                                                                    taxes        60             50        20%            130             100        30%    Federal income tax expense (benefit)        18             14        29%            39             28        39%                Income (loss) from operations   $    42        $    36        17%       $    91        $    72        26%          (1)   Consists primarily of mutual fund account program fees for mid-to-large employers.      Comparison of the Three Months Ended June 30, 2011 to 2010   Income from operations for this segment increased due primarily to the following:       ·    Higher net investment income and relatively flat interest credited driven primarily by:        §    Higher prepayment and bond makewhole premiums (see “Consolidated Investments – Commercial Mortgage Loan Prepayment and Bond Makewhole Premiums” below for more information);        §    Higher average fixed account values, including the fixed portion of variable annuity contracts, attributable primarily to interest credited to contract holders and transfers from variable to fixed, partially offset by negative net flows, since the second quarter of 2010; and        §    Reductions in crediting rates after the second quarter of 2010;        ·    Higher insurance fees driven primarily by higher average daily variable account values due to higher equity markets, partially offset by an overall shift in business mix toward products with lower expense assessment rates and negative net flows; and        ·    A $2 million unfavorable retrospective unlocking of DAC, VOBA and DSI during the second quarter of 2010 due primarily to higher lapses than our model projections assumed, partially offset by higher equity markets than our model projections assumed.      The increase in income from operations was partially offset by higher underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses, excluding amortization of DAC and VOBA, due primarily to the following:       ·    Investments in strategic initiatives related to updating information technology and expanding distribution and support during the second quarter of 2011, as discussed in “Additional Information” below; and        ·    Higher account values driving higher trail commissions.             73           Comparison of the Six Months Ended June 30, 2011 to 2010   Income from operations for this segment increased due primarily to the following:       ·    Higher net investment income and relatively flat interest credited driven primarily by:        §    Higher prepayment and bond makewhole premiums and more favorable investment income on alternative investments within our surplus portfolio (see “Consolidated Investments – Commercial Mortgage Loan Prepayment and Bond Makewhole Premiums” and “Consolidated Investments – Alternative Investments” below for more information);        §    Higher average fixed account values, including the fixed portion of variable annuity contracts, attributable primarily to interest credited to contract holders and transfers from variable to fixed, partially offset by negative net flows, since the second quarter of 2010; and        §    Reductions in crediting rates after the second quarter of 2010;        ·    A lower DAC, VOBA and DSI amortization rate, net of interest and excluding unlocking, and a $2 million favorable retrospective unlocking of DAC, VOBA and DSI during the first six months of 2011, compared to a $3 million unfavorable retrospective unlocking during the first six months of 2010:        §    The lower amortization rate during the first six months of 2011 was due primarily to an overall shift in business mix towards products with lower deferrable expense rates for this segment and no VOBA amortization during the first six months of 2011 as our VOBA balance became fully amortized during the fourth quarter of 2010;        §    The favorable retrospective unlocking during the first six months of 2011 was due primarily to higher equity markets and prepayment and bond makewhole premiums than our model projections assumed; and        §    The unfavorable retrospective unlocking during the first six months of 2010 was due primarily to higher lapses than our model projections assumed, partially offset by higher equity markets than our model projections assumed; and        ·    Higher insurance fees driven primarily by higher average daily variable account values due to higher equity markets, partially offset by an overall shift in business mix toward products with lower expense assessment rates.      The increase in income from operations was partially offset by higher underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses, excluding amortization of DAC and VOBA, due primarily to the following:       ·    Investments in strategic initiatives related to updating information technology and expanding distribution and support during the first six months of 2011, as discussed in “Additional Information” below; and        ·    Higher account values driving higher trail commissions.      Additional Information   In the third quarter of each year, we conduct our annual comprehensive review of the assumptions and models used for our estimates of future gross profits underlying the amortization of DAC, VOBA and DSI. See “Part II – Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL” in our 2010 Form 10-K for a detailed discussion of our prospective unlocking process.   We expect to continue to make investments in strategic initiatives during the remainder of 2011 similar to those made in the second quarter of 2011.   Net flows in this business fluctuate based on the timing of larger plans rolling onto our platform and rolling off over the course of the year, and we expect this trend will continue for the remainder of 2011.   New deposits are an important component of net flows and key to our efforts to grow our business. Although deposits do not significantly affect current period income from operations, they are an important indicator of future profitability. The other component of net flows relates to the retention of the business. An important measure of retention is the lapse rate, which compares the amount of withdrawals to the average account values. The overall lapse rate for our annuity and mutual fund products was 13% and 12% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2011, compared to 11% and 12% for the corresponding periods in 2010.    Our lapse rate is negatively affected by the continued net outflows from our oldest blocks of annuities business (as presented on our Account Value Roll Forward table below as “Total Multi-Fund® and Other Variable Annuities”), which are also our higher margin product lines in this segment, due to the fact that they are mature blocks with much of the account values out of their surrender charge period. The proportion of these products to our total account values was 41% and 43% as of June 30, 2011, and 2010, respectively. Due to this expected overall shift in business mix toward products with lower returns, a significant increase in new deposit production will be necessary to maintain earnings at current levels.   See Note 8 for information on contractual guarantees to contract holders related to GDB features for our Retirement Solutions business.        74           Our fixed annuity business includes products with discretionary and index-based crediting rates that are reset on a quarterly basis. Our ability to retain quarterly reset annuities will be subject to current competitive conditions at the time interest rates for these products reset. We expect to manage the effects of spreads on near-term income from operations through portfolio management and, to a lesser extent, crediting rate actions, which assumes no significant changes in net flows into or out of our fixed accounts or other changes that may cause interest rate spreads to differ from our expectations. For information on interest rate spreads and the interest rate risk due to falling interest rates, see “Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – Interest Rate Risk – Interest Rate Risk on Fixed Insurance Businesses – Falling Rates” herein and “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors – Changes in interest rates and sustained low interest rates may cause interest rate spreads to decrease and changes in interest rates may also result in increased contract withdrawals” in our 2010 Form 10-K.   We provide information about this segment’s operating revenue and operating expense line items, the period in which amounts are recognized, key drivers of changes and historical details underlying the line items and their associated drivers below.

Expense assessments are generally equal to a percentage of the daily variable account values. Average daily account values are driven by net flows and the equity markets. Our expense assessments include fees we earn for the services that we provide to our mutual fund programs. In addition, for both our fixed and variable annuity contracts, we collect surrender charges when contract holders surrender their contracts during the surrender charge periods to protect us from premature withdrawals.

We expect to earn a spread between what we earn on the underlying general account investments supporting the fixed annuity product line, including the fixed portion of variable annuity contracts, and what we credit to our fixed annuity contract holders’ accounts, including the fixed portion of variable annuity contracts. The interest rate spread for this segment represents the excess of the yield on invested assets on reserves over the average crediting rate. The yield on invested assets on reserves is calculated as net investment income, excluding the amounts attributable to our surplus investments, reverse repurchase agreement interest expense, inter-segment cash management program interest expense and interest on collateral, divided by average invested assets on reserves. The average invested assets on reserves are calculated based upon total invested assets, excluding hedge derivatives. The average crediting rate is calculated as interest credited before DSI amortization, divided by the average fixed account values, including the fixed portion of variable annuity contracts. Commercial mortgage loan prepayments and bond makewhole premiums, investment income on alternative investments and surplus investment income can vary significantly from period to period due to a number of factors and, therefore, may contribute to investment income results that are not indicative of the underlying trends.   Benefits   Benefits for this segment include changes in GDB and GLB benefit reserves and our expected costs associated with purchases of derivatives used to hedge our GDB benefit ratio unlocking.          79           Underwriting, Acquisition, Insurance and Other Expenses   Details underlying underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses (in millions) were as follows:                                               For the Three               For the Six                                                    Months Ended               Months Ended                                                    June 30,               June 30,                                                    2011        2010        Change       2011        2010        Change    Underwriting, Acquisition, Insurance                                                                    and Other Expenses                                                                Commissions:                                                                    Deferrable   $    6        $    7        -14%       $    11        $    13        -15%        Non-deferrable        11             9        22%            23             19        21%    General and administrative expenses        71             58        22%            134             111        21%    Taxes, licenses and fees        4             3        33%            9             7        29%            Total expenses incurred        92             77        19%            177             150        18%    DAC deferrals        (19)            (15)       -27%            (35)            (31)       -13%                Total expenses recognized before                                                                                amortization        73             62        18%            142             119        19%    DAC and VOBA amortization, net of                                                                    interest:                                                                        Retrospective unlocking        -             4        -100%            (3)            5        NM            Amortization, net of interest,                                                                            excluding unlocking        18             19        -5%            37             40        -8%                        Total underwriting, acquisition,                                                                                        insurance and other expenses   $    91        $    85        7%       $    176        $    164        7%                                                                                                         DAC Deferrals                                                                As a percentage of annuity sales/deposits       2.7%           2.2%                   2.4%           2.1%              Commissions and other costs that vary with and are related primarily to the sale of annuity contracts are deferred to the extent recoverable and are amortized over the lives of the contracts in relation to EGPs. Certain of our commissions, such as trail commissions that are based on account values, are expensed as incurred rather than deferred and amortized. We do not pay commissions on sales of our mutual fund products, and distribution expenses associated with the sale of these mutual fund products are expensed as incurred.   RESULTS OF INSURANCE SOLUTIONS   The Insurance Solutions business provides its products through two segments: Life Insurance and Group Protection. The Life Insurance segment offers wealth protection and transfer opportunities through term insurance, a linked-benefit product (which is a UL policy linked with riders that provide for long-term care costs) and both single (including corporate-owned UL and VUL (“COLI”) and bank-owned UL and VUL (“BOLI”)) and survivorship versions of UL and VUL insurance products.

The increase in income from operations was partially offset by the following:       ·    An increase in benefits, excluding unlocking, attributable primarily to:        §    Higher death claims;        §    An increase in secondary guarantee life insurance product reserves from model refinements and continued growth in the business; and        §    An increase in traditional product reserves due to the harmonization of certain processes, partially offset by a correction to traditional product surrender benefits;        ·    A $3 million favorable retrospective unlocking of DAC, VOBA and DFEL during the second quarter of 2010 due primarily to lower lapses than our model projections assumed, partially offset by lower premiums received than our model projections assumed; and           81               ·    An increase in underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other underwriting expenses, excluding amortization of DAC and VOBA, attributable primarily to:        §    An increase in expenses associated with reserve financing supporting our secondary guarantee UL and term business due primarily to higher pricing that has occurred in reaction to the unfavorable market conditions experienced during the recession and our continued efforts to reduce the strain of these statutory reserves (see “Strategies to Address Statutory Reserve Strain” below for more information); and        §    Higher incentive compensation accruals as a result of higher earnings and production performance relative to targets.      Comparison of the Six Months Ended June 30, 2011 to 2010   Income from operations for this segment increased due primarily to the following:       ·    Higher net investment income and relatively flat interest credited attributable primarily to:        §    Growth in business in force;        §    More favorable investment income on alternative investments, including those within our surplus portfolio, and higher prepayment and bond makewhole premiums (see “Consolidated Investments – Alternative Investments” and “Consolidated Investments – Commercial Mortgage Loan Prepayment and Bond Makewhole Premiums” below for more information); and        §    Reductions in crediting rates after the second quarter of 2010, discussed in “Additional Information” below;        ·    An increase in insurance fees, excluding unlocking, attributable primarily to growth in insurance in force; and        ·    A $20 million favorable prospective unlocking of DAC, VOBA, DFEL and secondary guarantee life insurance product reserves during the first six months of 2011 due to an $18 million favorable unlocking from model refinements and a $2 million favorable unlocking from assumption changes.      The increase in income from operations was partially offset by the following:       ·    An increase in benefits, excluding unlocking, attributable primarily to:        §    Higher death claims;        §    An increase in secondary guarantee life insurance product reserves from model refinements and continued growth in the business; and        §    An increase in traditional product reserves due to the harmonization of certain processes, partially offset by a correction to traditional product surrender benefits;        ·    A $12 million unfavorable retrospective unlocking of DAC, VOBA and DFEL compared to a $1 million unfavorable retrospective unlocking during the first six months of 2010:        §    The unfavorable retrospective unlocking during the first six months of 2011 was due primarily to lower premiums received than our model projections assumed; and        §    The unfavorable retrospective unlocking during the first six months of 2010 was due primarily to lower premiums received and investment income on alternative investments and prepayment and bond makewhole premiums and higher death claims than our model projections assumed, partially offset by lower lapses and expenses than our model projections assumed; and        ·    An increase in underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other underwriting expenses, excluding amortization of DAC and VOBA, attributable primarily to:        §    An increase in expenses associated with reserve financing supporting our secondary guarantee UL and term business due primarily to higher pricing that has occurred in reaction to the unfavorable market conditions experienced during the recession and our continued efforts to reduce the strain of these statutory reserves (see “Strategies to Address Statutory Reserve Strain” below for more information); and        §    Higher incentive compensation accruals as a result of higher earnings and production performance relative to targets.      Strategies to Address Statutory Reserve Strain   Our insurance subsidiaries have statutory surplus and RBC levels above current regulatory required levels. Products containing secondary guarantees require reserves calculated under Actuarial Guideline 38, or The Application of the Valuation of Life Insurance Policies Model Regulation (“AG38”). Our insurance subsidiaries are employing strategies to reduce the strain of increasing AG38 and Valuation of Life Insurance Policies Model Regulation (“XXX”) statutory reserves associated with secondary guarantee UL and term products. As discussed further below, we have been successful in executing reinsurance solutions to release capital to Other Operations. We expect to regularly execute transactions designed to release capital as we continue to sell products that are subject to these reserving requirements. We also plan to refinance prior transactions with long-term structured        82           solutions. We have introduced secondary guarantee UL products that are more capital efficient, designed to reduce our dependency on such reinsurance solutions.   Included in the letters of credit (“LOCs”) issued as of June 30, 2011, and reported in the credit facilities table in “Review of Consolidated Financial Condition – Liquidity and Capital Resources – Financing Activities,” was approximately $1.4 billion of long-dated LOCs issued to support inter-company reinsurance arrangements, of which approximately $600 million was issued for UL business with secondary guarantees through 2015 and approximately $800 million was issued for term business through 2023. LOCs and related capital market alternatives lower the capital effect of secondary guarantee UL products. An inability to obtain the necessary LOC capacity or other capital market alternatives could affect our returns on our in-force secondary guarantee UL business. However, we believe that our insurance subsidiaries have sufficient capital to support the increase in statutory reserves if such structures are not available. See “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors – Attempts to mitigate the impact of Regulation XXX and Actuarial Guideline 38 may fail in whole or in part resulting in an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations” in our 2010 Form 10-K for further information on XXX reserves. See the table in “Underwriting, Acquisition, Insurance and Other Expenses” below for the presentation of our expenses associated with reserve financing. We expect these expenses will approximately double in 2011 as compared to the level we experienced in 2010 as a result of higher pricing that has occurred in reaction to the unfavorable market conditions experienced during the recession and our expectation to execute additional reserve financing arrangements.   Additional Information   We are in the process of completing a conversion of our actuarial valuation systems to a uniform valuation platform for a significant portion of this segment’s blocks of business. Although we expect some differences to emerge as a result of this exercise, based upon the current status of these efforts, we are not able to provide an estimate or range of the effects to our results of operations until completion of the conversion. In the third quarter of each year, we also conduct our annual comprehensive review of the assumptions and models used for our estimates of future gross profits underlying the amortization of DAC, VOBA, DFEL and secondary guarantee life insurance product reserves. See “Part II – Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL” in our 2010 Form 10-K for a detailed discussion of our prospective unlocking process and information on our actuarial system conversion.   We expect higher expenses for this segment for the remainder of 2011 than was experienced in the first half of 2011. The expected increase is attributable primarily to expected increases in investments in strategic initiatives.   We expect to manage the effects of spreads on near-term income from operations through portfolio management and, to a lesser extent, crediting rate actions, which assumes no significant changes in net flows into or out of our fixed accounts or other changes that may cause interest rate spreads to differ from our expectations. During the second quarter of 2011, we refinanced the reverse treasury locks that we had executed during the fourth quarter of 2010 on $1.0 billion of assets backing our secondary guarantee business. We also executed reverse treasury locks on an additional $300 million, for a total of $1.3 billion of assets backing our secondary guarantee business at rates in excess of those required by product pricing. We entered into these reverse treasury locks to hedge cash flows over 2012 to 2016. On January 1, 2011, we implemented a 65 basis point decrease in crediting rates on most interest-sensitive products not already at contractual guarantees, which reduced overall crediting rates by approximately 7 basis points. During the third quarter of 2010, we lowered our new money investment yield assumption to reflect the then current new money rates and to approximate the forward curve for interest rates relevant at such time. The result was a drop in the current new money investment rate followed by a gradual annual recovery over eight years to a rate of 6.31%, 54 basis points below our previous ultimate long-term assumption of 6.85%. This assumption revision had the effect of lowering the projected EGPs for this segment, thereby increasing our rate of amortization, which results in higher DAC, VOBA and DFEL amortization and lower earnings for this segment.   For information on interest rate spreads and the interest rate risk due to falling interest rates, see “Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – Interest Rate Risk – Interest Rate Risk on Fixed Insurance Businesses – Falling Rates” herein and “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors – Changes in interest rates and sustained low interest rates may cause interest rate spreads to decrease and changes in interest rates may also result in increased contract withdrawals” in our 2010 Form 10-K.   Sales are not recorded as a component of revenues (other than for traditional products) and do not have a significant effect on current quarter income from operations but are indicators of future profitability. Generally, we have higher sales during the second half of the year with the fourth quarter being our strongest.   We provide information about this segment’s operating revenue and operating expense line items, the period in which amounts are recognized, key drivers of changes and historical details underlying the line items and their associated drivers below.   Insurance Premiums   Insurance premiums relate to traditional products and are a function of the rates priced into the product and the level of insurance in force. Insurance in force, in turn, is driven by sales, persistency and mortality experience.        83           Insurance Fees   Details underlying insurance fees, sales, net flows, account values and in-force face amount (in millions) were as follows:                                               For the Three               For the Six                                                    Months Ended               Months Ended                                                    June 30,               June 30,                                                    2011        2010        Change       2011        2010        Change    Insurance Fees                                                                Mortality assessments   $    327        $    325        1%       $    651        $    643        1%    Expense assessments        234             192        22%            464             392        18%    Surrender charges        29             24        21%            53             55        -4%    DFEL:                                                                    Deferrals        (116)            (114)       -2%            (242)            (232)       -4%        Amortization, net of interest:                                                                        Prospective unlocking - assumption                                                                            changes        19             -        NM            17             -        NM            Prospective unlocking - model                                                                            refinements        (14)            -        NM            (32)            -        NM            Retrospective unlocking        5             7        -29%            (6)            15        NM            Amortization, net of interest,                                                                            excluding unlocking        39             41        -5%            70             80        -13%                    Total insurance fees   $    523        $    475        10%       $    975        $    953        2%                                                  For the Three               For the Six                                                    Months Ended               Months Ended                                                    June 30,               June 30,                                                    2011        2010        Change       2011        2010        Change    Sales by Product                                                                UL:                                                                    Excluding MoneyGuard®   $    83        $    78        6%       $    168        $    168        0%        MoneyGuard®        39             23        70%            73             41        78%            Total UL        122             101        21%            241             209        15%    VUL        11             10        10%            21             17        24%    COLI and BOLI        10             10        0%            27             17        59%    Term        14             19        -26%            27             39        -31%                Total sales   $    157        $    140        12%       $    316        $    282        12%                                                                                                         Net Flows                                                                Deposits   $    1,274        $    1,063        20%       $    2,544        $    2,140        19%    Withdrawals and deaths        (406)            (413)       2%            (855)            (888)       4%        Net flows   $    868        $    650        34%       $    1,689        $    1,252        35%                                                                                                         Contract holder assessments   $    815        $    752        8%       $    1,621        $    1,515        7%             84                                                         As of June 30,                                                    2011        2010        Change    Account Values                                UL   $    26,990        $    25,425        6%    VUL        5,300             4,284        24%    Interest-sensitive whole life        2,277             2,256        1%        Total account values   $    34,567        $    31,965        8%                                                                         In-Force Face Amount                                UL and other   $    302,205        $    293,013        3%    Term insurance        268,520             259,450        3%        Total in-force face amount   $    570,725        $    552,463        3%      Insurance fees relate only to interest-sensitive products and include mortality assessments, expense assessments (net of deferrals and amortization related to DFEL) and surrender charges. Mortality and expense assessments are deducted from our contract holders’ account values. These amounts are a function of the rates priced into the product and premiums received, face amount in force and account values. Insurance in force, in turn, is driven by sales, persistency and mortality experience. In-force growth should be considered independently with respect to term products versus UL and other products, as term products have a lower profitability relative to face amount compared to interest-sensitive and other products.   Sales in the table above and as discussed above were reported as follows:       ·    UL (excluding linked-benefit products) and VUL (including COLI and BOLI) – first year commissionable premiums plus 5% of excess premiums received, including an adjustment for internal replacements of approximately 50% of commissionable premiums;        ·    MoneyGuard® (our linked-benefit product) – 15% of premium deposits; and        ·    Term – 100% of first year paid premiums.      UL and VUL products with secondary guarantees represented approximately 38% of interest-sensitive life insurance in force as of June 30, 2011, and approximately 51% and 50% of sales for the three and six months ended June 30, 2011, respectively. Actuarial Guideline 37, or Variable Life Reserves for Guaranteed Minimum Death Benefits, and AG38 impose additional statutory reserve requirements for these products.          85           Net Investment Income and Interest Credited   Details underlying net investment income, interest credited (in millions) and our interest rate spread were as follows:                                             For the Three               For the Six                                                  Months Ended               Months Ended                                                  June 30,               June 30,                                                  2011        2010        Change       2011        2010        Change    Net Investment Income                                                                Fixed maturity securities, mortgage loans                                                                     on real estate and other, net of                                                                     investment expenses   $    522        $    500        4%       $    1,040        $    988        5%    Commercial mortgage loan prepayment                                                                    and bond makewhole premiums (1)        11             6        83%            15             10        50%    Alternative investments (2)        23             14        64%            48             27        78%    Surplus investments (3)        32             25        28%            64             50        28%            Total net investment income   $    588        $    545        8%       $    1,167        $    1,075        9%                                                                                                       Interest Credited   $    307        $    299        3%       $    610        $    596        2%          (1)    See “Consolidated Investments – Commercial Mortgage Loan Prepayment and Bond Makewhole Premiums” below for additional information.

Invested assets will typically grow at a faster rate than account values because of the AG38 reserve requirements, which cause statutory reserves to grow at a faster rate than account values. Invested assets are based upon the statutory reserve liabilities and are therefore affected by various reserve adjustments, including capital transactions providing relief from AG38 reserve requirements, which leads to a transfer of invested assets from this segment to Other Operations for use in other corporate purposes. We expect to earn a spread between what we earn on the underlying general account investments and what we credit to our contract holders’ accounts. The interest rate spread for this segment represents the excess of the yield on invested assets on reserves over the average crediting rate on interest-sensitive products. The yield on invested assets on reserves is calculated as net investment income, excluding amounts attributable to our surplus investments and reverse repurchase agreement interest expense, divided by average invested assets on reserves. In addition, we exclude the effect of earnings from affordable housing tax credit securities, which is reflected as a reduction to federal income tax expense, from our spread calculations. We use our investment income to offset the earnings effect of the associated build of our policy reserves for traditional products. Commercial mortgage loan prepayments and bond makewhole premiums and investment income on alternative investments can vary significantly from period to period due to a number of factors, and, therefore, may contribute to investment income results that are not indicative of the underlying trends.

In addition, benefits includes the change in secondary guarantee life insurance product reserves. The reserve for secondary guarantees is affected by changes in expected future trends of expense assessments causing unlocking adjustments to this liability similar to DAC, VOBA and DFEL.

When comparing DAC and VOBA deferrals as a percentage of sales for the three and six months ended June 30, 2011 and 2010, the decrease is primarily a result of incurred deferrable commissions declining at a rate higher than sales attributable primarily to changes in sales mix to products with lower commission rates.          88           Group Protection   Income (Loss) from Operations   Details underlying the results for Group Protection (in millions) were as follows:                                                   For the Three               For the Six                                                        Months Ended               Months Ended                                                        June 30,               June 30,                                                        2011        2010        Change       2011        2010        Change    Operating Revenues                                                                Insurance premiums   $    460        $    434        6%       $    897        $    843        6%    Net investment income        38             34        12%            78             68        15%    Other revenues and fees        3             2        50%            4             4        0%            Total operating revenues        501             470        7%            979             915        7%    Operating Expenses                                                                Interest credited        1             1        0%            2             2        0%    Benefits        345             333        4%            672             644        4%    Underwriting, acquisition, insurance and                                                                    other expenses        115             101        14%            227             202        12%            Total operating expenses        461             435        6%            901             848        6%    Income (loss) from operations before                                                                    taxes        40             35        14%            78             67        16%    Federal income tax expense (benefit)        14             12        17%            27             23        17%                Income (loss) from operations   $    26        $    23        13%       $    51        $    44        16%                                                  For the Three               For the Six                                                    Months Ended               Months Ended                                                    June 30,               June 30,                                                    2011        2010        Change       2011        2010        Change    Income (Loss) from Operations by                                                                    Product Line                                                                Life   $    9        $    16        -44%       $    17        $    19        -11%    Disability        17             7        143%            34             25        36%    Dental        (1)            (1)       0%            (3)            (3)       0%        Total non-medical        25             22        14%            48             41        17%    Medical        1             1        0%            3             3        0%            Income (loss) from operations   $    26        $    23        13%       $    51        $    44        16%      Comparison of the Three and Six Months Ended June 30, 2011 to 2010   Income from operations for this segment increased due primarily to the following:       ·    More favorable non-medical loss ratio experience, partially offset by unfavorable non-waiver mortality experience within our life business during the second quarter of 2011 (see “Additional Information” below for more information);        ·    Growth in insurance premiums driven by normal, organic business growth in our non-medical products; and        ·    Higher net investment income driven by an increase in business and higher portfolio yields on surplus.      The increase in income from operations was partially offset by higher underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses due primarily to higher costs of investments in strategic initiatives associated with enhancements to sales processes and improvements to technology platforms during the three and six months ended June 30, 2011.          89           Additional Information   During the three and six months ended June 30, 2011, our non-medical loss ratios were 73.4% and 73.7%, respectively, below the 75.5% and 75.1% we experienced during the corresponding periods of 2010, and on the high end of our long-term expectation of 71% to 74%. Although we experienced improvement in our long-term disability loss ratios during 2011 as compared to unfavorable experience throughout 2010, loss ratios in general are likely to remain at the high end of our long-term expectation in 2011, as demonstrated by our disability claim incidence and short-term disability claim durations still being at elevated levels. However, we expect loss ratios to recover over time. For every one percent increase in the loss ratio above our expectation, we would expect an approximate annual $10 million to $12 million decrease to income from operations.   Management compares trends in actual loss ratios to pricing expectations because group-underwriting risks change over time. We expect normal fluctuations in our composite non-medical loss ratios of this segment, as claims experience is inherently uncertain. We are taking actions to manage the effects of our loss ratio results, such as implementing price adjustments on our product lines upon renewal to better reflect our experience going forward. In addition, we have been focusing on managing the higher volume of incidence through claims risk management, including contracting additional resources to help reduce caseloads and improve claim recovery experience so that incidence volumes do not detract from our claim recovery efforts. We are also employing new tools to identify and support claimants who will return to work.   We expect higher expenses for this segment for the remainder of 2011 than was experienced in the first half of 2011. The expected increase is attributable primarily to expected increases in investments in strategic initiatives.   We are evaluating the potential effects that health care reform may have on the value and profitability of this segment’s products and income from operations, including, but not limited to, potential changes to traditional sources of income for our brokers who may seek additional portfolio options and/or modification to compensation structures.   During the second quarter of 2011, we reviewed the discount rate assumptions associated with reserves for long-term disability and life waiver claim incurrals. Due to the persistent decline in new money investment yields, we lowered the discount rate by 50 basis points to 4.25% on new incurrals, which decreased income from operations by $3 million during the second quarter of 2011. For information on the effects of current interest rates on our long-term disability claim reserves, see “Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – Interest Rate Risk – Interest Rate Risk on Fixed Insurance Businesses – Falling Rates.”   Sales relate to long-duration contracts sold to new contract holders and new programs sold to existing contract holders. We believe that the trend in sales is an important indicator of development of business in force over time. Our sales declined during the first six months of 2011 as compared to the corresponding period of 2010 due to conditions in the marketplace.   We provide information about this segment’s operating revenue and operating expense line items, the period in which amounts are recognized, key drivers of changes and historical details underlying the line items and their associated drivers below.

The premiums are a function of the rates priced into the product and our business in force. Business in force, in turn, is driven by sales and persistency experience. Sales in the table above are the combined annualized premiums for our life, disability and dental products.   Net Investment Income   We use our investment income to offset the earnings effect of the associated build of our policy reserves, which are a function of our insurance premiums and the yields on our invested assets.

Broker commissions, which vary with and are related to paid premiums, are expensed as incurred. The level of expenses is an important driver of profitability for this segment as group insurance contracts are offered within an environment that competes on the basis of price and service.   RESULTS OF OTHER OPERATIONS   Other Operations includes investments related to the excess capital in our insurance subsidiaries; investments in media properties and other corporate investments; benefit plan net liability; the unamortized deferred gain on indemnity reinsurance related to the sale of reinsurance to Swiss Re in 2001; the results of certain disability income business; the Institutional Pension business, which is a closed-block of pension business, the majority of which was sold on a group annuity basis, and is currently in run-off; and debt costs. We are actively managing our remaining radio station clusters to maximize performance and future value.

The decrease in loss from operations was partially offset by the following:       ·    Higher interest and debt expense attributable to higher average balances of outstanding debt in 2011; and        ·    Lower net investment income net of interest credited, due primarily to:        §    Lower average invested assets driven primarily by repurchases of common stock, net cash used in operating activities primarily due to interest payments, write-downs for OTTI and payments of income taxes, partially offset by distributable earnings received from our insurance segments and proceeds from issuances debt; and        §    The decline in new money rates and interest rates in general.      When comparing the three months ended June 30, 2011 to 2010, the decrease in loss from operations was also partially offset by more favorable tax items during the second quarter of 2010 that affected the federal income tax benefit.   Additional Information   We expect higher expenses for Other Operations for the remainder of 2011 than was experienced in the first half of 2011. The expected increase is attributable primarily to expected increases in branding and non-branding marketing expenses.   We provide information about Other Operations’ operating revenue and operating expense line items, the period in which amounts are recognized, key drivers of changes and historical details underlying the line items and their associated drivers below.   The results of Other Operations include our thrift business. We are in the process of exiting this business, which will not have a significant effect on Other Operations’ results.         93           Net Investment Income and Interest Credited   We utilize an internal formula to determine the amount of capital that is allocated to our business segments. Investment income on capital in excess of the calculated amounts is reported in Other Operations. If regulations require increases in our insurance segments’ statutory reserves and surplus, the amount of capital retained by Other Operations would decrease and net investment income would be negatively affected. In addition, as discussed below in “Review of Consolidated Financial Condition – Liquidity and Capital Resources – Sources of Liquidity and Cash Flow – Alternative Sources of Liquidity,” we maintain an inter-segment cash management program where certain subsidiaries can borrow from or lend money to the holding company to meet short-term borrowing needs. The inter-segment cash management program affects net investment income for Other Operations, as all inter-segment eliminations are reported within Other Operations.   Write-downs for OTTI decrease the recorded value of our invested assets owned by our business segments. These write-downs are not included in the income from operations of our operating segments. When impairment occurs, assets are transferred to the business segments’ portfolios and will reduce the future net investment income for Other Operations, but should not have an effect on a consolidated basis unless the impairments are related to defaulted securities. Statutory reserve adjustments for our business segments can also cause allocations of invested assets between the affected segments and Other Operations.   The majority of our interest credited relates to our reinsurance operations sold to Swiss Re in 2001. A substantial amount of the business was sold through indemnity reinsurance transactions, which is still recorded in our consolidated financial statements. The interest credited corresponds to investment income earnings on the assets we continue to hold for this business. There is no effect to income or loss in Other Operations or on a consolidated basis for these amounts because interest earned on the blocks that continue to be reinsured is passed through to Swiss Re in the form of interest credited.   Benefits   Benefits are recognized when incurred for Institutional Pension products and disability income business.

(2)    Includes the result of actions undertaken by us to eliminate duplicate operations and functions as a result of the Jefferson-Pilot merger along with costs related to the implementation of our unified product portfolio and other initiatives. These actions were completed during 2010. Our cumulative integration expense was approximately $225 million, pre-tax, which excluded amounts capitalized or recorded as goodwill.        (3)    Consists of reimbursements to Other Operations from the Life Insurance segment for the use of proceeds from certain issuances of senior notes that were used as long-term structured solutions, net of expenses incurred by Other Operations for its use of LOCs. The inter-segment amounts are not reported on our Consolidated Statements of Income.           94            Interest and Debt Expense   Our current level of interest expense may not be indicative of the future due to, among other things, the timing of the use of cash, the availability of funds from our inter-company cash management program and the future cost of capital.

For factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in this section, see “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2010 Form 10-K and “Forward-Looking Statements – Cautionary Language” above.   For information on our counterparty exposure see “Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.”   Comparison of the Three and Six Months Ended June 30, 2011 to 2010   We had realized losses during the three months ended June 30, 2011, as compared to gains for the corresponding period of 2010, due primarily to an increase in OTTI attributable primarily to continued weakness within the commercial and residential real estate market that affected select RMBS and CMBS holdings, in addition to less favorable hedge program performance, partially offset by a decrease in losses on derivative investments.   We had lower realized losses during the six months ended June 30, 2011, as compared to the corresponding period of 2010, due primarily to a decline in OTTI attributable primarily to overall improvement in the credit markets and gains on derivative investments as compared to losses in the corresponding period of 2010, partially offset by less favorable hedge program performance.   Our GLB net derivatives results during the three and six months ended June 30, 2011 and 2010 were relatively flat. The GLB net derivatives results were unfavorably affected by our over-hedged position due to a decline in implied volatilities during the first six        95           months of 2011. The unfavorable hedge results were partially offset by the NPR component of the liability being favorable during this same period attributable to an increase in the NPR factors related to beyond 10-year CDS spreads. See “GLB Net Derivatives Results” below for a discussion of how our NPR adjustment is determined.    We experienced GDB derivative losses during the three and six months ended June 30, 2011, and GDB derivative gains during the corresponding periods of 2010, attributable primarily to favorable equity market experience during 2011 and unfavorable equity market experience during 2010, respectively. These GDB derivative results offset some of the change in our benefit ratio unlocking, which is not reported in realized gain (loss), but the amount is disclosed in “Results of Consolidated Operations” above.   The more favorable results related to certain derivative instruments and trading securities during the three and six months ended June 30, 2011, as compared to the corresponding periods of 2010, were attributable primarily to widening spreads on corporate credit default swaps during 2010, which affected the derivative instruments related to our consolidated VIEs, partially offset by gains on our trading securities due to the decline in interest rates during 2010.

Operating realized gain (loss) includes the following:   Indexed Annuity Net Derivatives Results   Indexed annuity net derivatives results represent the net difference between the change in the fair value of the S&P 500 call options that we hold and the change in the fair value of the embedded derivative liabilities of our indexed annuity products. The change in the fair value of the liability for the embedded derivative represents the amount that is credited to the indexed annuity contract.          96           GLB   Our GWB, guaranteed income benefit (“GIB”) and 4LATER® features have elements of both benefit reserves and embedded derivative reserves. We calculate the value of the embedded derivative reserve and the benefit reserve based on the specific characteristics of each GLB feature. For our GLBs that meet the definition of an embedded derivative under the Derivatives and Hedging Topic of the FASB ASC, we record them at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in realized gain (loss) on our Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss). In bifurcating the embedded derivative, we attribute to the embedded derivative the portion of total fees collected from the contract holder that relates to the GLB riders (the “attributed fees”). These attributed fees represent the present value of future claims expected to be paid for the GLB at the inception of the contract (the “net valuation premium”) plus a margin that a theoretical market participant would include for risk/profit (the “risk/profit margin”).   We include the risk/profit margin portion of the GLB attributed rider fees in operating realized gain (loss) and include the net valuation premium of the GLB attributed rider fees in excluded realized gain (loss). For our Annuities and Defined Contribution segments, the excess of total fees collected from the contract holders over the GLB attributed rider fees is reported in insurance fees.   Realized Gain (Loss) Related to Certain Investments   See “Consolidated Investments – Realized Gain (Loss) Related to Certain Investments” below.   Realized Gain (Loss) Related to Certain Derivative Instruments, Including Those Associated With Our Consolidated VIEs, and Trading Securities   Realized gain (loss) related to certain derivative instruments, including those associated with our consolidated VIEs and trading securities represents changes in the fair values of certain derivative investments (including the credit default swaps and contingent forwards associated with consolidated VIEs), total return swaps (embedded derivatives that are theoretically included in our various modified coinsurance and coinsurance with funds withheld reinsurance arrangements that have contractual returns related to various assets and liabilities associated with these arrangements) and trading securities.

GLB Net Derivatives Results   Our GLB net derivatives results are comprised of the net valuation premium, the change in the GLB embedded derivative reserves and the change in the fair value of the derivative instruments we own to hedge them, including the cost of purchasing the hedging instruments.   Our GWB, GIB and 4LATER® features have elements of both benefit reserves and embedded derivative reserves. We calculate the value of the embedded derivative reserve and the benefit reserve based on the specific characteristics of each GLB feature. We record the embedded derivative reserve on our GLBs at fair value on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We use derivative instruments to hedge our exposure to the risks and earnings volatility that result from changes in the GLB embedded derivatives reserves. The change in fair value of these derivative instruments is designed to generally offset the change in embedded derivative reserves. In the table above, we have presented the components of our GLB results, which can be volatile especially when sudden and significant changes in equity markets and/or interest rates occur. When we assess the effectiveness of our hedge program, we exclude the effect of the change in the component of the embedded derivative reserves related to the required NPR. We do not attempt to hedge the change in the NPR component of the liability. As of June 30, 2011, the net effect of the NPR resulted in a $28 million decrease in the liability for our GLB embedded derivative reserves. The NPR factors affect the discount rate used in the calculation of the GLB embedded derivative reserve. Our methodology for calculating the NPR component of the embedded derivative reserve utilizes an extrapolated 30-year NPR spread curve applied to a series of expected cash flows over the expected life of the embedded derivative. Our cash flows consist of both expected fees to be received from contract holders and benefits to be paid, and these cash flows are different on a pre- and post- NPR basis. We utilize a model based on our holding company’s        98           credit default swap (“CDS”) spreads adjusted for items, such as the liquidity of our holding company CDS. Because the guaranteed benefit liabilities are contained within our insurance subsidiaries, we apply items, such as the effect of our insurance subsidiaries’ claims-paying ratings compared to holding company credit risk and the over-collateralization of insurance liabilities, in order to determine factors that are representative of a theoretical market participant’s view of the NPR of the specific liability within our insurance subsidiaries.   Details underlying the NPR component and associated effect to our GLB embedded derivative reserves (dollars in millions) were as follows:                                       As of           As of           As of           As of           As of                                    June 30,   March 31,   December 31,   September 30,   June 30,                                    2011            2011            2010            2010            2010         10-year CDS spread           2.02%               1.78%               1.98%               2.55%               2.94%        NPR factor related to 10-year CDS spread           0.24%               0.17%               0.17%               0.30%               0.40%        Unadjusted embedded derivative liability       $    306            $    112            $    389            $    1,556            $    1,786           Estimating what the absolute amount of the NPR effect will be period to period is difficult due to the utilization of all cash flows and the shape of the spread curve. Currently, we estimate that if the NPR factors as of June 30, 2011, were to have been zero along all points on the spread curve, then the NPR offset to the unadjusted liability would have resulted in an unfavorable effect to net income of approximately $120 million, pre-DAC and tax. Alternatively, if the NPR factors were 20 basis points higher along all points on the spread curve as of June 30, 2011, then there would have been a favorable effect to net income of approximately $50 million, pre-DAC and tax. In the preceding two sentences, “DAC” refers to the associated amortization of DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL. Changing market conditions could cause this relationship to deviate significantly in future periods. Sensitivity within this range is primarily a result of volatility in our CDS spreads and the slope of the CDS spread term structure.   For additional information on our guaranteed benefits, see “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Derivatives – Guaranteed Living Benefits” above.   GDB Derivatives Results   Our GDB derivatives results represent the change in the fair value of the derivative instruments we own to hedge the change in our benefit ratio unlocking, excluding our expected cost of the hedging instruments.   Indexed Annuity Forward-Starting Option   Details underlying indexed annuity forward-starting option (in millions) were as follows:                                             For the Three               For the Six                                                  Months Ended               Months Ended                                                  June 30,               June 30,                                                  2011        2010        Change       2011        2010        Change                                                                                                       Indexed Annuity Forward-Starting                                                                    Option                                                                Pre-DAC amounts (1)   $    -        $    6        -100%       $    4        $    10        -60%    Associated amortization of DAC, VOBA,                                                                     DSI and DFEL        -             (3)       100%            (1)            (5)       80%            Total   $    -        $    3        -100%       $    3        $    5        -40%          (1)    DAC refers to the associated amortization of DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL.      The liability for the forward-starting option reflects changes in the fair value of embedded derivative liabilities related to index call options we may purchase in the future to hedge contract holder index allocations applicable to future reset periods for our indexed annuity products accounted for under the Derivatives and Hedging and the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topics of the FASB ASC. These fair values represent an estimate of the cost of the options we will purchase in the future, discounted back to the date of the balance sheet, using current market indications of volatility and interest rates, which can vary significantly from period to period due to a number of factors and therefore can provide results that are not indicative of the underlying trends.        99               CONSOLIDATED INVESTMENTS   Details underlying our consolidated investment balances (in millions) were as follows:                                                                   Percentage of                                                                        Total Investments                                        As of           As of           As of           As of                                    June 30,   December 31,   June 30,   December 31,                                    2011            2010            2011            2011             Investments                                                                AFS securities:                                                                    Fixed maturity       $    70,920            $    68,030            82.2%           81.6%                VIEs' fixed maturity            593                 584            0.7%           0.7%                    Total fixed maturity            71,513                 68,614            82.9%           82.3%                Equity            144                 197            0.2%           0.2%            Trading securities            2,625                 2,596            3.0%           3.1%            Mortgage loans on real estate            6,871                 6,752            8.0%           8.1%            Real estate            150                 202            0.2%           0.3%            Policy loans            2,877                 2,865            3.3%           3.5%            Derivative investments            1,097                 1,076            1.3%           1.3%            Alternative investments            800                 750            0.9%           0.9%            Other investments            201                 288            0.2%           0.3%                        Total investments       $    86,278            $    83,340            100.0%           100.0%              Investment Objective   Invested assets are an integral part of our operations. We follow a balanced approach to investing for both current income and prudent risk management, with an emphasis on generating sufficient current income, net of income tax, to meet our obligations to customers, as well as other general liabilities. This balanced approach requires the evaluation of expected return and risk of each asset class utilized, while still meeting our income objectives. This approach is important to our asset-liability management because decisions can be made based upon both the economic and current investment income considerations affecting assets and liabilities. For a discussion on our risk management process, see “Part II – Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” in our 2010 Form 10-K.   Investment Portfolio Composition and Diversification   Fundamental to our investment policy is diversification across asset classes. Our investment portfolio, excluding cash and invested cash, is composed of fixed maturity securities, mortgage loans on real estate, real estate (either wholly-owned or in joint ventures) and other long-term investments. We purchase investments for our segmented portfolios that have yield, duration and other characteristics that take into account the liabilities of the products being supported.   We have the ability to maintain our investment holdings throughout credit cycles because of our capital position, the long-term nature of our liabilities and the matching of our portfolios of investment assets with the liabilities of our various products.   Fixed Maturity and Equity Securities Portfolios   Fixed maturity securities and equity securities consist of portfolios classified as AFS and trading. Mortgage-backed and private securities are included in both AFS and trading portfolios.   Details underlying our fixed maturity and equity securities portfolios by industry classification (in millions) are presented in the tables below. These tables agree in total with the presentation of AFS securities in Note 5; however, the categories below represent a more detailed breakout of the AFS portfolio; therefore, the investment classifications listed below do not agree to the investment categories provided in Note 5.        100                                       As of June 30, 2011                                                  Unrealized                   %                          Amortized       Unrealized       Losses       Fair       Fair                          Cost       Gains       and OTTI       Value       Value    Fixed Maturity AFS Securities                                                        Industry corporate bonds:                                                            Financial services   $    8,582        $    489        $    128        $    8,943        12.5%        Basic industry        2,839             219             14             3,044        4.3%        Capital goods        3,873             260             27             4,106        5.7%        Communications        3,190             271             29             3,432        4.8%        Consumer cyclical        2,930             197             44             3,083        4.3%        Consumer non-cyclical        7,673             656             17             8,312        11.6%        Energy        4,734             433             15             5,152        7.2%        Technology        1,769             113             7             1,875        2.6%        Transportation        1,446             120             3             1,563        2.2%        Industrial other        940             55             6             989        1.4%        Utilities        10,245             769             61             10,953        15.4%    Corporate asset-backed securities ("ABS"):                                                            Collateralized debt obligations ("CDOs")        97             5             4             98        0.1%        Commercial real estate ("CRE") CDOs        40             -

Refer to the “Trading Securities” section of our 2010 Form 10-K for further details.           102           AFS Securities   The general intent of the AFS accounting guidance is to reflect stockholders’ equity as if unrealized gains and losses were actually recognized, and it is necessary that we consider all related accounting adjustments that would occur upon such a hypothetical recognition of unrealized gains and losses. Such related balance sheet effects include adjustments to the balances of DAC, VOBA, DFEL, other contract holder funds and deferred income taxes. Adjustments to each of these balances are charged or credited to accumulated OCI. For instance, DAC is adjusted upon the recognition of unrealized gains or losses because the amortization of DAC is based upon an assumed emergence of gross profits on certain insurance business. Deferred income tax balances are also adjusted because unrealized gains or losses do not affect actual taxes currently paid.

For securities where the ratings assigned by the major credit agencies are not equivalent, the second highest rating assigned is used. For those securities where ratings by the major credit rating agencies are not available, which does not represent a significant amount of our total fixed maturity AFS securities, we base the ratings disclosed upon internal ratings.      Comparisons between the NAIC ratings and rating agency designations are published by the NAIC. The NAIC assigns securities quality ratings and uniform valuations, which are used by insurers when preparing their annual statements. The NAIC ratings are similar to the rating agency designations of the Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations for marketable bonds. NAIC ratings 1 and 2 include bonds generally considered investment grade (rated Baa3 or higher by Moody’s, or rated BBB- or higher by S&P and Fitch), by such ratings organizations. However, securities rated NAIC 1 and NAIC 2 could be below investment grade by the rating agencies, which is a result of the changes in the RBC rules for RMBS and CMBS for statutory reporting. NAIC ratings 3 through 6 include bonds generally considered below investment grade (rated Ba1 or lower by Moody’s, or rated BB+ or lower by S&P and Fitch).    Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain are experiencing stress in the credit markets. As of June 30, 2011, the amortized cost and fair value of our total sovereign exposure was $3 million to Italy. We also had AFS securities in a large Spanish bank, where our investments were in subsidiaries located outside of Spain, with an amortized cost of $48 million and a fair value of $50 million as of June 30, 2011. Other banking exposure to these countries as of June 30, 2011, included a $14 million notional CDS position where we have sold protection on a highly rated multi-national Spanish bank.         103           Our total non-banking and non-sovereign AFS securities to Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain had an amortized cost of $780 million and a fair value of $813 million as of June 30, 2011, approximately 50% of which related to large multinational companies domiciled in those countries. The detailed breakout by country was as follows: Ireland – $229 million amortized cost and $226 million fair value; Italy – $161 million amortized cost and $175 million fair value; Portugal – $40 million amortized cost and $34 million fair value; and Spain – $350 million amortized cost and fair value $378 million.      As of June 30, 2011, and December 31, 2010, 81.0% and 79.8%, respectively, of the total publicly traded and private securities in an unrealized loss status were rated as investment grade. See Note 5 for maturity date information for our fixed maturity investment portfolio. Our gross unrealized losses on AFS securities as of June 30, 2011, decreased $334 million. This change was attributable primarily to a decline in overall market yields, which was driven by market uncertainty and weakening economic activity. As more fully described in Note 1 of our 2010 Form 10-K, we regularly review our investment holdings for OTTI. We believe the unrealized loss position as of June 30, 2011, does not represent OTTI as we do not intend to sell these debt securities, it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the debt securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis, the estimated future cash flows are equal to or greater than the amortized cost basis of the debt securities, or we have the ability and intent to hold the equity securities for a period of time sufficient for recovery. For further information on our AFS securities unrealized losses, see “Additional Details on our Unrealized Losses on AFS Securities” below.   Selected information for certain AFS securities in a gross unrealized loss position (dollars in millions) was as follows:                       As of June 30, 2011                                    Gross       Estimated       Estimated                                                        Unrealized       Years       Average                                                        Losses       until Call       Years                                            Fair       and       or       until       Subordination Level                        Value       OTTI       Maturity       Recovery       Current       Origination    CMBS   $    269        $    (102)       1 to 42       29        20.9%           16.7%        Hybrid and redeemable                                                                    preferred securities        622             (107)       1 to 55       32        N/A           N/A          As provided in the table above, many of the securities in these categories are long-dated with some of the preferred securities being perpetual. This is purposeful as it matches the long-term nature of our liabilities associated with our life insurance and annuity products. See “Part II – Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” in our 2010 Form 10-K where we present information related to maturities of securities and the expected cash flows for rate sensitive liabilities and maturities of our holding company debt, which also demonstrates the long-term nature of the cash flows associated with these items. Because of this relationship, we do not believe it will be necessary to sell these securities before they recover or mature. For these securities, the estimated range and average period until recovery is the call or maturity period. It is difficult to predict or project when the securities will recover as it is dependent upon a number of factors including the overall economic climate. We do not believe it is necessary to impair these securities as long as the expected future cash flows are projected to be sufficient to recover the amortized cost of these securities.   The actual range and period until recovery could vary significantly depending on a variety of factors, many of which are out of our control. There are several items that could affect the length of the period until recovery, such as the pace of economic recovery, level of delinquencies, performance of the underlying collateral, changes in market interest rates, exposures to various industry or geographic conditions, market behavior and other market conditions.   We concluded that it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the fixed maturity AFS securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis, that the estimated future cash flows are equal to or greater than the amortized cost basis of the debt securities, and that we have the ability to hold the equity AFS securities for a period of time sufficient for recovery. This conclusion is consistent with our asset-liability management process. Management considers the following as part of the evaluation:       ·    The current economic environment and market conditions;        ·    Our business strategy and current business plans;        ·    The nature and type of security, including expected maturities and exposure to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risk;        ·    Our analysis of data from financial models and other internal and industry sources to evaluate the current effectiveness of our hedging and overall risk management strategies;        ·    The current and expected timing of contractual maturities of our assets and liabilities, expectations of prepayments on investments and expectations for surrenders and withdrawals of life insurance policies and annuity contracts;        ·    The capital risk limits approved by management; and           104               ·    Our current financial condition and liquidity demands.      To determine the recoverability of a debt security, we consider the facts and circumstances surrounding the underlying issuer including, but not limited to, the following:       ·    Historic and implied volatility of the security;        ·    Length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than amortized cost;        ·    Adverse conditions specifically related to the security or to specific conditions in an industry or geographic area;        ·    Failure, if any, of the issuer of the security to make scheduled payments; and        ·    Recoveries or additional declines in fair value subsequent to the balance sheet date.      As reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, we had $89.2 billion of investments and cash, which exceeded the liabilities for our future obligations under insurance policies and contracts, net of amounts recoverable from reinsurers, which totaled $79.2 billion as of June 30, 2011. If it were necessary to liquidate securities prior to maturity or call to meet cash flow needs, we would first look to those securities that are in an unrealized gain position, which had a fair value of $59.6 billion, excluding consolidated VIEs in the amount of $593 million, as of June 30, 2011, rather than selling securities in an unrealized loss position. The amount of cash that we have on hand at any point of time takes into account our liquidity needs in the future, other sources of cash, such as the maturities of investments, interest and dividends we earn on our investments and the on-going cash flows from new and existing business.   See “AFS Securities – Evaluation for Recovery of Amortized Cost” in Note 1 in our 2010 Form 10-K and Note 5 for additional discussion.   As of June 30, 2011, and December 31, 2010, the estimated fair value for all private securities was $8.8 billion and $8.4 billion, both representing approximately 10% of total invested assets.   For information regarding our VIEs’ fixed maturity securities, see Note 4 in both this report and in our 2010 Form 10-K.   MBS (Included in AFS and Trading Securities)   Our fixed maturity securities include MBS. These securities are subject to risks associated with variable prepayments. This may result in differences between the actual cash flow and maturity of these securities than that expected at the time of purchase. Securities that have an amortized cost greater than par and are backed by mortgages that prepay faster than expected will incur a reduction in yield or a loss. Those securities with an amortized cost lower than par that prepay faster than expected will generate an increase in yield or a gain. In addition, we may incur reinvestment risks if market yields are lower than the book yields earned on the securities. Prepayments occurring slower than expected have the opposite effect. We may incur reinvestment risks if market yields are higher than the book yields earned on the securities and we are forced to sell the securities. The degree to which a security is susceptible to either gains or losses is influenced by: the difference between its amortized cost and par; the relative sensitivity of the underlying mortgages backing the assets to prepayment in a changing interest rate environment; and the repayment priority of the securities in the overall securitization structure.   We limit the extent of our risk on MBS by prudently limiting exposure to the asset class, by generally avoiding the purchase of securities with a cost that significantly exceeds par, by purchasing securities backed by stable collateral and by concentrating on securities with enhanced priority in their trust structure. Such securities with reduced risk typically have a lower yield (but higher liquidity) than higher-risk MBS. At selected times, higher-risk securities may be purchased if they do not compromise the safety of the general portfolio. As of June 30, 2011, we did not have a significant amount of higher-risk, trust structured MBS. A significant amount of assets in our MBS portfolio are either guaranteed by U.S. government-sponsored enterprises or are supported in the securitization structure by junior securities enabling the assets to achieve high investment grade status.   Our exposure to subprime mortgage lending is limited to investments in banks and other financial institutions that may be affected by subprime lending and direct investments in ABS CDOs, ABS and RMBS. Mortgage-related ABS are backed by home equity loans and RMBS are backed by residential mortgages. These securities are backed by loans that are characterized by borrowers of differing levels of creditworthiness: prime; Alt-A; and subprime. Prime lending is the origination of residential mortgage loans to customers with excellent credit profiles. Alt-A lending is the origination of residential mortgage loans to customers who have prime credit profiles but lack documentation to substantiate income. Subprime lending is the origination of loans to customers with weak or impaired credit profiles.   The slowing U.S. housing market, increased interest rates for non-prime borrowers and relaxed underwriting standards from 2003 to 2007 have led to higher delinquency rates for residential mortgage loans and home equity loans. We expect delinquency rates and loss rates on residential mortgages and home equity loans to increase in the future; however, we continue to expect to receive payments in accordance with contractual terms for a significant amount of our securities, largely due to the seniority of the claims        105           on the collateral of the securities that we own. The tranches of the securities will experience losses according to their seniority level with the least senior (or most junior), typically the unrated residual tranche, taking the initial loss. The credit ratings of our securities reflect the seniority of the securities that we own. Our RMBS had a market value of $8.8 billion and an unrealized gain of $260 million, or 3%, as of June 30, 2011.   The market value of AFS securities and trading securities backed by subprime loans was $481 million and represented less than 1% of our total investment portfolio as of June 30, 2011. AFS securities represented $465 million, or 97%, and trading securities represented $16 million, or 3%, of the subprime exposure as of June 30, 2011. AFS securities and trading securities rated A or above represented 46% of the subprime investments and $239 million in market value of our subprime investments was backed by loans originating in 2005 and forward.

Monoline insurers provide guarantees on debt for issuers, often in the form of credit wraps, which enhance the credit of the issuer. Monoline insurers guarantee the timely repayment of bond principal and interest when a bond issuer defaults and generally provide credit enhancement for bond issues such as municipal bonds and private placements as well as other types and structures of securities. Our direct exposure represents our bond holdings of the actual Monoline insurers. Our insured bonds represent our holdings in bonds of other issuers that are insured by Monoline insurers.          109           The following summarizes our exposure to Monoline insurers (in millions):                     As of June 30, 2011                                                                        Total                                                            Total       Total       Unrealized       Total                  Direct       Insured       Amortized       Unrealized       Loss       Fair                  Exposure       Bonds (1)       Cost       Gain       and OTTI       Value    Monoline Name                                                                              AMBAC       $    -            $    225        $    225        $    4        $    38        $    191     ASSURED GUARANTY LTD            30                 -             30             -             16             14     FGIC            -                 75             75             1             16             60     FSA            -                 39             39             1             1             39     MBIA            12                 131             143             14             11             146     MGIC            -                 5             5             -             1             4     PMI GROUP INC            24                 -             24             -             11             13     XL CAPITAL LTD            72                 61             133             2             9             126         Total by Monoline insurer (2)       $    138            $    536        $    674        $    22        $    103        $    593                                                                                              Total AFS securities                                 $    68,066        $    4,665        $    1,074        $    71,657                                                                                              Total by Monoline insurer as a                                                                                   percentage of total AFS securities                                     1.0%           0.5%           9.6%           0.8%          (1)    Additional indirect insured exposure through structured securities is excluded from this table.

The $31 million in trading securities consisted of $11 million of direct exposure and $20 million of insured exposure. This table also excludes insured exposure totaling $9 million for a guaranteed investment tax credit partnership.      Additional Details on our Unrealized Losses on AFS Securities   When considering unrealized gain and loss information, it is important to recognize that the information relates to the status of securities at a particular point in time and may not be indicative of the status of our investment portfolios subsequent to the balance sheet date. Further, because the timing of the recognition of realized investment gains and losses through the selection of which securities are sold is largely at management’s discretion, it is important to consider the information provided below within the context of the overall unrealized gain or loss position of our investment portfolios. These are important considerations that should be included in any evaluation of the potential effect of unrealized loss securities on our future earnings.          110           We have no concentrations of issuers or guarantors of fixed maturity and equity securities. We conduct enhanced analysis and monitoring for potential changes in unrealized loss status of securities that we believe are most at risk of impairment.

conditions experienced a period of extreme volatility and disruption that began in the second half of 2007 and continued and substantially increased throughout 2008 that led to a decrease in the overall liquidity and availability of capital in the mortgage loan market, and in particular a decrease in activity by securitization lenders. These conditions and the overall economic downturn put pressure on the fundamentals of mortgage loans on real estate through rising vacancies, falling rents and falling property values.   See Note 5 for information regarding our loan-to-value and debt-service coverage ratios.   There were ten and nine impaired mortgage loans on real estate, or less than 1% of the total dollar amount of mortgage loans on real estate as of June 30, 2011, and December 31, 2010, respectively. The carrying value on the mortgage loans on real estate that were two or more payments delinquent as of June 30, 2011, was $62 million, or 1% of total mortgage loans on real estate. The total principal and interest past due on the mortgage loans on real estate that were two or more payments delinquent as of June 30, 2011, was $43 million. The carrying value on the mortgage loans on real estate that were two or more payments delinquent as of December 31, 2010, was $48 million, or 1% of total mortgage loans on real estate. The total principal and interest past due on the mortgage loans on real estate that were two or more payments delinquent as of December 31, 2010, was $5 million. See Note 1 in our 2010 Form 10-K for more information regarding our accounting policy relating to the impairment of mortgage loans on real estate.   Alternative Investments   The carrying value of our consolidated alternative investments by business segment (in millions), which consisted primarily of investments in limited partnerships, was as follows:                           As of           As of                            June 30,   December 31,                            2011            2010             Retirement Solutions:                                            Annuities       $    121            $    95                 Defined Contribution            75                 71             Insurance Solutions:                                            Life Insurance            585                 546                 Group Protection            35                 30             Other Operations            (16)                8                     Total alternative investments       $    800            $    750                      117           Income (loss) derived from our consolidated alternative investments by business segment (in millions) was as follows:                                 For the Three               For the Six                                      Months Ended               Months Ended                                      June 30,               June 30,                                      2011        2010        Change       2011        2010        Change    Retirement Solutions:                                                                     Annuities   $    4        $    3        33%       $    9        $    6        50%        Defined Contribution         2             2        0%            6             4        50%    Insurance Solutions:                                                                    Life Insurance        27             18        50%            57             32        78%        Group Protection        1             1        0%            3             2        50%    Other Operations        (1)            -        NM            -             -        NM            Total alternative investments (1)   $    33        $    24        38%       $    75        $    44        70%          (1)    Includes net investment income on the alternative investments supporting the required statutory surplus of our insurance businesses.      The increase in our investment income on alternative investments presented in the table above when comparing the first six months of 2011 to the same period in 2010 was due primarily to the overall improvement in the economic environment specifically benefiting our hedge fund and energy limited partnership holdings, as well as increased commodity prices specifically benefiting our energy limited partnership holdings.   As of June 30, 2011, and December 31, 2010, alternative investments included investments in approximately 97 and 95 different partnerships, respectively, and the portfolio represented less than 1% of our overall invested assets. The partnerships do not represent off-balance sheet financing and generally involve several third-party partners. Some of our partnerships contain capital calls, which require us to contribute capital upon notification by the general partner. These capital calls are contemplated during the initial investment decision and are planned for well in advance of the call date. The capital calls are not material in size and are not material to our liquidity. Alternative investments are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and are included in other investments on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.   As discussed in “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Investments – Valuation of Alternative Investments” in our 2010 Form 10-K, we update the carrying value of our alternative investment portfolio whenever audited financial statements of the investees for the preceding year become available. Net investment income (loss) derived from our consolidated alternative investments by segment (in millions) related to the effect of preceding year audit adjustments recorded during the indicated year at the investee was as follows:                       For the Three               For the Six                            Months Ended               Months Ended                            June 30,               June 30,                            2011        2010        Change       2011        2010        Change    Retirement Solutions:                                                                    Annuities   $    1        $    1        0%       $    4        $    3        33%        Defined Contribution        -             1        -100%            2             1        100%    Insurance Solutions:                                                                    Life Insurance        9             4        125%            30             14        114%        Group Protection        -             1        -100%            2             1        100%            Total   $    10        $    7        43%       $    38        $    19        100%             118           Income (loss), after-tax, derived from our consolidated alternative investments by class (in millions) related to the effect of preceding year audit adjustments recorded during the indicated year at the investee was as follows:                       For the Three               For the Six                            Months Ended               Months Ended                            June 30,               June 30,                            2011        2010        Change       2011        2010        Change    Venture capital   $    10        $    8        25%       $    20        $    14        43%    Real estate        (1)            (1)       0%            (1)            (2)       50%    Oil and gas        1             -        NM            19             7        171%    Associated amortization of DAC,                                                                    VOBA, DSI, and DFEL        (4)            (2)       -100%            (13)            (6)       NM    Federal income tax expense (benefit)        (2)            (2)       0%            (9)            (5)       -80%            Total   $    4        $    3        33%       $    16        $    8        100%      Non-Income Producing Investments   As of June 30, 2011, and December 31, 2010, the carrying amount of fixed maturity securities, mortgage loans on real estate and real estate that were non-income producing was $15 million and $17 million, respectively.

The profitability of our fixed annuity and life insurance products is affected by our ability to achieve target spreads, or margins, between the interest income earned on the general account assets and the interest credited to the contract holder on our average fixed account values, including the fixed portion of variable. Net investment income and the interest rate yield table each include commercial mortgage loan prepayments and bond makewhole premiums, alternative investments and contingent interest and standby real estate equity commitments. These items can vary significantly from period to period due to a number of factors and therefore can provide results that are not indicative of the underlying trends.   The increase in net investment income when comparing six months ended June 30, 2011, to the same period of 2010 was attributable to more favorable investment income on surplus and alternative investments, higher prepayment and bond makewhole premiums (see “Alternative Investments” above and “Commercial Mortgage Loan Prepayment and Bond Makewhole Premiums” below for more information) and higher invested assets driven primarily by favorable net flows on fixed account values, including the fixed portion of variable and to a lesser extent issuances of common stock and debt.   Standby Real Estate Equity Commitments   Historically, we have entered into standby commitments, which obligated us to purchase real estate at a specified cost if a third-party sale does not occur within approximately one year after construction is completed. These commitments were used by a developer to obtain a construction loan from an outside lender on favorable terms. In return for issuing the commitment, we received an annual fee and a percentage of the profit when the property is sold. During 2009, we suspended the practice of entering into new standby real estate commitments.    As of June 30, 2011, we did not have any standby real estate equity commitments. During the first six months of 2011, we funded commitments of $19 million and recorded a gain of $6 million due to our funding being less than our estimated allowance for loss related to these commitments.   Commercial Mortgage Loan Prepayment and Bond Makewhole Premiums   Prepayment and makewhole premiums are collected when borrowers elect to call or prepay their debt prior to the stated maturity. A prepayment or makewhole premium allows investors to attain the same yield as if the borrower made all scheduled interest payments until maturity. These premiums are designed to make investors indifferent to prepayment.        120             The increase in prepayment and makewhole premiums when comparing 2011 to 2010 was attributable primarily to a decline in interest rates coupled with improvements in the capital markets and real estate financing environment, which resulted in more refinancing activity and more prepayment income.

When actual credit-related investment losses are realized, we recognize a true-up to our DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL amortization and changes in other contract holder funds within realized loss reflecting the incremental effect of actual versus expected credit-related investment losses. These actual to expected amortization adjustments could create volatility in net realized gains and losses. The write-down for impairments includes both credit-related and interest-rate related impairments.   Realized gains and losses generally originate from asset sales to reposition the portfolio or to respond to product experience. During the first six months of 2011 and 2010, we sold securities for gains and losses. In the process of evaluating whether a security with an unrealized loss reflects declines that are other-than-temporary, we consider our ability and intent to sell the security prior to a recovery of value. However, subsequent decisions on securities sales are made within the context of overall risk monitoring, assessing value relative to other comparable securities and overall portfolio maintenance. Although our portfolio managers may, at a given point in time, believe that the preferred course of action is to hold securities with unrealized losses that are considered temporary until such losses are recovered, the dynamic nature of portfolio management may result in a subsequent decision to sell. These subsequent decisions are consistent with the classification of our investment portfolio as AFS. We expect to continue to manage all non-trading invested assets within our portfolios in a manner that is consistent with the AFS classification.   We consider economic factors and circumstances within countries and industries where recent write-downs have occurred in our assessment of the status of securities we own of similarly situated issuers. While it is possible for realized or unrealized losses on a particular investment to affect other investments, our risk management has been designed to identify correlation risks and other risks inherent in managing an investment portfolio. Once identified, strategies and procedures are developed to effectively monitor and manage these risks. The areas of risk correlation that we pay particular attention to are risks that may be correlated within specific financial and business markets, risks within specific industries and risks associated with related parties.   When the detailed analysis by our credit analysts and investment portfolio managers leads us to the conclusion that a security’s decline in fair value is other-than-temporary, the security is written down to estimated recovery value. In instances where declines are considered temporary, the security will continue to be carefully monitored. See “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” in our 2010 Form 10-K for additional information on our portfolio management strategy.          121           Details underlying write-downs taken as a result of OTTI (in millions) were as follows:                                   For the Three               For the Six                                        Months Ended               Months Ended                                        June 30,               June 30,                                        2011        2010        Change       2011        2010        Change    Fixed Maturity Securities                                                                Corporate bonds   $    (2)       $    (5)       60%       $    (6)       $    (46)       87%    MBS:                                                                    CMOs        (23)            (12)       -92%            (43)            (36)       -19%        CMBS        (15)            -        NM            (39)            -        NM    ABS CDOs        -             -        NM            (1)            (1)       0%    Hybrid and redeemable preferred                                                                    securities        -             -        NM            (2)            (5)       60%            Total fixed maturity securities        (40)            (17)       NM            (91)            (88)       -3%                                                                                             Equity Securities                                                                Other financial services securities        -             -        NM            -             (3)       100%            Total equity securities        -             -        NM            -             (3)       100%                Gross OTTI recognized in net                                                                                income (loss)        (40)            (17)       NM            (91)            (91)       0%                Associated amortization of DAC,                                                                                VOBA, DSI and DFEL        10             6        67%            22             27        -19%                        Net OTTI recognized in net                                                                                         income (loss), pre-tax   $    (30)       $    (11)       NM       $    (69)       $    (64)       -8%                                                                                             Portion of OTTI Recognized in OCI                                                                Gross OTTI recognized in OCI   $    18        $    -        NM       $    27        $    22        23%    Change in DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL        (3)            -        NM            (6)            2        NM        Net portion of OTTI recognized in                                                                        OCI, pre-tax   $    15        $    -        NM       $    21        $    24        -13%      During the three months ended June 30, 2011, we experienced an increase in write-downs for OTTI on our AFS MBS attributable primarily to continued weakness within the commercial and residential real estate market that affected select RMBS and CMBS holdings. For the remaining AFS securities, when comparing the first six months of 2011 to the same period in 2010, the decrease in write-downs for OTTI was attributable primarily to overall improvement in the credit markets as compared to the same period in the prior year.   The $118 million of impairments taken during the first six months of 2011 were split between $91 million of credit related impairments and $27 million of non-credit related impairments. The credit related impairments were largely attributable to our RMBS and CMBS holdings primarily as a result of continued weakness within the commercial and residential real estate market that affected select RMBS and CMBS holdings. The non-credit related impairments were incurred due to declines in values of securities for which we do not have an intent to sell or it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the securities before recovery.   REVIEW OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION   Liquidity and Capital Resources   Sources of Liquidity and Cash Flow   Liquidity refers to the ability of an enterprise to generate adequate amounts of cash from its normal operations to meet cash requirements with a prudent margin of safety. Our principal sources of cash flow from operating activities are insurance premiums and fees and investment income, while sources of cash flows from investing activities result from maturities and sales of invested assets. Our operating activities provided cash of $878 million and $873 million for the first six months of 2011 and 2010,        122           respectively. When considering our liquidity and cash flow, it is important to distinguish between the needs of our insurance subsidiaries and the needs of the holding company, LNC. As a holding company with no operations of its own, LNC derives its cash primarily from its operating subsidiaries.   The sources of liquidity of the holding company are principally comprised of dividends and interest payments from subsidiaries, augmented by holding company short-term investments, bank lines of credit and the ongoing availability of long-term public financing under an SEC-filed shelf registration statement. These sources of liquidity and cash flow support the general corporate needs of the holding company, including its common and preferred stock dividends, interest and debt service, funding of callable securities, securities repurchases, acquisitions and investment in core businesses. Our cash flows associated with collateral received from and posted with counterparties change as the market value of the underlying derivative contract changes. As the value of a derivative asset declines (or increases), the collateral required to be posted by our counterparties would also decline (or increase). Likewise, when the value of a derivative liability declines (or increases), the collateral we are required to post for our counterparties’ benefit would also decline (or increase). During the first six months of 2011, our payables for collateral on derivative investments increased by $224 million, which was attributable primarily to increased notional amounts. For additional information, see “Credit Risk” in Note 6.

For more information, see Note 3.        (2)    Primarily represents interest on the holding company’s $1.3 billion in surplus note investments in LNL.      The table above focuses on significant and recurring cash flow items and excludes the effects of certain financing activities, namely the periodic issuance and retirement of debt and cash flows related to our inter-company cash management program (discussed below). Taxes have been eliminated from the analysis due to a tax sharing agreement among our primary subsidiaries resulting in a modest effect on net cash flows at the holding company. Also excluded from this analysis is the modest amount of investment income on short-term investments of the holding company.   Subsidiaries’ Statutory Reserving and Surplus   For discussion of our strategies to lessen the burden of increased AG38 and XXX statutory reserves associated with certain UL products and other products with secondary guarantees subject to these statutory reserving requirements on our insurance subsidiaries, see “Results of Insurance Solutions – Insurance Solutions – Life Insurance – Income (Loss) from Operations – Strategies to Address Statutory Reserve Strain.”        123           Financing Activities   Although our subsidiaries currently generate adequate cash flow to meet the needs of our normal operations, periodically we may issue debt or equity securities to maintain ratings and increase liquidity, as well as to fund internal growth, acquisitions and the retirement of our debt and equity securities.   We currently have an effective shelf registration statement, which allows us to issue, in unlimited amounts, securities, including debt securities, preferred stock, common stock, warrants, stock purchase contracts, stock purchase units, depository shares and trust preferred securities of our affiliated trusts.   Details underlying debt and financing activities (in millions) were as follows:                                 For the Six Months Ended June 30, 2011                                                                  Change                                                                              Maturities       in Fair                                                      Beginning                   and       Value       Other       Ending                              Balance       Issuance       Repayments       Hedges       Changes (1)       Balance    Short-Term Debt                                                                        Commercial paper (2)   $    100        $    -        $    -        $    -        $    (100)       $    -     Current maturities of long-term debt (3)        250             -             -             -             -             250     Other short-term debt (4)        1             -             -             -             -             1             Total short-term debt   $    351        $    -        $    -        $    -        $    (100)       $    251                                                                                                    Long-Term Debt                                                                        Senior notes   $    3,464        $    300        $    -        $    28        $    1        $    3,793     Bank borrowing        200             -             -             -             -             200     Federal Home Loan Bank of                                                                            Indianapolis ("FHLBI") advance        250             -             -             -             -             250     Capital securities        1,485             -             -             -             1             1,486             Total long-term debt   $    5,399        $    300        $    -        $    28        $    2        $    5,729           (1)    Includes the net increase (decrease) in commercial paper, non-cash reclassification of long-term debt to current maturities of long-term debt, accretion of discounts and (amortization) of premiums, as applicable.        (2)    During the six months ended June 30, 2011, we had an average of $70 million outstanding, a maximum amount outstanding of $103 million at any time and a weighted average interest rate of 0.39%.        (3)    Consisted of a 6.20% fixed rate senior note that matures in less than one year.        (4)    Consisted of advances from the FHLBI with a maturity of less than one year when made. During the six months ended June 30, 2011, we had an average and maximum amount outstanding of $1 million and a weighted average interest rate of 0.53%.      On June 24, 2011, we completed the issuance and sale of $300 million aggregate principal amount of our 4.85% senior notes due 2021. We used the net proceeds from this offering to redeem $275 million aggregate principal amount of our 6.75% capital securities due 2066 on July 7, 2011, and we expect the remaining net proceeds from this offering will be used for general corporate purposes.   Within the next two years, we have a $250 million 6.20% fixed rate senior note maturing on December 15, 2011, and a $300 million 5.65% fixed rate senior note maturing on August 27, 2012. The specific resources or combination of resources that we will use to meet these maturities will depend upon, among other things, the financial market conditions present at the time of maturity. As of June 30, 2011, the holding company had $1.0 billion in cash and cash equivalents and $25 million invested in fixed maturity corporate bonds; however, as mentioned above, it used $275 million of cash to redeem certain capital securities in July 2011, and as discussed below, it had an $89 million payable under the inter-company cash management program.   We have not accounted for repurchase agreements, securities lending transactions, or other transactions involving the transfer of financial assets with an obligation to repurchase the transferred assets as sales and do have any other transactions involving the transfer of financial assets with an obligation to repurchase the transferred assets. For information about our collateralized financing transactions on our investments, see “Payables for Collateral on Investments” in Note 5.          124           Details underlying our credit facilities with a group of domestic and foreign banks (in millions) were as follows:                             As of June 30, 2011                      Expiration       Maximum     Borrowings   LOCs                      Date       Available      Outstanding      Issued        Credit Facilities                                                Credit facility with the FHLBI (1)   N/A       $    645        $    350        N/A        Four-year revolving credit facility   Jun-2015            2,000             -             693         LOC facility   Mar-2023            828             -             828             Total           $    3,473        $    350        $    1,521               (1)    We are allowed to borrow up to 20 times the amount of our common stock investment in the FHLBI. All borrowings from the FHLBI are required to be secured by certain investments owned by LNL. Our borrowing capacity under this credit facility does not have an expiration date and continues while our investment in the FHLBI common stock remains outstanding as long as LNL maintains a satisfactory level of creditworthiness and does not incur a material adverse change in its financial, business, regulatory or other areas that would materially affect its operations and viability. As of June 30, 2011, we had a $250 million floating-rate term loan outstanding under the facility (classified within long-term debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheets) due June 20, 2017, which may be prepaid on four specified reset dates. We also borrowed $100 million under the facility (classified within payables for collateral on investments on our Consolidated Balance Sheets) at a rate of 0.25% that is due August 31, 2011.      Effective as of June 10, 2011, we entered into a credit agreement with a syndicate of banks. This agreement (the “credit facility”) allows for any combination of issuance of LOCs and borrowing of up to $2.0 billion; however, only $1.0 billion of the borrowing is available to reimburse the banks for drawn LOCs. The credit facility is unsecured and has a commitment termination date of June 10, 2015. LOCs issued under the credit facility may remain outstanding for one year following the applicable commitment termination date of the agreement. The LOCs support inter-company reinsurance transactions and specific treaties associated with our business sold through reinsurance. LOCs are used primarily to satisfy the U.S. regulatory requirements of our domestic insurance companies for which reserve credit is provided by our affiliated reinsurance companies, as discussed above in “Insurance Solutions – Life Insurance – Strategies to Address Statutory Reserve Strain,” and our domestic clients of the business sold through reinsurance.   The credit facility contains customary terms and conditions, including covenants restricting our ability to incur liens, merge or consolidate with another entity where we are not the surviving entity and dispose of all or substantially all of our assets. The credit facility also includes financial covenants including: maintenance of a minimum consolidated net worth (as defined in the facility) equal to the sum of $9.2 billion plus fifty percent (50%) of the aggregate net proceeds of equity issuances received by us in accordance with the terms of the credit facility; and a debt-to-capital ratio as defined in accordance with the credit facility not to exceed 0.35 to 1.00. Further, the credit facility contains customary events of default, subject to certain materiality thresholds and grace periods for certain of those events of default. The events of default include payment defaults, covenant defaults, material inaccuracies in representations and warranties, certain cross-defaults, bankruptcy and liquidation proceedings and other customary defaults. Upon an event of default, the credit facility provides that, among other things, the commitments may be terminated and the loans then outstanding may be declared due and payable. As of June 30, 2011, we were in compliance with all such covenants.   This credit facility replaced our existing four-year credit facility dated as of June 9, 2010, and set to expire June 9, 2014, and the commitments under the existing credit facility have been terminated. Our 364-day credit facility expired June 8, 2011, prior to entering into the new credit agreement.   On April 28, 2011, certain of our wholly-owned subsidiaries amended and restated the reimbursement agreement (the “reimbursement agreement”) entered into on December 31, 2009, with a third-party lender. Under the amended agreement, the lender issued an irrevocable LOC effective April 1, 2011, with a maximum scheduled LOC amount of up to approximately $925 million. The LOC supports an inter-company reinsurance agreement and expires March 31, 2023. The reimbursement agreement contains customary terms and conditions, including covenants restricting the ability of those subsidiaries to incur liens, merge or consolidate with another entity and dispose of all or substantially all of their assets. Further, the reimbursement agreement contains customary events of default, subject to certain materiality thresholds and grace periods for certain of those events of default. The events of default include payment defaults, covenant defaults, material inaccuracies in representations and warranties, bankruptcy and liquidation proceedings and other customary defaults. Upon an event of default, the reimbursement agreement provides that, among other things, obligations to issue, amend or increase the amount of any LOC shall be terminated and any obligations shall become immediately due and payable. As of June 30, 2011, we were in compliance with all such covenants.        125             See “Part II – Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Review of Consolidated Financial Condition – Liquidity and Capital Resources – Financing Activities” in our 2010 Form 10-K for additional information on our credit facilities.   If current debt ratings and claims-paying ratings were downgraded in the future, terms in our derivative agreements may be triggered, which could negatively affect overall liquidity. For the majority of our counterparties, there is a termination event should the long-term senior debt ratings of LNC drop below BBB-/Baa3 (S&P/Moody’s). Our long-term senior debt held a rating of A-/Baa2 (S&P/Moody’s) as of June 30, 2011. In addition, contractual selling agreements with intermediaries could be negatively affected, which could have an adverse effect on overall sales of annuities, life insurance and investment products. See “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors – A decrease in the capital and surplus of our insurance subsidiaries may result in a downgrade to our credit and insurer financial strength ratings” and “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors – A downgrade in our financial strength or credit ratings could limit our ability to market products, increase the number or value of policies being surrendered and/or hurt our relationships with creditors” in our 2010 Form 10-K for more information. See “Part I – Item 1. Business – Ratings” in our 2010 Form 10-K for additional information on our current bond ratings.    Alternative Sources of Liquidity    In order to manage our capital more efficiently, we have an inter-company cash management program where certain subsidiaries can lend to or borrow from the holding company to meet short-term borrowing needs. The cash management program is essentially a series of demand loans, which are permitted under applicable insurance laws, among LNC and its affiliates that reduces overall borrowing costs by allowing LNC and its subsidiaries to access internal resources instead of incurring third-party transaction costs. For our Indiana-domiciled insurance subsidiaries, the borrowing and lending limit is currently the lesser of 3% of the insurance company’s admitted assets and 25% of its surplus, in both cases, as of its most recent year end.   The holding company did not borrow from the cash management program during the second quarter of 2011. There was no balance as of June 30, 2011. In addition, the holding company had an outstanding payable of $89 million to certain subsidiaries resulting from amounts placed by the subsidiaries in the inter-company cash management account in excess of funds borrowed by those subsidiaries as of June 30, 2011. Any increase (decrease) in either of these holding company cash management program payable balances results in an immediate and equal increase (decrease) to holding company cash and cash equivalents.   Our insurance subsidiaries, by virtue of their general account fixed income investment holdings, can access liquidity through securities lending programs and repurchase agreements. As of June 30, 2011, our insurance subsidiaries had securities with a carrying value of $200 million out on loan under the securities lending program and $280 million carrying value subject to reverse-repurchase agreements. The cash received in our securities lending program is typically invested in cash equivalents, short-term investments or fixed maturity securities.   For factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in this section, see “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2010 Form 10-K and “Forward-Looking Statements – Cautionary Language” above.   Divestitures   For a discussion of our divestitures, see Note 3.   Uses of Capital   Our principal uses of cash are to pay policy claims and benefits, operating expenses, commissions and taxes, to purchase new investments, to purchase reinsurance, to fund policy surrenders and withdrawals, to pay dividends to our stockholders and to repurchase our stock and debt securities.   Return of Capital to Common Stockholders   One of the Company’s primary goals is to provide a return to our common stockholders through share price accretion, dividends and stock repurchases. We expect to repurchase additional shares of common stock over the remainder of 2011 depending on market conditions and alternative uses of capital. The amount and timing of share repurchase depends on key capital ratios, rating agency expectations, the generation of free cash flow and an evaluation of the costs and benefits associated with alternative uses of capital. In determining dividends, the Board takes into consideration items such as current and expected earnings, capital needs, rating agency considerations and requirements for financial flexibility.          126           Details underlying this activity (in millions, except per share data), were as follows:                               For the Three               For the Six                                    Months Ended               Months Ended                                    June 30,               June 30,                                    2011        2010        Change       2011        2010        Change    Common dividends to stockholders   $    16        $    3        NM       $    31        $    6        NM    Repurchase of common stock        151             -        NM            226             -        NM            Total cash returned to stockholders   $    167        $    3        NM       $    257        $    6        NM                                                                                         Number of shares issued        -             14.138        -100%            -             14.138        -100%    Average price per share   $    -        $    26.09        -100%       $    -        $    26.09        -100%                                                                     Number of shares repurchased        5.149             -        NM            7.563             -        NM    Average price per share   $    29.15        $    -        NM       $    29.77        $    -        NM      Note: Average price per share is calculated using whole dollars instead of dollars rounded to millions.   Other Uses of Capital   In addition to the amounts in the table above in “Return of Capital to Common Stockholders,” other users of holding company cash flow (in millions) were as follows:               For the Three               For the Six                    Months Ended               Months Ended                    June 30,               June 30,                    2011        2010        Change       2011        2010        Change    Debt service (interest paid)   $    80        $    72        11%       $    142        $    130        9%    Capital contribution to subsidiaries        8             -        NM            16             18        -11%        Total   $    88        $    72        22%       $    158        $    148        7%      The above table focuses on significant and recurring cash flow items and excludes the effects of certain financing activities, namely the periodic retirement of debt and cash flows related to our inter-company cash management account. Taxes have been eliminated from the analysis due to a tax sharing agreement among our primary subsidiaries resulting in a modest effect on net cash flows at the holding company.   Significant Trends in Sources and Uses of Cash Flow   As stated above, LNC’s cash flow, as a holding company, is largely dependent upon the dividend capacity of its insurance company subsidiaries as well as their ability to advance funds to it through inter-company borrowing arrangements, which may be affected by factors influencing the insurance subsidiaries’ RBC and statutory earnings performance. We currently expect to be able to meet the holding company’s ongoing cash needs and to have sufficient capital to offer downside protection in the event that the capital and credit markets experience another period of extreme volatility and disruption. A decline in capital market conditions, which reduces our insurance subsidiaries’ statutory surplus and RBC, may require them to retain more capital and may pressure our subsidiaries’ dividends to the holding company, which may lead us to take steps to preserve or raise additional capital. For factors that could affect our expectations for liquidity and capital, see “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2010 Form 10-K.   OTHER MATTERS   Other Factors Affecting Our Business   In general, our businesses are subject to a changing social, economic, legal, legislative and regulatory environment. Some of the changes include initiatives to require more reserves to be carried by our insurance subsidiaries. Although the eventual effect on us of the changing environment in which we operate remains uncertain, these factors and others could have a material effect on our results of operations, liquidity and capital resources. For factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in this section, see “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2010 Form 10-K and “Forward-Looking Statements – Cautionary Language” above.        127             Recent Accounting Pronouncements   See Note 2 for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements that have been implemented during the periods presented or that have been issued and are to be implemented in the future.   Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk   We analyze and manage the risks arising from market exposures of financial instruments, as well as other risks, in an integrated asset-liability management process that takes diversification into account. By aggregating the potential effect of market and other risks on the entire enterprise, we estimate, review and in some cases manage the risk to our earnings and shareholder value. We have exposures to several market risks including interest rate risk, foreign currency exchange risk, equity market risk, default risk, basis risk and credit risk. The exposures of financial instruments to market risks, and the related risk management process, are most important to our Retirement Solutions and Insurance Solutions businesses, where most of the invested assets support accumulation and investment-oriented insurance products. As an important element of our integrated asset-liability management process, we use derivatives to minimize the effects of changes in interest levels, the shape of the yield curve, currency movements and volatility. In this context, derivatives are designated as a hedge and serve to minimize interest rate risk by mitigating the effect of significant increases in interest rates on our earnings. Additional market exposures exist in our other general account insurance products and in our debt structure and derivatives positions. Our primary sources of market risk are: substantial, relatively rapid and sustained increases or decreases in interest rates; fluctuations in currency exchange rates; or a sharp drop in equity market values. These market risks are discussed in detail in the following pages and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements (“Notes”) presented in “Item 1. Financial Statements,” as well as “Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”).”   Interest Rate Risk    Interest Rate Risk on Fixed Insurance Businesses – Falling Rates   In periods of declining interest rates, we have to reinvest the cash we receive as interest or return of principal on our investments in lower yielding instruments. Moreover, borrowers may prepay fixed income securities, commercial mortgages and mortgage-backed securities in our general accounts in order to borrow at lower market rates, which exacerbate this risk. Because we are entitled to reset the interest rates on our fixed rate annuities only at limited, pre-established intervals, and because many of our contracts have guaranteed minimum interest or crediting rates, our spreads could decrease and potentially become negative.   Prolonged historically low rates are not healthy for our business fundamentals. However, we have recognized this threat and have been proactive in our investment strategies, product designs, crediting rate strategies and overall asset-liability practices to mitigate the risk of unfavorable consequences in this type of environment. For some time now, new products have been sold with low minimum crediting floors, and we apply disciplined asset-liability management standards, such as locking in spreads on these products at the time of issue.   The following summarizes solely a hypothetical significant unfavorable stress scenario to earnings if new money rates, currently averaging approximately 75 to 100 basis points below our portfolio yields, remain in place through 2013 as opposed to a scenario that we would expect to occur. This scenario is simply an illustration of the sensitivity to our earnings if such a stress scenario were to happen:       ·    Insurance Solutions – Life Insurance – The stress on earnings has been mitigated by proactive strategies to lock-in long-dated and high-yielding assets to manage this risk. We executed on strategies which allowed us to effectively pre-buy assets in anticipation of future flows and maturing securities. We have also taken actions on crediting rates. We estimate that this scenario would have an approximate unfavorable earnings effect in a range of $0 to $5 million during 2011, $10 million to $15 million during 2012 and $20 million to $25 million during 2013. Our deferred acquisition costs (“DAC”), value of business acquired (“VOBA”), and deferred front-end loads (“DFEL”) methodology assumes that new money rates grade from current levels to a long-term yield assumption over time. During the third quarter of 2010, we lowered our new money investment yield assumption to reflect the then current new money rates and to approximate the forward curve for interest rates relevant at such time. The result was a drop in the current new money investment rate followed by a gradual annual recovery over eight years to a rate of 6.31%, 54 basis points below our previous ultimate long-term assumption of 6.85%. As a result, we recorded a prospective unlocking, as discussed in “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL” and “Results of Insurance Solutions – Life Insurance” in the MD&A.        ·    Retirement Solutions – The earnings drag from spread compression is modest and largely concentrated in our Defined Contribution segment, which is a function of this segment having higher guaranteed crediting rates and recurring premiums. We estimate that this scenario would have an approximate unfavorable earnings effect in a range of $0 to $5 million during the remainder of 2011, $5 million to $10 million during 2012 and $10 million to $15 million during 2013. Since we currently have the ability to manage spread compression through credit rate actions, our Annuities business is not currently sensitive to spread compression so there is very little effect estimated. The risk for our Annuities business is sensitivity to sharp rising rates and we manage this risk by selling market value adjusted product and through purchase of derivative protection.           128               ·    Insurance Solutions – Group Protection – We reviewed the discount rate assumptions associated with our long-term disability claim reserves and life waiver claim incurrals during the second quarter of 2011, which resulted in lowering the discount rate by 50 basis points and decreasing income from operations by $3 million. Spread compression would unfavorably affect annualized earnings by up to $5 million during 2012.        ·    Other Operations – We may also be affected by sensitivity to our exposures in our institutional pension and disability run-off blocks of business that are sensitive to interest rates and could contribute to an effect.      The estimates above are based upon a hypothetical stressed scenario and are only representative of the effects of new money rates remaining in place through 2013 keeping all else equal and does not give consideration to the aggregate effect of other factors, including but not limited to: contract holder activity; hedge positions; changing equity markets; shifts in implied volatilities; and changes in other capital markets. In addition, the scenario only illustrated the effect to spreads and certain unlocking and reserve changes. Minimum guaranteed rates on annuity and universal life (“UL”) policies generally range from 0.6% to 5.0%. Other potential effects of the scenario were not considered in the analysis. See “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors – Changes in interest rates and sustained low interest rates may cause interest rate spreads to decrease and changes in interest rates may also result in increased contract withdrawals” in our 2010 Form 10-K for additional information on interest rates.          129           The following provides detail on the percentage differences between the June 30, 2011, interest rates being credited to contract holders based on second quarter of 2011 declared rates and the respective minimum guaranteed policy rate (dollars in millions), broken out by contract holder account values reported within the Retirement Solutions and Insurance Solutions businesses:                                 Account Values                                                      Insurance                                                  Retirement Solutions       Solutions -                   %                                          Defined       Life                   Account                            Annuities       Contribution      Insurance (1)      Total       Values    Excess of Crediting Rates over Contract Minimums                                                        Discretionary rate setting products (2)(3)                                                            No difference   $    5,444        $    8,917        $    24,050        $    38,411        61.0%        up to 0.10%        25             -             555             580        0.9%        0.11% to 0.20%        26             11             154             191        0.3%        0.21% to 0.30%        70             2             186             258        0.4%        0.31% to 0.40%        33             193             393             619        1.0%        0.41% to 0.50%        58             -             695             753        1.2%        0.51% to 0.60%        117             -             730             847        1.3%        0.61% to 0.70%        128             65             491             684        1.1%        0.71% to 0.80%        117             -             307             424        0.7%        0.81% to 0.90%        85             -             276             361        0.6%        0.91% to 1.00%        66             133             154             353        0.6%        1.01% to 1.50%        417             85             444             946        1.5%        1.51% to 2.00%        110             7             50             167        0.3%        2.01% to 2.50%        59             173             -             232        0.4%        2.51% to 3.00%        10             15             88             113        0.2%        3.01% and above        4             1             -             5        0.0%            Total discretionary rate setting products         6,769             9,602             28,573             44,944        71.5%    Other contracts (4)        14,455             3,423             -             17,878        28.5%                Total account values   $    21,224        $    13,025        $    28,573        $    62,822        100.0%                                                                                   Percentage of discretionary rate setting product account                                                            values at minimum guaranteed rates       80.4%           92.9%           84.2%           85.5%                  (1)    Excludes policy loans.        (2)    Contracts currently within new money rate bands are grouped according to the corresponding portfolio rate band in which they will fall upon their first anniversary.        (3)    The average crediting rates in excess of average minimum guaranteed rates for our Annuities, Defined Contribution and Life Insurance segments were 19 basis points, 9 basis points and 11 basis points, respectively.        (4)    Includes multi-year guarantee annuities, indexed annuities, modified guarantee annuities, single premium immediate annuities, dollar cost averaging contracts and indexed-based rate setting products for our Defined Contribution segment. The average crediting rates in excess of average minimum guaranteed rates for indexed-based rate setting products within our Defined Contribution segment was 20 basis points, and 63% of account values were already at their minimum guaranteed rates.      The maturity structure and call provisions of the related portfolios are structured to afford protection against erosion of investment portfolio yields during periods of declining interest rates. We devote extensive effort to evaluating the risks associated with falling interest rates by simulating asset and liability cash flows for a wide range of interest rate scenarios. We seek to manage these exposures by maintaining a suitable maturity structure and by limiting our exposure to call risk in each respective investment portfolio.   Derivatives   We have entered into derivative transactions to hedge our exposure to rapid changes in interest rates. The derivative programs are used to help us achieve somewhat stable margins while providing competitive crediting rates to contract holders during periods when interest rates are changing. Such derivatives include interest rate swap agreements, interest rate futures, interest rate cap        130           agreements, forward-starting interest rate swaps, consumer price index swaps, interest rate cap corridors and treasury locks. See Note 6 for additional information on our derivatives used to hedge our exposure to changes in interest rates.   In addition to continuing existing programs, we may use derivative instruments in other strategies to limit risk and enhance returns, particularly in the management of investment spread businesses. We have established policies, guidelines and internal control procedures for the use of derivatives as tools to enhance management of the overall portfolio of risks assumed in our operations. Annually, our Board of Directors reviews our derivatives policy.   Equity Market Risk   Effect of Equity Market Sensitivity   Due to the use of our reversion to the mean (“RTM”) process and our hedging strategies as described in “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” in the MD&A, we expect that, in general, short-term fluctuations in the equity markets should not have a significant effect on our quarterly earnings from unlocking of assumptions for DAC, VOBA, deferred sales inducements (“DSI”) and DFEL, as we do not unlock our long-term equity market assumptions based upon short-term fluctuations in the equity markets. However, there is an effect to earnings from the effects of equity market movements on account values and assets under management and the related asset-based fees we earn on those assets net of related expenses we incur based upon the level of assets.   The following presents our estimate of the effect on income (loss) from operations (in millions), from the change in asset-based fees and related expenses, if the level of the Standard & Poor’s (“S&P”) 500 Index® (“S&P 500”), which ended at 1321 as of June 30, 2011, were to decrease to 1060 over six months after June 30, 2011, and remain at that level through the next six months or increase to 1585 over six months after June 30, 2011, and remain at that level through the next six months, excluding any effect related to sales, prospective unlocking, persistency, hedge program performance or customer behavior caused by the equity market change:           S&P 500       S&P 500            at 1060 (1)       at 1585 (1)        Segment                        Retirement Solutions - Annuities   $    (66)       $    28         Retirement Solutions - Defined Contribution        (6)            10               (1)    The baseline for these effects assumes 9% annual separate account growth beginning on July 1, 2011. The baseline is then compared to scenarios of S&P 500 at the 1060 and 1585 levels, which assume the index moves to those levels over six months, remains at those levels through the next six months and grows at 9% annually thereafter. The difference between the baseline and S&P 500 at the 1060 and 1585 level scenarios is presented in the table.      Refer to “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL” in the MD&A for discussion on the effects of equity markets on our RTM.   The effect on earnings summarized above is an expected effect for the next twelve months. The effect of quarterly equity market changes upon fee revenues and asset-based expenses will not be fully recognized in the current quarter because fee revenues are earned and related expenses are incurred based upon daily variable account values. The difference between the current period average daily variable account values compared to the end of period variable account values affects fee revenues in subsequent periods. Additionally, the effect on earnings may not necessarily be symmetrical with comparable increases in the equity markets. This discussion concerning the estimated effects of ongoing equity market volatility on the fees we earn from account values and assets under management is intended to be illustrative. Actual effects may vary depending on a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control, such as changing customer behaviors that might result in changes in the mix of our business between variable and fixed annuity contracts, switching among investment alternatives available within variable products, changes in sales production levels or changes in policy persistency. For purposes of this guidance, the change in account values is assumed to correlate with the change in the relevant index.    Credit-Related Derivatives   We use credit-related derivatives to minimize our exposure to credit-related events and we also sell credit default swaps to offer credit protection to our contract holders and investors. See Note 6 for additional information.          131           Credit Risk    Through the use of derivative instruments, we are exposed to both credit risk (our counterparty fails to make payment) and market risk (the value of the instrument falls). When the fair value of a derivative contract is positive, this generally indicates that the counterparty owes us and, therefore, creates a credit risk for us equal to the extent of the fair value gain in the derivative. When the fair value of a derivative contract is negative, this generally indicates we owe the counterparty and therefore we have no credit risk, but have been affected by market risk. We minimize the credit risk in derivative instruments by entering into transactions with high quality counterparties with minimum credit ratings that are reviewed regularly by us, by limiting the amount of credit exposure to any one counterparty and by requiring certain counterparties to post collateral if our credit risk exceeds certain limits. We also maintain a policy of requiring all derivative contracts to be governed by an International Swaps and Derivatives Association (“ISDA”) Master Agreement. We do not believe that the credit or market risks associated with derivative instruments are material to any insurance subsidiary or to us. See Note 6 for additional information on our credit risk.   We have derivative positions with counterparties. Assuming zero recovery value, our exposure is the positive market value of the derivative positions with a counterparty, less collateral, that would be lost if the counterparty were to default. As of June 30, 2011, and December 31, 2010, our counterparty risk exposure, net of collateral, was $139 million and $184 million, respectively. As of June 30, 2011, we had exposure to 17 counterparties, with a maximum exposure of $44 million, net of collateral, to a single counterparty. The credit risk associated with such agreements is minimized by purchasing such agreements from financial institutions with long-standing, superior performance records. For the majority of our counterparties, there is a termination event should the long-term senior debt ratings of Lincoln National Corporation drop below BBB-/Baa3 (S&P/Moody’s Investors Service). Additionally, we maintain a policy of requiring all derivative contracts to be governed by an ISDA Master Agreement.   Our fair value of counterparty exposure (in millions) was as follows:                   As of       As of                June 30,   December 31,                    2011            2010             Rating                                        AAA       $    2            $    7             AA            26                 26             A            107                 146             BBB            4                 5                 Total       $    139            $    184               Item 4. Controls and Procedures   Conclusions Regarding Disclosure Controls and Procedures   We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, which are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As of the end of the period required by this report, we, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting them to material information relating to us and our consolidated subsidiaries required to be disclosed in our periodic reports under the Exchange Act.   Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting   There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended June 30, 2011, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.   A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the company have been detected. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to        132           risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.   PART II – OTHER INFORMATION   Item 1.
