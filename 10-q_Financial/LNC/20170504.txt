Item 1A. Risk Factors,” “Part II – Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and “Part II – Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data”; and our current reports on Form 8-K filed in 2017. For more detailed information on the risks and uncertainties associated with the Company’s business activities, see the risks described in “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2016 Form 10-K as updated by “Part II – Item 1A. Risk Factors” below.   ﻿   In this report, in addition to providing consolidated revenues and net income (loss), we also provide segment operating revenues and income (loss) from operations because we believe they are meaningful measures of revenues and the profitability of our operating segments. Financial information that follows is presented in accordance with United States of America generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), unless otherwise indicated. See Note 1 in our 2016 Form 10-K for a discussion of GAAP.   ﻿   Operating revenues and income (loss) from operations are the financial performance measures we use to evaluate and assess the results of our segments. Accordingly, we define and report operating revenues and income (loss) from operations by segment in Note 13. Our management believes that operating revenues and income (loss) from operations explain the results of our ongoing businesses in a manner that allows for a better understanding of the underlying trends in our current businesses because the excluded items are unpredictable and not necessarily indicative of current operating fundamentals or future performance of the business segments, and, in many instances, decisions regarding these items do not necessarily relate to the operations of the individual segments. In addition, we believe that our definitions of operating revenues and income (loss) from operations will provide investors with a more valuable measure of our performance because it better reveals trends in our business.    ﻿   FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS – CAUTIONARY LANGUAGE   ﻿   Certain statements made in this report and in other written or oral statements made by us or on our behalf are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (“PSLRA”). A forward-looking statement is a statement that is not a historical fact and, without limitation, includes any statement that may predict, forecast, indicate or imply future results, performance or achievements, and may contain words like: “believe,” “anticipate,” “expect,” “estimate,” “project,” “will,” “shall” and other words or phrases with similar meaning in connection with a discussion of future operating or financial performance. In particular, these include statements relating to future actions, trends in our businesses, prospective services or products, future performance or financial results and the outcome of contingencies, such as legal proceedings. We claim the protection afforded by the safe harbor for forward-looking statements provided by the PSLRA.    ﻿   Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from the results contained in the forward-looking statements. Risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to vary materially, some of which are described within the forward-looking statements, include, among others:    ﻿     ·    Deterioration in general economic and business conditions that may affect account values, investment results, guaranteed benefit liabilities, premium levels, claims experience and the level of pension benefit costs, funding and investment results;     ·    Adverse global capital and credit market conditions could affect our ability to raise capital, if necessary, and may cause us to realize impairments on investments and certain intangible assets, including goodwill and the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets, which may reduce future earnings and/or affect our financial condition and ability to raise additional capital or refinance existing debt as it matures;     ·    Because of our holding company structure, the inability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends to the holding company in sufficient amounts could harm the holding company’s ability to meet its obligations;    ·    Legislative, regulatory or tax changes, both domestic and foreign, that affect: the cost of, or demand for, our subsidiaries’ products, the required amount of reserves and/or surplus, our ability to conduct business and our captive reinsurance arrangements as well as restrictions on revenue sharing and 12b‑1 payments, the potential for U.S. federal tax reform and the effect of the Department of Labor’s (“DOL”) regulation defining fiduciary;    ·    Actions taken by reinsurers to raise rates on in-force business;     ·    Declines in or sustained low interest rates causing a reduction in investment income, the interest margins of our businesses, estimated gross profits (“EGPs”) and demand for our products;     ·    Rapidly increasing interest rates causing contract holders to surrender life insurance and annuity policies, thereby causing realized investment losses, and reduced hedge performance related to variable annuities;    ·    Uncertainty about the effect of continuing promulgation and implementation of rules and regulations under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act on us and the economy and financial services sector in particular;    ·    The initiation of legal or regulatory proceedings against us, and the outcome of any legal or regulatory proceedings, such as: adverse actions related to present or past business practices common in businesses in which we compete; adverse decisions in significant      43         actions including, but not limited to, actions brought by federal and state authorities and class action cases; new decisions that result in changes in law; and unexpected trial court rulings;    ·    A decline in the equity markets causing a reduction in the sales of our subsidiaries’ products, a reduction of asset-based fees that our subsidiaries charge on various investment and insurance products, an acceleration of the net amortization of deferred acquisition costs (“DAC”), value of business acquired (“VOBA”), deferred sales inducements (“DSI”) and deferred front-end loads (“DFEL”) and an increase in liabilities related to guaranteed benefit features of our subsidiaries’ variable annuity products;    ·    Ineffectiveness of our risk management policies and procedures, including various hedging strategies used to offset the effect of changes in the value of liabilities due to changes in the level and volatility of the equity markets and interest rates;    ·    A deviation in actual experience regarding future persistency, mortality, morbidity, interest rates or equity market returns from the assumptions used in pricing our subsidiaries’ products, in establishing related insurance reserves and in the net amortization of DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL, which may reduce future earnings;     ·    Changes in GAAP that may result in unanticipated changes to our net income;    ·    Lowering of one or more of our debt ratings issued by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations and the adverse effect such action may have on our ability to raise capital and on our liquidity and financial condition;    ·    Lowering of one or more of the insurer financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries and the adverse effect such action may have on the premium writings, policy retention, profitability of our insurance subsidiaries and liquidity;    ·    Significant credit, accounting, fraud, corporate governance or other issues that may adversely affect the value of certain investments in our portfolios, as well as counterparties to which we are exposed to credit risk, requiring that we realize losses on investments;    ·    Inability to protect our intellectual property rights or claims of infringement of the intellectual property rights of others;    ·    Interruption in telecommunication, information technology or other operational systems or failure to safeguard the confidentiality or privacy of sensitive data on such systems from cyberattacks or other breaches of our data security systems;    ·    The effect of acquisitions and divestitures, restructurings, product withdrawals and other unusual items;    ·    The adequacy and collectability of reinsurance that we have purchased;    ·    Acts of terrorism, a pandemic, war or other man-made and natural catastrophes that may adversely affect our businesses and the cost and availability of reinsurance;    ·    Competitive conditions, including pricing pressures, new product offerings and the emergence of new competitors, that may affect the level of premiums and fees that our subsidiaries can charge for their products;    ·    The unknown effect on our subsidiaries’ businesses resulting from changes in the demographics of their client base, as aging baby-boomers move from the asset-accumulation stage to the asset-distribution stage of life; and    ·    The unanticipated loss of key management, financial planners or wholesalers.  ﻿   The risks included here are not exhaustive. Our annual report on Form 10-K, current reports on Form 8-K and other documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) include additional factors that could affect our businesses and financial performance. Moreover, we operate in a rapidly changing and competitive environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors.    ﻿   Further, it is not possible to assess the effect of all risk factors on our businesses or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results. In addition, we disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that occur after the date of this report.    ﻿   INTRODUCTION   ﻿   Executive Summary    ﻿   We are a holding company that operates multiple insurance and retirement businesses through subsidiary companies. Through our business segments, we sell a wide range of wealth protection, accumulation and retirement income products and solutions. These products include fixed and indexed annuities, variable annuities, universal life insurance (“UL”), variable universal life insurance (“VUL”), linked-benefit UL, indexed universal life insurance (“IUL”), term life insurance, employer-sponsored retirement plans and services, and group life, disability and dental.   ﻿   We provide products and services and report results through our Annuities, Retirement Plan Services, Life Insurance and Group Protection segments. We also have Other Operations. These segments and Other Operations are described in “Part I – Item 1. Business” of our 2016 Form 10-K.    ﻿   For information on how we derive our revenues, see the discussion in results of operations by segment below.   ﻿   Our current market conditions, significant operational matters, industry trends, issues and outlook are described in “Part II – Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Introduction – Executive Summary” of our 2016 Form 10-K.    ﻿   For factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in this section, see “Forward-Looking Statements – Cautionary Language” above and “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2016 Form 10-K as updated by “Part II – Item 1A. Risk Factors” below.       44         Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates   ﻿   The MD&A included in our 2016 Form 10-K contains a detailed discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates. The following information updates the “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” provided in our 2016 Form 10-K and, accordingly, should be read in conjunction with the “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” discussed in our 2016 Form 10-K.   ﻿   DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL   ﻿   Reversion to the Mean   ﻿   As variable fund returns do not move in a systematic manner, we reset the baseline of account values from which EGPs are projected, which we refer to as our reversion to the mean (“RTM”) process, as discussed in our 2016 Form 10-K.    ﻿   If we had unlocked our RTM assumption as of March 31, 2017, we would have recorded a favorable unlocking of approximately $160 million, pre-tax, for Annuities, approximately $25 million, pre-tax, for Retirement Plan Services and approximately $20 million, pre-tax, for Life Insurance.   ﻿   Investments   ﻿   Investment Valuation    ﻿   The following summarizes our available-for-sale (“AFS”) and trading securities and derivative investments carried at fair value by pricing source and fair value hierarchy level (in millions) as of March 31, 2017:   ﻿      ﻿                                                                      ﻿                                                                      ﻿        Quoted                                                          ﻿        Prices                                                          ﻿        in Active                                                          ﻿    Markets for    Significant    Significant                      ﻿        Identical        Observable    Unobservable                      ﻿        Assets            Inputs            Inputs            Total          ﻿        (Level 1)            (Level 2)            (Level 3)            Fair Value          Priced by third-party pricing services        $  896 				           $  77,954 				           $     -            $  78,850 				         Priced by independent broker quotations             -                 -              1,193 				             1,193 				         Priced by matrices             -              12,081 				                -              12,081 				         Priced by other methods (1)             -                 -              1,927 				             1,927 				         Total        $  896 				           $  90,035 				           $  3,120 				           $  94,051 				         ﻿                                                                      Percent of total          1% 				             96% 				             3% 				             100% 				        ﻿     (1)    Represents primarily securities for which pricing models were used to compute fair value.   ﻿   ﻿   For more information about the valuation of our financial instruments carried at fair value, see “Part II – Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Introduction – Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Investments – Investment Valuation” in our 2016 Form 10-K and Note 12 herein.   ﻿   As of March 31, 2017, we evaluated the markets that our securities trade in and concluded that none were inactive. We will continue to re-evaluate this conclusion, as needed, based on market conditions. We use unobservable inputs to measure the fair value of securities trading in less liquid or illiquid markets with limited or no pricing information. We obtain broker quotes for securities such as synthetic convertibles, index-linked certificates of deposit and collateralized debt obligations (“CDOs”) when sufficient security structure or other market information is not available to produce an evaluation. For broker-quoted only securities, non-binding quotes from market makers or broker-dealers are obtained from sources recognized as market participants. Broker-quoted securities are based solely on receipt of updated quotes from a single market maker or a broker-dealer recognized as a market participant. Our broker-quoted only securities are generally classified as Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. As of March 31, 2017, we used broker quotes for 25 securities as our final price source, representing less than 1% of total securities owned.    ﻿   Derivatives    ﻿   Our accounting policies for derivatives and the potential effect on interest spreads in a falling rate environment are discussed in Note 5 of this report and “Part II – Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” in our 2016 Form 10-K.   ﻿   Guaranteed Living Benefits   ﻿   Within our individual annuity business, 65% and 67% of our variable annuity account values contained guaranteed living benefits (“GLB”) features as of March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Underperforming equity markets increase our exposure to potential      45         benefits with the GLB features. A contract with a GLB feature is “in the money” if the contract holder’s account balance falls below the present value of guaranteed withdrawal or income benefits, assuming no lapses. As of March 31, 2017 and 2016, 8% and 11%, respectively, of all in-force contracts with a GLB feature were “in the money,” and our exposure, after reinsurance, as of March 31, 2017 and 2016, was $538 million and $679 million, respectively. However, the only way the contract holder can realize the excess of the present value of benefits over the account value of the contract is through a series of withdrawals or income payments that do not exceed a maximum amount. If, after the series of withdrawals or income payments, the account value is exhausted, the contract holder will continue to receive a series of annuity payments. The account value can also fluctuate with equity market returns on a daily basis resulting in increases or decreases in the excess of the present value of benefits over account value.   ﻿   For information on our variable annuity hedge program performance, see our discussion in “Realized Gain (Loss) and Benefit Ratio Unlocking – Variable Annuity Net Derivatives Results” below.    ﻿   For information on our estimates of the potential instantaneous effect to net income that could result from sudden changes that may occur in equity markets, interest rates and implied market volatilities, see our discussion in “Part II – Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Introduction – Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Derivatives – GLB” in our 2016 Form 10-K.   ﻿

       Comparison of the Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 to 2016   ﻿   Net income increased due primarily to the following:    ﻿     ·    Growth in business in force and average account values.    ·    Higher federal income tax benefits in 2017 driven by one-time and run-rate adjustments primarily associated with our separate account dividends-received deduction.     ·    Favorable investment income on alternative investments.    ·    Legal expenses in 2016 related to certain investments.    ·    Gains on variable annuity net derivative results in 2017 as compared to losses in 2016.     ·    Higher realized losses in 2016 driven by an increase in other-than-temporary impairment (“OTTI”) attributable to individual credit risks within our corporate bond holdings.  ﻿   The increase in net income was partially offset by the following:   ﻿     ·    Spread compression due to average new money rates trailing our current portfolio yields, partially offset by actions implemented to  reduce

(3)    Consists primarily of revenues attributable to broker-dealer services that are subject to market volatility.  ﻿   Comparison of the Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 to 2016    ﻿   Income from operations for this segment increased due primarily to the following:   ﻿     ·    Higher federal income tax benefits in 2017 driven by one-time and run-rate adjustments primarily associated with our separate account dividends-received deduction.     ·    Higher fee income driven by higher average daily variable account values as a result of higher average equity markets, partially offset by negative net flows.  ﻿   The increase in income from operations was partially offset by higher commissions and other expenses due to higher average account values, resulting in higher trail commissions.   ﻿       47         We provide information about this segment’s operating revenue and operating expense line items, the period in which amounts are recognized, key drivers of changes and historical details underlying the line items and their associated drivers below.    ﻿   See the Variable Account Value Information table within “Fee Income” below for drivers of changes in our variable account values and the Fixed Account Value Information table within “Net Investment Income and Interest Credited” below for drivers of changes in our fixed account values.   ﻿   Additional Information   ﻿   New deposits are an important component of net flows and key to our efforts to grow our business. Although deposits do not significantly affect current period income from operations, they can significantly impact future income from operations. For the three months ended March 31, 2017, 38% of our variable annuity deposits were on products without GLB riders, compared to 26% for the corresponding period in 2016. As a result of regulatory uncertainty and evolving market trends, our variable annuity deposits were significantly lower than historical periods resulting in negative net flows for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016.   ﻿   The other component of net flows relates to the retention of the business. An important measure of retention is the reduction in account values caused by full surrenders, deaths and other contract benefits. These outflows as a percentage of average account values were 9% for the three months ended March 31, 2017, compared to 8% for the corresponding period in 2016.   ﻿   Our fixed annuity business includes products with discretionary crediting rates that are reset on an annual basis and are not subject to surrender charges. Our ability to retain annual reset annuities will be subject to current competitive conditions at the time interest rates for these products reset. We expect to manage the effects of spreads on near-term income from operations through portfolio management and, to a lesser extent, crediting rate actions, which assumes no significant changes in net flows into or out of our fixed accounts or other changes that may cause interest rate spreads to differ from our expectations.

See Note 7 for additional information.  ﻿   We charge contract holders mortality and expense assessments on variable annuity accounts to cover insurance and administrative expenses. These assessments are a function of the rates priced into the product and the average daily variable account values. Average daily account values are driven by net flows and variable fund returns. Charges on GLB riders are assessed based on a contractual rate that is applied either to the account value or the guaranteed amount. In addition, for our fixed annuity contracts and for some variable contracts, we collect surrender charges when contract holders surrender their contracts during their surrender charge periods to protect us from premature withdrawals.

An important measure of retention is the reduction in account values caused primarily by plan sponsor terminations and participant withdrawals. These outflows as a percentage of average account values were 14% and 13% for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.    ﻿   Our net flows are negatively affected by the continued net outflows from our oldest blocks of annuities business (as presented on our Account Value Roll Forward table below as “Multi-Fund® and Other”), which are among our higher margin product lines in this segment, due to the fact that they are mature blocks with low distribution and servicing costs. The proportion of these products to our total account values was 27% and 30% for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Due to this expected overall shift in business mix toward products with lower returns, an increase in new deposit production continues to be necessary to maintain earnings at current levels.    ﻿   Our fixed annuity business includes products with discretionary and index-based crediting rates that are reset on either a quarterly or semi-annual basis. Our ability to retain quarterly or semi-annual reset annuities will be subject to current competitive conditions at the      53         time interest rates for these products reset. We expect to manage the effects of spreads on near-term income from operations through portfolio management and, to a lesser extent, crediting rate actions, which assumes no significant changes in net flows into or out of our fixed accounts or other changes that may cause interest rate spreads to differ from our expectations.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – Interest Rate Risk – Interest Rate Risk on Fixed Insurance Businesses – Falling Rates” and “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors – Market Conditions – Changes in interest rates and sustained low interest rates may cause interest rate spreads to decrease and changes in interest rates may also result in increased contract withdrawals” in our 2016 Form 10-K.   ﻿   On April 8, 2016, the DOL released the final fiduciary advice regulation that provides for a phased implementation, the first of which was originally planned to be effective April 10, 2017, with full implementation by January 1, 2018. On April 7, 2017, the DOL announced a 60-day delay of the fiduciary advice regulation, moving the phased implementation effective date from April 10, 2017, to June 9, 2017.

Term products and UL products containing secondary guarantees require reserves calculated pursuant to the Valuation of Life Insurance Policies Model Regulation (“XXX”) and Actuarial Guideline 38 (“AG38”). For information on strategies we use to reduce the statutory reserve strain caused by XXX and AG38, see “Review of Consolidated Financial Condition – Liquidity and Capital Resources – Sources of Liquidity and Cash Flow – Insurance Subsidiaries’ Statutory Capital and Surplus” below.       Additional Information   ﻿   During the first quarter of 2017, we experienced favorable mortality relative to our expectations for claims seasonality.   ﻿   For information on interest rate spreads and interest rate risk, see “Item 3.

In addition, benefits include the change in secondary guarantee and linked-benefit life insurance product reserves. These reserves are affected by changes in expected future trends of assessments and benefits causing unlocking adjustments to these liabilities similar to DAC, VOBA and DFEL. Generally, we have higher mortality in the first quarter of the year due to the seasonality of claims.

When comparing DAC and VOBA deferrals as a percentage of sales for the three months ended March 31, 2017, to the corresponding period in 2016, the decrease was primarily a result of changes in sales mix to products with lower commission rates.

Investment income on capital in excess of the calculated amounts is reported in Other Operations. If our business segments require increases in statutory reserves, surplus or investments, the amount of excess capital that is retained by Other Operations would decrease and net investment income would be negatively affected.   ﻿   Write-downs for OTTI decrease the recorded value of our invested assets owned by the business segments. These write-downs are not included in the income from operations of our business segments. When impairment occurs, assets are transferred to the business segments’ portfolios and will reduce the future net investment income for Other Operations. Statutory reserve adjustments for our business segments can also cause allocations of invested assets between the business segments and Other Operations.       The majority of our interest credited relates to our reinsurance operations sold to Swiss Re Life & Health America, Inc. (“Swiss Re”) in 2001. A substantial amount of the business was sold through indemnity reinsurance transactions, which is still recorded in our consolidated financial statements. The interest credited corresponds to investment income earnings on the assets we continue to hold for this business. There is no effect to income or loss in Other Operations or on a consolidated basis for these amounts because interest earned on the blocks that continue to be reinsured is passed through to Swiss Re in the form of interest credited.   ﻿   Benefits   ﻿   Benefits are recognized when incurred for institutional pension products and disability income business.   ﻿       66            Other Expenses   ﻿   ﻿   Details underlying other expenses (in millions) were as follows:   ﻿   ﻿      ﻿                                      ﻿                                      ﻿    For the Three                  ﻿    Months Ended                  ﻿    March 31,                  ﻿    2017        2016        Change          General and administrative expenses:                                      Legal    $     -        $  1 				       -100%          Branding      5 				         7 				       -29%          Other (1)      9 				         (8 				   )  213% 				         Total general and administrative                                       expenses      14 				            -        NM          Taxes, licenses and fees      (1 				   )      (6 				   )  83% 				         Inter-segment reimbursement associated                                      with reserve financing and                                       LOC expenses (2)      (3 				   )      (2 				   )    -50%          Total other expenses    $  10 				       $  (8 				   )  225% 				        ﻿     (1)    Includes expenses that are corporate in nature including charitable contributions, the portion of our deferred compensation plan expense attributable to participants’ selection of LNC stock as the measure for their investment return and other expenses not allocated to our business segments.

We follow a balanced approach to investing for both current income and prudent risk management, with an emphasis on generating sufficient current income, net of income tax, to meet our obligations to customers, as well as other general liabilities. This balanced approach requires the evaluation of expected return and risk of each asset class utilized, while still meeting our income objectives. This approach is important to our asset-liability management because decisions can be made based upon both the economic and current investment income considerations affecting assets and liabilities.  For a discussion of our risk management process, see “Item 7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” in our 2016 Form 10-K.   ﻿   Investment Portfolio Composition and Diversification   ﻿   Fundamental to our investment policy is diversification across asset classes. Our investment portfolio, excluding cash and invested cash, is composed of fixed maturity securities, mortgage loans on real estate, real estate (either wholly-owned or in joint ventures) and other long-term investments. We purchase investments for our segmented portfolios that have yield, duration and other characteristics that take into account the liabilities of the products being supported.    ﻿   We have the ability to maintain our investment holdings throughout credit cycles because of our capital position, the long-term nature of our liabilities and the matching of our portfolios of investment assets with the liabilities of our various products.        70            Fixed Maturity and Equity Securities Portfolios   ﻿   Fixed maturity and equity securities consist of portfolios classified as AFS and trading. Details underlying our fixed maturity and equity securities portfolios by industry classification (in millions) are presented in the tables below. These tables agree in total with the presentation of AFS securities in Note 4; however, the categories below represent a more detailed breakout of the AFS portfolio.

(2)    Includes unrealized gains and (losses) on impaired securities related to changes in the fair value of such securities subsequent to the impairment measurement date.  ﻿       72            AFS Securities   ﻿   In accordance with the AFS accounting guidance, we reflect stockholders’ equity as if unrealized gains and losses were actually recognized, and consider all related accounting adjustments that would occur upon such a hypothetical recognition of unrealized gains and losses. Such related balance sheet effects include adjustments to the balances of DAC, VOBA, DFEL, future contract benefits, other contract holder funds and deferred income taxes. Adjustments to each of these balances are charged or credited to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). For instance, DAC is adjusted upon the recognition of unrealized gains or losses because the amortization of DAC is based upon an assumed emergence of gross profits on certain insurance business. Deferred income tax balances are also adjusted because unrealized gains or losses do not affect actual taxes currently paid.    ﻿   The quality of our AFS fixed maturity securities portfolio, as measured at estimated fair value and by the percentage of fixed maturity AFS securities invested in various ratings categories, relative to the entire fixed maturity AFS security portfolio (in millions) was as follows:   ﻿      ﻿                                                                                  ﻿                                                                                  ﻿        Rating Agency        As of March 31, 2017        As of December 31, 2016          NAIC        Equivalent        Amortized        Fair        % of        Amortized        Fair        % of          Designation (1)        Designation (1)        Cost        Value        Total        Cost        Value        Total          ﻿                                                                                  Investment Grade Securities                                                                          1        Aaa / Aa / A        $  45,971 				       $  49,498 				     54.3% 				       $  45,661 				       $  49,061 				     55.0% 				         2        Baa          35,906 				         37,732 				     41.4% 				         34,643 				         36,134 				     40.5% 				         Total investment grade securities          81,877 				         87,230 				     95.7% 				         80,304 				         85,195 				     95.5% 				         ﻿                                                                                  Below Investment Grade Securities                                                                          3        Ba          2,796 				         2,805 				     3.1% 				         2,881 				         2,849 				     3.2% 				         4        B          917 				         851 				     0.9% 				         940 				         845 				     1.0% 				         5        Caa and lower          224 				         197 				     0.3% 				         257 				         223 				     0.2% 				         6        In or near default          20 				         19 				     0.0% 				         105 				         101 				     0.1% 				         Total below investment grade securities          3,957 				         3,872 				     4.3% 				         4,183 				         4,018 				     4.5% 				         Total fixed maturity AFS securities        $  85,834 				       $  91,102 				     100.0% 				       $  84,487 				       $  89,213 				     100.0% 				         ﻿                                                                                  Total securities below investment                                                                          grade as a percentage of total                                                                          fixed maturity AFS securities          4.6% 				         4.3% 				                 5.0% 				         4.5% 				                ﻿     (1)    Based upon the rating designations determined and provided by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”) or the major credit rating agencies (Fitch Ratings (“Fitch”), Moody’s Investors Service (“Moody’s”) and S&P).  For securities where the ratings assigned by the major credit rating agencies are not equivalent, the second highest rating assigned is used.  For those securities where ratings by the major credit rating agencies are not available, which does not represent a significant amount of our total fixed maturity AFS securities, we base the ratings disclosed upon internal ratings. The average credit quality was A- as of March 31, 2017.   ﻿   Comparisons between the NAIC ratings and rating agency designations are published by the NAIC. The NAIC assigns securities quality ratings and uniform valuations, which are used by insurers when preparing their annual statements. The NAIC ratings are similar to the rating agency designations of the Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations for marketable bonds. NAIC ratings 1 and 2 include bonds generally considered investment grade (rated Baa3 or higher by Moody’s, or rated BBB- or higher by S&P and Fitch) by such ratings organizations. However, securities rated NAIC 1 and 2 could be deemed below investment grade by the rating agencies as a result of the current RBC rules for residential mortgage-backed securities (“RMBS”) and CMBS for statutory reporting. NAIC ratings 3 through 6 include bonds generally considered below investment grade (rated Ba or lower by Moody’s, or rated BB+ or lower by S&P and Fitch).    ﻿   As of March 31, 2017, and December 31, 2016, 91.9% and 90.8%, respectively, of the total publicly traded and private securities in an unrealized loss position were investment grade. Our gross unrealized losses, including the portion of OTTI recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) (“OCI”), on AFS securities as of March 31, 2017, decreased by $0.2 billion since December 31, 2016. As more fully described in Note 1 in our 2016 Form 10-K, we regularly review our investment holdings for OTTI. We believe the unrealized loss position as of March 31, 2017, does not represent OTTI as: (i) we do not intend to sell the debt securities; (ii) it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the debt securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis; (iii) the estimated future cash flows are equal to or greater than the amortized cost basis of the debt securities; and (iv) we have the ability and intent to hold the equity securities for a period of time sufficient for recovery. For further information on our unrealized losses on AFS securities, see “Composition by Industry Categories of our Unrealized Losses on AFS Securities” below.   ﻿   ﻿   ﻿   ﻿   ﻿       73         In our evaluation of OTTI, we concluded: (i) that it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the fixed maturity AFS securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis; (ii) that the estimated future cash flows are equal to or greater than the amortized cost basis of the debt securities; and (iii) that we have the ability to hold the equity AFS securities for a period of time sufficient for recovery. This conclusion is consistent with our asset-liability management process. Management considers the following as part of the evaluation:   ﻿     ·    The current economic environment and market conditions;    ·    Our business strategy and current business plans;    ·    The nature and type of security, including expected maturities and exposure to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risk;    ·    Our analysis of data from financial models and other internal and industry sources to evaluate the current effectiveness of our hedging and overall risk management strategies;    ·    The current and expected timing of contractual maturities of our assets and liabilities, expectations of prepayments on investments and expectations for surrenders and withdrawals of life insurance policies and annuity contracts;    ·    The capital risk limits approved by management; and    ·    Our current financial condition and liquidity demands.  ﻿   To determine the recoverability of a debt security, we consider the facts and circumstances surrounding the underlying issuer including, but not limited to, the following:   ﻿     ·    Historical and implied volatility of the security;    ·    Length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than amortized cost;     ·    Adverse conditions specifically related to the security or to specific conditions in an industry or geographic area;     ·    Failure, if any, of the issuer of the security to make scheduled payments; and    ·    Recoveries or additional declines in fair value subsequent to the balance sheet date.   ﻿   As reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, we had $110.6 billion of investments and cash, which exceeded the liabilities for our future obligations under insurance policies and contracts, net of amounts recoverable from reinsurers, which totaled $95.9 billion as of March 31, 2017. If it were necessary to liquidate securities prior to maturity or call to meet cash flow needs, we would first look to those securities that are in an unrealized gain position, which had a fair value of $71.6 billion as of March 31, 2017, rather than selling securities in an unrealized loss position. The amount of cash that we have on hand at any point in time takes into account our liquidity needs in the future, other sources of cash, such as the maturities of investments, interest and dividends we earn on our investments and the ongoing cash flows from new and existing business.    ﻿   See “AFS Securities – Evaluation for Recovery of Amortized Cost” in Note 1 in our 2016 Form 10-K and Note 4 herein for additional discussion.   ﻿   As of March 31, 2017, and December 31, 2016, the estimated fair value for all private placement securities was $14.1 billion, representing 13% of total invested assets.   ﻿   For information regarding our VIEs’ fixed maturity securities, see Note 4 in our 2016 Form 10-K and Note 3 herein.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Consolidated Investments – Mortgage-Backed Securities” in our 2016 Form 10-K for a discussion of our mortgage-backed securities (“MBS”).    ﻿   Our ABS home equity and RMBS had a market value of $4.4 billion and an unrealized gain of $114 million as of March 31, 2017.    ﻿   ﻿   ﻿   ﻿   ﻿   ﻿   ﻿   ﻿   ﻿   ﻿   ﻿   ﻿   ﻿   ﻿   ﻿   ﻿   ﻿       74         The market value of AFS securities and trading securities backed by subprime loans was $586 million and represented approximately 1% of our total investment portfolio as of March 31, 2017. AFS securities represented $579 million, or 99%, and trading securities represented $7 million, or 1%, of the subprime exposure as of March 31, 2017.

The profitability of our fixed annuity and life insurance products is affected by our ability to achieve target spreads, or margins, between the interest income earned on the general account assets and the interest credited to the contract holder on our average fixed account values, including the fixed portion of variable. Net investment income and the interest rate yield table each include commercial mortgage loan prepayments and bond make-whole premiums, alternative investments and contingent interest and standby real estate equity commitments. These items can vary significantly from period to period due to a number of factors and, therefore, can provide results that are not indicative of the underlying trends.   ﻿   Commercial Mortgage Loan Prepayment and Bond Make-Whole Premiums   ﻿   Prepayment and make-whole premiums are collected when borrowers elect to call or prepay their debt prior to the stated maturity. A prepayment or make-whole premium allows investors to attain the same yield as if the borrower made all scheduled interest payments until maturity. These premiums are designed to make investors indifferent to prepayment.   ﻿   Realized Gain (Loss) Related to Certain Investments   ﻿   Details of the realized gain (loss) related to certain investments (in millions) were as follows:   ﻿      ﻿                                  ﻿                                  ﻿    For the Three              ﻿    Months Ended              ﻿    March 31,              ﻿    2017        2016              Fixed maturity AFS securities: (1)                                  Gross gains    $  8 				       $  54 				             Gross losses      (12 				   )      (98 				   )          Equity AFS securities:                                  Gross gains      1 				            -              Gross losses         -             -              Gain (loss) on other investments      (3 				   )      (60 				   )          Associated amortization of DAC, VOBA,                                  DSI and DFEL and changes in                                   other contract holder funds      (7 				   )      (3 				   )          Total realized gain (loss) related to                                   certain investments, pre-tax    $  (13 				   )    $  (107 				   )         ﻿     (1)    These amounts are represented net of related fair value hedging activity. See Note 5 for more information.  ﻿   Amortization of DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL and changes in other contract holder funds reflect an assumption for an expected level of credit-related investment losses.  When actual credit-related investment losses are realized, we recognize a true-up to our DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL amortization and changes in other contract holder funds within realized losses reflecting the incremental effect of actual versus expected credit-related investment losses. These actual to expected amortization adjustments could create volatility in net realized gains and losses.       80         Realized gains and losses generally originate from asset sales to reposition the portfolio or to respond to product experience. During the first three months of 2017 and 2016, we sold securities for gains and losses.  In the process of evaluating whether a security with an unrealized loss reflects declines that are other-than-temporary, we consider our ability and intent to sell the security prior to a recovery of value.  However, subsequent decisions on securities sales are made within the context of overall risk monitoring, assessing value relative to other comparable securities and overall portfolio maintenance. Although our portfolio managers may, at a given point in time, believe that the preferred course of action is to hold securities with unrealized losses that are considered temporary until such losses are recovered, the dynamic nature of portfolio management may result in a subsequent decision to sell. These subsequent decisions are consistent with the classification of our investment portfolio as AFS. We expect to continue to manage all non-trading invested assets within our portfolios in a manner that is consistent with the AFS classification.    ﻿   We consider economic factors and circumstances within countries and industries where recent write-downs have occurred in our assessment of the position of securities we own of similarly situated issuers. While it is possible for realized or unrealized losses on a particular investment to affect other investments, our risk management strategy has been designed to identify correlation risks and other risks inherent in managing an investment portfolio. Once identified, strategies and procedures are developed to effectively monitor and manage these risks. The areas of risk correlation that we pay particular attention to are risks that may be correlated within specific financial and business markets, risks within specific industries and risks associated with related parties.   ﻿   When the detailed analysis by our external asset managers and investment portfolio managers leads us to the conclusion that a security’s decline in fair value is other-than-temporary, the security is written down to estimated recovery value. In instances where declines are considered temporary, the security will continue to be carefully monitored. See “Part II – Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Introduction – Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Investments – Write-downs for OTTI and Allowance for Losses” in our 2016 Form 10-K for additional information on our portfolio management strategy.   ﻿   Details underlying write-downs taken as a result of OTTI (in millions) were as follows:   ﻿      ﻿                                      ﻿                                      ﻿    For the Three                  ﻿    Months Ended                  ﻿    March 31,                  ﻿    2017        2016        Change          OTTI Recognized in Net Income (Loss)                                      Fixed maturity securities:                                      Corporate bonds    $  (2 				   )    $  (36 				   )  94% 				         ABS      (1 				   )      (2 				   )  50% 				         RMBS      (1 				   )      (2 				   )  50% 				         Gross OTTI recognized in net income (loss)      (4 				   )      (40 				   )  90% 				         Associated amortization of DAC,                                      VOBA, DSI and DFEL         -          4 				       -100%          Net OTTI recognized in net income                                      (loss), pre-tax    $  (4 				   )    $  (36 				   )  89% 				         ﻿                                      Portion of OTTI Recognized in OCI                                       Gross OTTI recognized in OCI    $     -        $  26 				       -100%          Change in DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL         -          (6 				   )  100% 				         Net portion of OTTI recognized in OCI,                                       pre-tax    $     -        $  20 				       -100%         ﻿   The $4 million of impairments taken during the first three months of 2017 were all credit-related impairments. The decrease in write-downs for OTTI when comparing the first three months of 2017 to the corresponding period in 2016 was primarily attributable to the stabilization of certain corporate bond holdings within the energy and other commodity sectors that experienced deteriorating fundamentals in prior quarters.   ﻿   ﻿       81            REVIEW OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION   ﻿   Liquidity and Capital Resources   ﻿   Sources of Liquidity and Cash Flow   ﻿   ﻿   Liquidity refers to the ability of an enterprise to generate adequate amounts of cash from its normal operations to meet cash requirements with a prudent margin of safety. Our principal sources of cash flow from operating activities are insurance premiums and fees and investment income, while sources of cash flows from investing activities result from maturities and sales of invested assets. Our operating activities provided cash of $109 million and $298 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. When considering our liquidity and cash flow, it is important to distinguish between the needs of our insurance subsidiaries and the needs of the holding company, LNC. As a holding company with no operations of its own, LNC derives its cash primarily from its operating subsidiaries.    ﻿   The sources of liquidity of the holding company are principally comprised of dividends and interest payments from subsidiaries, augmented by holding company short-term investments, bank lines of credit and the ongoing availability of long-term public financing under an SEC-filed shelf registration statement. These sources of liquidity and cash flow support the general corporate needs of the holding company, including its common stock dividends, interest and debt service, funding of callable securities, securities repurchases, acquisitions and investment in core businesses.    ﻿   Details underlying the primary sources of our holding company cash flows (in millions) were as follows:   ﻿      ﻿                                      ﻿                                      ﻿    For the Three                  ﻿    Months Ended                  ﻿    March 31,                  ﻿    2017        2016        Change          Dividends from Subsidiaries                                      The Lincoln National Life Insurance Company    $  210 				       $  200 				     5% 				         Lincoln National Management Corporation      65 				            -        NM          Total dividends from subsidiaries    $  275 				       $  200 				     38% 				         ﻿                                      Loan Repayments and Interest from Subsidiaries                                      Interest on inter-company notes    $  51 				       $  30 				     70% 				         ﻿                                      Other Cash Flow Items                                      Amounts received from (paid for taxes on)                                       stock option exercises and restricted stock, net    $  38 				       $  11 				     245% 				        ﻿   The table above focuses on significant and recurring cash flow items and excludes the effects of certain financing activities, namely the periodic issuance and retirement of debt and cash flows related to our inter-company cash management program (discussed below). Taxes have been eliminated from the analysis due to a tax sharing agreement among our primary subsidiaries resulting in a modest effect on net cash flows at the holding company. Also excluded from this analysis is the modest amount of investment income on short-term investments of the holding company.    ﻿   Restrictions on Dividends from Subsidiaries   ﻿   For information regarding limits on the dividends that our insurance subsidiaries may pay without prior approval from the Indiana Insurance Commission (the “Commissioner”), see “Part II – Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Review of Consolidated Financial Condition – Liquidity and Capital Resources – Restrictions on Dividends from Subsidiaries” in our 2016 Form 10-K as updated by “Because we are a holding company with no direct operations, the inability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends to us in sufficient amounts would harm our ability to meet our obligations” in “Part II – Item 1A. Risk Factors” below. This Risk Factor was updated to reflect a recent change to the Indiana Code which revised the statutory limitation on dividends that can be paid without prior approval of the Commissioner back to the greater of 10% of the insurer’s contract holders’ surplus, as shown on its last annual statement on file with the Commissioner, or the insurer’s statutory net gain from operations for the previous 12 months, but in no event to exceed statutory unassigned surplus.   ﻿   As a result of this change, we expect our domestic insurance subsidiaries could pay dividends of approximately $900 million in 2017 without prior approval from the respective state commissioners. The amount of surplus that our insurance subsidiaries could pay as dividends is constrained by the amount of surplus we hold to maintain our ratings, to provide an additional layer of margin for risk protection and for future investment in our businesses.    ﻿       82            Insurance Subsidiaries’ Statutory Capital and Surplus   ﻿   Our regulatory capital levels are also affected by statutory accounting rules, which are subject to change by each applicable insurance regulator. Our term products and UL products containing secondary guarantees require reserves calculated pursuant to XXX and AG38, respectively. During the third quarter of 2013, the New York State Department of Financial Services announced that it would not recognize the NAIC revisions to AG38 in applying the New York law governing the reserves to be held for UL and VUL products containing secondary guarantees. The change, which was effective as of December 31, 2013, impacted the Lincoln Life & Annuity Company of New York (“LLANY”). Although LLANY discontinued the sale of these products in early 2013, the change affected those policies previously sold. We began phasing in the increase in reserves in 2013 at $90 million per year over five years, with the final increase in reserves occurring during the fourth quarter of 2017. As of March 31, 2017, we had increased reserves by $360 million. In April 2016, LLANY entered into a third-party reinsurance arrangement primarily covering UL policies containing secondary guarantees issued between 2002 through 2014 that mitigates the financial impact of the increase of these reserves.   ﻿   As discussed in “Part I – Item 1. Risk Factors – Legislative, Regulatory, and Tax – Attempts to mitigate the impact of Regulation XXX and Actuarial Guideline 38 may fail in whole or in part resulting in an adverse effect on our financial condition and result of operations,” our insurance subsidiaries employ strategies to reduce the strain caused by XXX and AG38 by reinsuring the business to insurance captives. Our captive reinsurance and reinsurance subsidiaries provide a mechanism for financing a portion of the excess reserve amounts in a more efficient manner. We use long-dated LOCs and debt financing as well as other financing strategies to finance those reserves. Included in the LOCs issued as of March 31, 2017, was approximately $3.3 billion of long-dated LOCs issued to support inter-company reinsurance arrangements. Approximately $2.3 billion of such LOCs were issued to support reinsurance for UL products containing secondary guarantees ($350 million will expire in 2019, $1 million will expire in 2021 and $1.9 billion will expire in 2031), and $1.0 billion of such LOCs that will expire in 2023 were issued to support reinsurance for term business. We have also used the proceeds from senior note issuances of $875 million to execute long-term structured solutions supporting reinsurance of UL products containing secondary guarantees. Additionally, our captive reinsurance and reinsurance subsidiaries have issued long-term notes of $1.9 billion as of March 31, 2017, to finance a portion of the excess reserves. For information on these long-term notes issued by our captive reinsurance and reinsurance subsidiaries, see Note 4 in our 2016 Form 10-K. LOCs and related capital market solutions lower the capital effect of term products and UL products containing secondary guarantees.  An inability to obtain appropriate capital market solutions could affect our returns on our in-force term products and UL products containing secondary guarantees. However, we believe that we have sufficient capital to support the increase in statutory reserves, based on our current reserve projections, if such structures were no longer available.   ﻿   Our captive reinsurance and reinsurance subsidiaries free up capital the insurance subsidiaries can use for any number of purposes, including paying dividends to the holding company. Actuarial Guideline 48 (“AG48”) regulates the terms of captive reinsurance arrangements that are entered into or amended in certain ways after December 31, 2014. AG48 imposes restrictions on the types of assets that can be used to support these arrangements. We have implemented and plan to continue to implement these arrangements in compliance with AG48. The NAIC’s adoption of the new Valuation Manual that defines a principles-based reserving framework for newly issued life insurance policies was effective January 1, 2017. Principles-based reserving places a greater weight on our past experience and anticipated future experience as well as considers current economic conditions in calculating life insurance product reserves in accordance with statutory accounting principles. We adopted the new framework for primarily our newly issued term business in 2017 and will phase in the framework prior to January 1, 2020, for all other newly issued life insurance products. We believe that these changes may reduce our future use of captive reinsurance and reinsurance subsidiaries for reserve financing transactions for our life insurance business. For more information on principles-based reserving, see “Part I – Item 1. Business – Regulatory – Insurance Regulation in our 2016 Form 10-K.”   ﻿   Statutory reserves established for variable annuity contracts and riders are sensitive to changes in the equity markets and are affected by the level of account values relative to the level of any guarantees, product design and reinsurance arrangements. As a result, the relationship between reserve changes and equity market performance is non-linear during any given reporting period. Market conditions greatly influence the ultimate capital required due to its effect on the valuation of reserves and derivative assets hedging these reserves. We also utilize inter-company reinsurance arrangements to manage our hedge program for variable annuity guarantees. The NAIC through its various committees, task forces and working groups has been evaluating the adequacy of existing NAIC model regulations with a focus on targeted improvements to the statutory reserving and accounting framework for variable annuities.   ﻿   We continue to analyze the use of our existing captive reinsurance structures, as well as additional third-party reinsurance arrangements, and our current hedging strategies relative to managing the effects of equity markets and interest rates on the statutory reserves, statutory capital and the dividend capacity of our life insurance subsidiaries.   ﻿   Financing Activities   ﻿   Although our subsidiaries currently generate adequate cash flow to meet the needs of our normal operations, periodically we may issue debt or equity securities to maintain ratings and increase liquidity, as well as to fund internal growth, acquisitions and the retirement of our debt and equity securities.    ﻿   We currently have an effective shelf registration statement, which allows us to issue, in unlimited amounts, securities, including debt securities, preferred stock, common stock, warrants, stock purchase contracts, stock purchase units and depository shares.    ﻿       83            Details underlying debt and financing activities (in millions) for the three months ended March 31, 2017, were as follows:   ﻿      ﻿                                                                                          ﻿          ﻿                            Maturities,        Change                                      ﻿                            Repayments        in Fair                                      ﻿    Beginning                     and         Value            Other            Ending      ﻿    Balance        Issuance        Refinancing        Hedges        Changes (1)        Balance      Short-Term Debt                                                                                          Current maturities of long-term debt (2)    $     -        $     -            $     -            $     -            $  200 				           $  200 				     ﻿                                                                                          Long-Term Debt                                                                                          Senior notes    $  3,888 				       $     -            $     -            $  (12 				   )        $  (200 				   )        $  3,676 				     Bank borrowing       250 				            -                 -                 -                 -              250 				     Capital securities (3)      1,207 				            -                 -                 -                 -              1,207 				     Total long-term debt    $  5,345 				       $     -            $     -            $  (12 				   )        $  (200 				   )        $  5,133 				    ﻿     (1)    Includes the net increase (decrease) in commercial paper, non-cash reclassification of long-term debt to current maturities of long-term debt, accretion (amortization) of discounts and premiums and amortization of debt issuance costs, as applicable.    (2)    As of March 31, 2017, consisted of a $200 million 7% fixed-rate senior note maturing on March 15, 2018.    (3)    To hedge the variability in rates, we have purchased forward starting swaps to lock in a fixed rate of approximately 5% over the remaining terms of the capital securities.  ﻿   As of March 31, 2017, the holding company had available liquidity of $551 million. Available liquidity consists of cash and invested cash, excluding cash held as collateral, and certain short-term investments that can be readily converted into cash, net of commercial paper outstanding.    ﻿   For more information about our short-term and long-term debt and our credit facilities and LOCs, see Note 12 in our 2016 Form 10-K.   ﻿   We have not accounted for repurchase agreements, securities lending transactions, or other transactions involving the transfer of financial assets with an obligation to repurchase the transferred assets as sales. For information about our collateralized financing transactions on our investments, see “Payables for Collateral on Investments” in Note 4.   ﻿   If current credit ratings and claims-paying ratings were downgraded in the future, terms in our derivative agreements may be triggered, which could negatively affect overall liquidity. For the majority of our counterparties, there is a termination event with respect to LNC if its long-term senior debt ratings drop below BBB-/Baa3 (S&P/Moody’s); or with respect to Lincoln National Life Insurance Company (“LNL”) if its financial strength ratings drop below BBB-/Baa3 (S&P/Moody’s). Our long-term senior debt held a rating of A-/Baa1 (S&P/Moody’s) as of March 31, 2017. In addition, contractual selling agreements with intermediaries could be negatively affected, which could have an adverse effect on overall sales of annuities, life insurance and investment products. See “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors – Liquidity and Capital Position – A decrease in the capital and surplus of our insurance subsidiaries may result in a downgrade to our credit and insurer financial strength ratings” and “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors – Covenants and Ratings – A downgrade in our financial strength or credit ratings could limit our ability to market products, increase the number or value of policies being surrendered and/or hurt our relationships with creditors” in our 2016 Form 10-K for more information. See “Part I – Item 1. Business – Financial Strength Ratings” in our 2016 Form 10-K for additional information on our current financial strength ratings.   ﻿   See “Part II – Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Review of Consolidated Financial Condition – Liquidity and Capital Resources – Financing Activities” in our 2016 Form 10-K for information on our credit ratings.   ﻿   Alternative Sources of Liquidity   ﻿   In order to manage our capital more efficiently, we have an inter-company cash management program where certain subsidiaries can lend to or borrow from the holding company to meet short-term borrowing needs. The cash management program is essentially a series of demand loans between LNC and participating subsidiaries that reduces overall borrowing costs by allowing LNC and its subsidiaries to access internal resources instead of incurring third-party transaction costs. As of March 31, 2017, the holding company had a net outstanding receivable (payable) of $185 million from (to) certain subsidiaries resulting from loans made by subsidiaries in excess of amounts placed (borrowed) by the holding company and subsidiaries in the inter-company cash management account. Any change in holding company cash management program balances is offset by the immediate and equal change in holding company cash and invested cash. Loans under the cash management program are permitted under applicable insurance laws subject to certain restrictions. For our Indiana-domiciled insurance subsidiaries, the borrowing and lending limit is currently 3% of the insurance company’s admitted assets as of its most recent year end. For our New York-domiciled insurance subsidiary, it may borrow from LNC less than 2% of its admitted assets as of the last year end but may not lend any amounts to LNC.   ﻿   Our insurance subsidiaries, by virtue of their general account fixed-income investment holdings, can access liquidity through securities lending programs and repurchase agreements. Our primary insurance subsidiary, LNL, is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis (“FHLBI”). Membership allows LNL access to the FHLBI’s financial services, including the ability to obtain loans and to issue funding agreements as an alternative source of liquidity that are collateralized by qualifying mortgage-related assets, agency securities      84         or U.S. Treasury securities. Based on regulatory limitations, LNL had an estimated maximum borrowing capacity of $5.0 billion under the FHLBI facility as of March 31, 2017. Borrowings under this facility are subject to the FHLBI’s discretion and require the availability of qualifying assets at LNL As of March 31, 2017, our insurance subsidiaries had investments with a carrying value of $4.2 billion out on loan or subject to repurchase agreements. The cash received in our securities lending programs and repurchase agreements is typically invested in cash equivalents, short-term investments or fixed maturity securities. For additional details, see “Payables for Collateral on Investments” in Note 4.   ﻿   Cash Flows from Collateral on Derivatives   ﻿   Our cash flows associated with collateral received from and posted with counterparties change as the market value of the underlying derivative contract changes. As the value of a derivative asset decreases (or increases), the collateral required to be posted by our counterparties would also decrease (or increase). Likewise, when the value of a derivative liability decreases (or increases), the collateral we are required to post to our counterparties would also decrease (or increase). In the event of adverse changes in fair value of our derivative instruments, we may need to post collateral with a counterparty if our net derivative liability position reaches certain contractual levels. If we do not have sufficient high quality securities or cash and invested cash to provide as collateral, we have liquidity sources, as discussed above, to leverage that would be eligible for collateral posting. For additional information, see “Credit Risk” in Note 5.   ﻿   Divestitures   ﻿   For a discussion of our divestitures, see Note 3 in our 2016 Form 10-K.   ﻿   Uses of Capital   ﻿   Our principal uses of cash are to pay policy claims and benefits, operating expenses, commissions and taxes, to purchase new investments, to purchase reinsurance, to fund policy surrenders and withdrawals, to pay dividends to our stockholders, to repurchase our stock and to repay debt.    ﻿   Return of Capital to Common Stockholders    ﻿   One of the Company’s primary goals is to provide a return to our common stockholders through share price accretion, dividends and stock repurchases. In determining dividends, the Board of Directors takes into consideration items such as current and expected earnings, capital needs, rating agency considerations and requirements for financial flexibility. The amount and timing of share repurchase depends on key capital ratios, rating agency expectations, the generation of free cash flow and an evaluation of the costs and benefits associated with alternative uses of capital. Free cash flow for the holding company generally represents the amount of dividends and interest received from subsidiaries less interest paid on debt.   ﻿   Details underlying this activity (in millions, except per share data), were as follows:   ﻿      ﻿                                      ﻿                                      ﻿    For the Three                  ﻿    Months Ended                  ﻿    March 31,                  ﻿    2017        2016        Change          Common dividends to stockholders    $  66 				       $  61 				     8% 				         Repurchase of common stock      200 				         200 				     0% 				         Total cash returned to stockholders    $  266 				       $  261 				     2% 				         ﻿                                      Number of shares repurchased      2.864 				         5.516 				       -48%          Average price per share    $  69.85 				       $  36.26 				     93% 				        ﻿   On November 1, 2016, our Board of Directors approved an increase of the quarterly dividend on our common stock from $0.25 to $0.29 per share. Additionally, we expect to repurchase additional shares of common stock during 2017 depending on market conditions and alternative uses of capital. For more information regarding share repurchases, see “Part II – Item 2(c)” below.   ﻿       85            Other Uses of Capital   ﻿   In addition to the amounts in the table above in “Return of Capital to Common Stockholders,” other uses of holding company cash flow (in millions) were as follows:   ﻿      ﻿                                      ﻿                                      ﻿    For the Three                  ﻿    Months Ended                  ﻿    March 31,                  ﻿    2017        2016        Change          Debt service (interest paid)    $  62 				       $  65 				       -5%          Capital contribution to subsidiaries      60 				            -        NM          Total    $  122 				       $  65 				     88% 				        ﻿   The above table focuses on significant and recurring cash flow items and excludes the effects of certain financing activities, namely the periodic retirement of debt and cash flows related to our inter-company cash management account. Taxes have been eliminated from the analysis due to a tax sharing agreement among our primary subsidiaries resulting in a modest effect on net cash flows at the holding company.   ﻿   Significant Trends in Sources and Uses of Cash Flow   ﻿   As stated above, LNC’s cash flow, as a holding company, is largely dependent upon the dividend capacity of its insurance company subsidiaries as well as their ability to advance funds to it through inter-company borrowing arrangements, which may be affected by factors influencing the insurance subsidiaries’ RBC and statutory earnings performance. We currently expect to be able to meet the holding company’s ongoing cash needs and to have sufficient capital to offer downside protection in the event that the capital and credit markets experience another period of extreme volatility and disruption. A decline in capital market conditions, which reduces our insurance subsidiaries’ statutory surplus and RBC, may require them to retain more capital and may pressure our subsidiaries’ dividends to the holding company, which may lead us to take steps to preserve or raise additional capital. For factors that could affect our expectations for liquidity and capital, see “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2016 Form 10-K as updated by “Part II – Item 1A. Risk Factors” below.   ﻿   For factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in this section, see “Forward-Looking Statements – Cautionary Language” above and “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2016 Form 10-K as updated by “Part II – Item 1A. Risk Factors” below.   ﻿   Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk    ﻿   We analyze and manage the risks arising from market exposures of financial instruments, as well as other risks, in an integrated asset-liability management process that considers diversification. By aggregating the potential effect of market and other risks on the entire enterprise, we estimate, review and in some cases manage the risk to our earnings and shareholder value. We have exposures to several market risks including interest rate risk, equity market risk, default risk, credit risk and, to a lesser extent, foreign currency exchange risk. The exposures of financial instruments to market risks, and the related risk management processes, are most important to our business where most of the invested assets support accumulation and investment-oriented insurance products. As an important element of our integrated asset-liability management processes, we use derivatives to minimize the effects of changes in interest levels, the shape of the yield curve, currency movements and volatility. In this context, derivatives serve to minimize interest rate risk by mitigating the effect of significant increases in interest rates on our earnings. Additional market exposures exist in our other general account insurance products and in our debt structure and derivatives positions. Our primary sources of market risk are substantial, relatively rapid and sustained increases or decreases in interest rates or a sharp drop in equity market values. These market risks are discussed in detail in the following pages and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements presented in “Item 1. Financial Statements,” as well as “Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”   ﻿   Interest Rate Risk     ﻿   Effect of Interest Rate Sensitivity   ﻿   For information about the effect of interest rate sensitivity on our income (loss) from operations, see “Part II – Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – Interest Rate Risk – Effect of Interest Rate Sensitivity” in our 2016 Form 10-K.   ﻿   Interest Rate Risk on Fixed Insurance Businesses    ﻿   In periods of low interest rates, we have to reinvest the cash we receive as interest or return of principal on our investments in lower yielding instruments. Moreover, borrowers may prepay fixed-income securities, commercial mortgages and mortgage-backed securities in our general accounts in order to borrow at lower market rates, which exacerbates this risk. Because we are entitled to reset the interest rates on our fixed-rate annuities only at limited, pre-established intervals, and because many of our contracts have guaranteed minimum interest or crediting rates, our spreads could decrease and potentially become negative.        86         Prolonged historically low rates are not healthy for our business fundamentals. However, we have recognized this risk and have been proactive in our investment strategies, product designs, crediting rate strategies and overall asset-liability practices to mitigate the risk of unfavorable consequences in this type of environment. For some time now, new products have been sold with low minimum crediting floors, and we apply disciplined asset-liability management standards, such as locking in spreads on these products at the time of issue. See “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors – Market Conditions – Changes in interest rates and sustained low interest rates may cause interest rate spreads to decrease and changes in interest rates may also result in increased contract withdrawals” in our 2016 Form 10-K for additional information on interest rate risks.   ﻿   The following provides detail on the percentage differences between the March 31, 2017, interest rates being credited to contract holders based on the first quarter of 2017 declared rates and the respective minimum guaranteed policy rate (in millions), broken out by contract holder account values reported within our segments:   ﻿   ﻿      ﻿                                                                          ﻿                                                                          ﻿    Account Values          ﻿                Retirement                                %           ﻿                    Plan            Life                         Account          ﻿    Annuities            Services        Insurance (1)        Total        Values          Excess of Crediting Rates over Contract Minimums                                                                          Discretionary rate setting products: (2)                                                                          Occurring within the next twelve months: (3)                                                                          No difference    $  8,419 				           $  12,377 				           $  32,857 				           $  53,653 				     72.0% 				         Up to 0.50%      1,879 				             905 				             439 				             3,223 				     4.3% 				         0.51% to 1.00%      3,555 				             823 				                -              4,378 				     5.9% 				         1.01% to 1.50%      1,502 				             162 				             125 				             1,789 				     2.4% 				         1.51% to 2.00%      232 				                -              94 				             326 				     0.4% 				         2.01% to 2.50%      198 				                -                 -              198 				     0.3% 				         2.51% to 3.00%      23 				                -                 -              23 				     0.0% 				         3.01% or greater         -                 -                 -                 -      0.0% 				         Occurring after the next twelve months (4)      4,691 				                -                 -              4,691 				     6.3% 				         Total discretionary rate setting products       20,499 				             14,267 				             33,515 				             68,281 				     91.6% 				         Other contracts (5)      2,357 				             3,925 				                -              6,282 				     8.4% 				         Total account values    $  22,856 				           $  18,192 				           $  33,515 				           $  74,563 				     100.0% 				         ﻿                                                                          Percentage of discretionary rate setting product account                                                                          values at minimum guaranteed rates      41.1% 				             86.8% 				             98.0% 				             78.6% 				                ﻿     (1)    Excludes policy loans.

For Retirement Plan Services, this amount relates primarily to indexed-based rate setting products in which the average crediting rates were 22 basis points in excess of average minimum guaranteed rates, and 71% of account values were already at their minimum guaranteed rates.  ﻿   The maturity structure and call provisions of the related portfolios are structured to afford protection against erosion of investment portfolio yields during periods of declining interest rates. We devote extensive effort to evaluating the risks associated with falling interest rates by simulating asset and liability cash flows for a wide range of interest rate scenarios. We seek to manage these exposures by maintaining a suitable maturity structure and by limiting our exposure to call risk in each respective investment portfolio.   ﻿   Long-Term New Money Investment Yield Sensitivity   ﻿   For information about the effect of long-term new money investment yield sensitivity on our income (loss) from operations, see “Part II – Item 7A.

Due to the use of our RTM process and our hedging strategies, we expect that, in general, short-term fluctuations in the equity markets should not have a significant effect on our quarterly earnings from unlocking of assumptions for DAC, VOBA, DSI, and DFEL. However, earnings are affected by equity market movements on account values and assets under management and the related fees we earn on those assets. Refer to “Part II – Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Introduction – Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL” in our 2016 Form 10-K for further discussion of the effects of equity markets on our RTM.    ﻿   Effect of Equity Market Sensitivity   ﻿   For information about the effect of equity market sensitivity on our income (loss) from operations, see “Part II – Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – Equity Market Risk – Effect of Equity Market Sensitivity” in our 2016 Form 10-K.   ﻿   Credit Risk   ﻿   We may use credit-related derivatives to minimize our exposure to credit-related events, and we also sell credit default swaps to offer credit protection to our contract holders and investors. Additionally, we are exposed to credit loss in the event of non-performance by our counterparties on various derivative contracts. See Note 5 for additional information on our credit risk.   ﻿   ﻿      ﻿                                         ﻿   Item 4. Controls and Procedures   ﻿   Conclusions Regarding Disclosure Controls and Procedures    ﻿   We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, which are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  As of the end of the period required by this report, we, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting them to material information relating to us and our consolidated subsidiaries required to be disclosed in our periodic reports under the Exchange Act.   ﻿   Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting    ﻿   There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended March 31, 2017, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.    ﻿   A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the company have been detected. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.    ﻿       88            PART II – OTHER INFORMATION   ﻿   Item 1. Legal Proceedings   ﻿   Information regarding reportable legal proceedings is contained in Note 8 in “Part I – Item 1.”   ﻿   Item 1A. Risk Factors   ﻿   Legislative, Regulatory and Tax   ﻿   Federal Regulation   ﻿   Department of Labor regulation defining fiduciary could cause changes to the manner in which we deliver products and services as well as changes in nature and amount of compensation and fees.   ﻿   On April 8, 2016, the Department of Labor (“DOL”) released the DOL Fiduciary Rule, which, when effective, will substantially expand the range of activities that would be considered to be fiduciary investment advice under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and the Internal Revenue Code. As released, the DOL Fiduciary Rule provided for a phased implementation of the provisions of this new regulation, the first of which was to be effective on April 10, 2017, with full implementation by January 1, 2018. Under the DOL Fiduciary Rule, the investment-related information and support that our advisors and employees may provide to plan sponsors, participants and IRA holders on a non-fiduciary basis will be limited more than what is allowed under the current law. As a result, changes to the methods that we use to (i) deliver products and services, and (ii) pay and receive compensation for our investment-related products and services may be required, which may impact sales or margins. In addition, to the extent that advisors with our affiliated retail broker-dealers (Lincoln Financial Network) provide fiduciary investment advice as defined in the DOL Fiduciary Rule, it could expose those broker-dealers and their advisors to additional risk of legal liability in connection with that advice, which ultimately impacts us.   ﻿   On February 3, 2017, President Trump directed the DOL to prepare an updated economic and legal analysis on whether the DOL Fiduciary Rule (i) has harmed or is likely to harm investors due to a reduction of Americans’ access to certain retirement savings offerings, retirement product structures, retirement savings information or related advice, (ii) has resulted in dislocations or disruptions within the retirement services industry that may adversely affect investors or retirees and (iii) is likely to cause an increase in litigation and an increase in prices that investors or retirees must pay to gain access to retirement services.    ﻿   On April 7, 2017, the DOL issued a final rule delaying the applicability date of the DOL Fiduciary Rule and related exemptions from April 10, 2017 to June 9, 2017. This rule also changed some requirements of the rule initially released in April 2016, including (i) advisers relying on the Best Interest Contract Exemption will need to adhere to the Impartial Conduct Standards during the transition period of June 9, 2017 through January 1, 2018, but will not need to send certain disclosures to retirement investors during that time period and (ii) advisers will be permitted to rely on the current exemption (Permitted Transaction Exemption 84-24) until January 1, 2018 for the sale of all annuities and insurance, provided they adhere to that exemption’s Impartial Conduct Standards as of June 9, 2017. As the President's directive to the DOL mandated further study of the effects of the fiduciary rule on the retail retirement market, there may be additional changes to the DOL Fiduciary Rule and/or further delays to the dates.   ﻿   Liquidity and Capital Position   ﻿   Because we are a holding company with no direct operations, the inability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends to us in sufficient amounts would harm our ability to meet our obligations.   ﻿   We are a holding company and we have no direct operations. Our principal asset is the capital stock of our insurance subsidiaries. Our ability to meet our obligations for payment of interest and principal on outstanding debt obligations and to pay dividends to shareholders, repurchase our securities and pay corporate expenses depends primarily on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or to advance or repay funds to us. Under Indiana laws and regulations, our Indiana insurance subsidiaries, including Lincoln National Life Insurance Company (“LNL”), our primary insurance subsidiary, may pay dividends to us without prior approval of the Indiana Insurance Commissioner (the “Commissioner”) up to a certain threshold, or must receive prior approval of the Commissioner to pay a dividend if such dividend, along with all other dividends paid within the preceding 12 consecutive months, exceed the statutory limitation. The current Indiana statutory limitation is the greater of 10% of the insurer’s contract holders’ surplus, as shown on its last annual statement on file with the Commissioner, or the insurer’s statutory net gain from operations for the previous 12 months, but in no event to exceed statutory unassigned surplus.   ﻿   In addition, payments of dividends and advances or repayment of funds to us by our insurance subsidiaries are restricted by the applicable laws of their respective jurisdictions requiring that our insurance subsidiaries hold a specified amount of minimum reserves in order to meet future obligations on their outstanding policies. These regulations specify that the minimum reserves shall be calculated to be sufficient to meet future obligations, after giving consideration to future required premiums to be received, and are based on certain specified mortality and morbidity tables, interest rates and methods of valuation, which are subject to change. In order to meet their claims-paying obligations, our insurance subsidiaries regularly monitor their reserves to ensure we hold sufficient amounts to cover actual or expected contract and claims payments. At times, we may determine that reserves in excess of the minimum may be needed to ensure sufficiency.       89         Changes in, or reinterpretations of, these laws can constrain the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or to advance or repay funds to us in sufficient amounts and at times necessary to meet our debt obligations and corporate expenses. Requiring our insurance subsidiaries to hold additional reserves has the potential to constrain their ability to pay dividends to the holding company. See “Part I – Item 1. Risk Factors – Legislative, Regulatory and Tax – Attempts to mitigate the impact of Regulation XXX and Actuarial Guideline 38 may fail in whole or in part resulting in an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations” in our 2016 Form 10-K for additional information on potential changes in these laws.   ﻿   The earnings of our insurance subsidiaries impact contract holders’ surplus. Lower earnings constrain the growth in our insurance subsidiaries’ capital, and therefore, can constrain the payment of dividends and advances or repayment of funds to us.    ﻿   In addition, the amount of surplus that our insurance subsidiaries could pay as dividends is constrained by the amount of surplus they hold to maintain their financial strength ratings, to provide an additional layer of margin for risk protection and for future investment in our businesses. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we believe that our insurance subsidiaries have sufficient liquidity to meet their contract holder obligations and maintain their operations.   ﻿   Item 2.
