Item 1A. Risk Factors,” “Part II – Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and “Part II – Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data”; our quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed in 2016; and our current reports on Form 8-K filed in 2016. For more detailed information on the risks and uncertainties associated with the Company’s business activities, see the risks described in “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2015 Form 10-K as updated by “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our first quarter 2016 Form 10-Q.   ﻿   In this report, in addition to providing consolidated revenues and net income (loss), we also provide segment operating revenues and income (loss) from operations because we believe they are meaningful measures of revenues and the profitability of our operating segments. Financial information that follows is presented in accordance with United States of America generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), unless otherwise indicated. See Note 1 in our 2015 Form 10-K for a discussion of GAAP.   ﻿   Operating revenues and income (loss) from operations are the financial performance measures we use to evaluate and assess the results of our segments. Accordingly, we define and report operating revenues and income (loss) from operations by segment in Note 13. Our management believes that operating revenues and income (loss) from operations explain the results of our ongoing businesses in a manner that allows for a better understanding of the underlying trends in our current businesses because the excluded items are unpredictable and not necessarily indicative of current operating fundamentals or future performance of the business segments, and, in many instances, decisions regarding these items do not necessarily relate to the operations of the individual segments. In addition, we believe that our definitions of operating revenues and income (loss) from operations will provide investors with a more valuable measure of our performance because it better reveals trends in our business.    ﻿   FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS – CAUTIONARY LANGUAGE   ﻿   Certain statements made in this report and in other written or oral statements made by us or on our behalf are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (“PSLRA”). A forward-looking statement is a statement that is not a historical fact and, without limitation, includes any statement that may predict, forecast, indicate or imply future results, performance or achievements, and may contain words like: “believe,” “anticipate,” “expect,” “estimate,” “project,” “will,” “shall” and other words or phrases with similar meaning in connection with a discussion of future operating or financial performance. In particular, these include statements relating to future actions, trends in our businesses, prospective services or products, future performance or financial results and the outcome of contingencies, such as legal proceedings. We claim the protection afforded by the safe harbor for forward-looking statements provided by the PSLRA.    ﻿   Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from the results contained in the forward-looking statements. Risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to vary materially, some of which are described within the forward-looking statements, include, among others:    ﻿     ·    Deterioration in general economic and business conditions that may affect account values, investment results, guaranteed benefit liabilities, premium levels, claims experience and the level of pension benefit costs, funding and investment results;     ·    Adverse global capital and credit market conditions could affect our ability to raise capital, if necessary, and may cause us to realize impairments on investments and certain intangible assets, including goodwill and the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets, which may reduce future earnings and/or affect our financial condition and ability to raise additional capital or refinance existing debt as it matures;     ·    Because of our holding company structure, the inability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends to the holding company in sufficient amounts could harm the holding company’s ability to meet its obligations;    ·    Legislative, regulatory or tax changes, both domestic and foreign, that affect: the cost of, or demand for, our subsidiaries’ products, the required amount of reserves and/or surplus, our ability to conduct business and our captive reinsurance arrangements as well as restrictions on revenue sharing and 12b‑1 payments, the potential for U.S. federal tax reform and the effect of the Department of Labor’s (“DOL”) regulation defining fiduciary;    ·    Actions taken by reinsurers to raise rates on in-force business;     ·    Declines in or sustained low interest rates causing a reduction in investment income, the interest margins of our businesses, estimated gross profits (“EGPs”) and demand for our products;     ·    Rapidly increasing interest rates causing contract holders to surrender life insurance and annuity policies, thereby causing realized investment losses, and reduced hedge performance related to variable annuities;    ·    Uncertainty about the effect of rules and regulations to be promulgated under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank Act”) on us and the economy and financial services sector in particular;    ·    The initiation of legal or regulatory proceedings against us, and the outcome of any legal or regulatory proceedings, such as: adverse actions related to present or past business practices common in businesses in which we compete; adverse decisions in significant      47         actions including, but not limited to, actions brought by federal and state authorities and class action cases; new decisions that result in changes in law; and unexpected trial court rulings;    ·    A decline in the equity markets causing a reduction in the sales of our subsidiaries’ products, a reduction of asset-based fees that our subsidiaries charge on various investment and insurance products, an acceleration of the net amortization of deferred acquisition costs (“DAC”), value of business acquired (“VOBA”), deferred sales inducements (“DSI”) and deferred front-end loads (“DFEL”) and an increase in liabilities related to guaranteed benefit features of our subsidiaries’ variable annuity products;    ·    Ineffectiveness of our risk management policies and procedures, including various hedging strategies used to offset the effect of changes in the value of liabilities due to changes in the level and volatility of the equity markets and interest rates;    ·    A deviation in actual experience regarding future persistency, mortality, morbidity, interest rates or equity market returns from the assumptions used in pricing our subsidiaries’ products, in establishing related insurance reserves and in the net amortization of DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL, which may reduce future earnings;     ·    Changes in GAAP, including convergence with International Financial Reporting Standards, that may result in unanticipated changes to our net income;    ·    Lowering of one or more of our debt ratings issued by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations and the adverse effect such action may have on our ability to raise capital and on our liquidity and financial condition;    ·    Lowering of one or more of the insurer financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries and the adverse effect such action may have on the premium writings, policy retention, profitability of our insurance subsidiaries and liquidity;    ·    Significant credit, accounting, fraud, corporate governance or other issues that may adversely affect the value of certain investments in our portfolios, as well as counterparties to which we are exposed to credit risk, requiring that we realize losses on investments;    ·    Inability to protect our intellectual property rights or claims of infringement of the intellectual property rights of others;    ·    Interruption in telecommunication, information technology or other operational systems or failure to safeguard the confidentiality or privacy of sensitive data on such systems from cyberattacks or other breaches of our data security systems;    ·    The effect of acquisitions and divestitures, restructurings, product withdrawals and other unusual items;    ·    The adequacy and collectability of reinsurance that we have purchased;    ·    Acts of terrorism, a pandemic, war or other man-made and natural catastrophes that may adversely affect our businesses and the cost and availability of reinsurance;    ·    Competitive conditions, including pricing pressures, new product offerings and the emergence of new competitors, that may affect the level of premiums and fees that our subsidiaries can charge for their products;    ·    The unknown effect on our subsidiaries’ businesses resulting from changes in the demographics of their client base, as aging baby-boomers move from the asset-accumulation stage to the asset-distribution stage of life; and    ·    Loss of key management, financial planners or wholesalers.  ﻿   The risks included here are not exhaustive. Our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly report on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and other documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) include additional factors that could affect our businesses and financial performance. Moreover, we operate in a rapidly changing and competitive environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors.    ﻿   Further, it is not possible to assess the effect of all risk factors on our businesses or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results. In addition, we disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that occur after the date of this report.    ﻿   INTRODUCTION   ﻿   Executive Summary    ﻿   We are a holding company that operates multiple insurance and retirement businesses through subsidiary companies. Through our business segments, we sell a wide range of wealth protection, accumulation and retirement income products and solutions. These products include fixed and indexed annuities, variable annuities, universal life insurance (“UL”), variable universal life insurance (“VUL”), linked-benefit UL, indexed universal life insurance (“IUL”), term life insurance, employer-sponsored retirement plans and services, and group life, disability and dental.   ﻿   We provide products and services and report results through our Annuities, Retirement Plan Services, Life Insurance and Group Protection segments. We also have Other Operations. These segments and Other Operations are described in “Part I – Item 1. Business” of our 2015 Form 10-K.    ﻿   For information on how we derive our revenues, see the discussion in results of operations by segment below.   ﻿   Our current market conditions, significant operational matters, industry trends, issues and outlook are described in “Part II – Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Introduction – Executive Summary” of our 2015 Form 10-K.    ﻿       48            For factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in this section, see “Forward-Looking Statements – Cautionary Language” above and “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2015 Form 10-K as updated by “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our first quarter 2016 Form 10-Q.    ﻿   Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates   ﻿   The MD&A included in our 2015 Form 10-K contains a detailed discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates. The following information updates the “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” provided in our 2015 Form 10-K and, accordingly, should be read in conjunction with the “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” discussed in our 2015 Form 10-K.   ﻿   DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL   ﻿   Unlocking   ﻿   As stated in “Part II – Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Unlocking” in our 2015 Form 10-K, we conduct our annual comprehensive review of the assumptions and projection models underlying the amortization of DAC, VOBA, DSI, DFEL, embedded derivatives and reserves for life insurance and annuity products in the third quarter of each year. The profitability of our business depends, among other things, on assumptions regarding variable fund returns, investment margins, lapse rates and mortality.   ﻿   Reversion to the Mean   ﻿   As variable fund returns do not move in a systematic manner, we reset the baseline of account values from which EGPs are projected, which we refer to as our reversion to the mean (“RTM”) process, as discussed in our 2015 Form 10-K.    ﻿   If we had unlocked our RTM assumption as of June 30, 2016, we would have recorded a favorable unlocking of approximately $105 million, pre-tax, for Annuities, approximately $20 million, pre-tax, for Retirement Plan Services, and approximately $15 million, pre-tax, for Life Insurance.   ﻿   Investments   ﻿   Investment Valuation    ﻿   The following summarizes our available-for-sale (“AFS”) and trading securities and derivative investments carried at fair value by pricing source and fair value hierarchy level (in millions) as of June 30, 2016:   ﻿      ﻿                                                                      ﻿                                                                      ﻿    Quoted                                                      ﻿    Prices                                                      ﻿    in Active                                                      ﻿    Markets for    Significant    Significant                      ﻿    Identical    Observable    Unobservable                      ﻿    Assets    Inputs    Inputs        Total          ﻿    (Level 1)    (Level 2)    (Level 3)        Fair Value          Priced by third-party pricing services        $  759 				           $  79,808 				           $     -            $  80,567 				         Priced by independent broker quotations             -                 -              1,542 				             1,542 				         Priced by matrices             -              12,798 				                -              12,798 				         Priced by other methods (1)             -                 -              1,884 				             1,884 				         Total        $  759 				           $  92,606 				           $  3,426 				           $  96,791 				         ﻿                                                                      Percent of total          1% 				             96% 				             3% 				             100% 				        ﻿     (1)    Represents primarily securities for which pricing models were used to compute fair value.   ﻿   ﻿   For more information about the valuation of our financial instruments carried at fair value, see “Part II – Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Introduction – Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Investments – Investment Valuation” in our 2015 Form 10-K and Note 12 herein.   ﻿   As of June 30, 2016, we evaluated the markets that our securities trade in and concluded that none were inactive. We will continue to re-evaluate this conclusion, as needed, based on market conditions. We use unobservable inputs to measure the fair value of securities trading in less liquid or illiquid markets with limited or no pricing information. We obtain broker quotes for securities such as synthetic convertibles, index-linked certificates of deposit and collateralized debt obligations (“CDOs”) when sufficient security structure or other market information is not available to produce an evaluation. For broker-quoted only securities, non-binding quotes from market makers or broker-dealers are obtained from sources recognized as market participants. Broker-quoted securities are based solely on receipt of updated quotes from a single market maker or a broker-dealer recognized as a market participant. Our broker-quoted only securities are      49         generally classified as Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. As of June 30, 2016, we used broker quotes for 30 securities as our final price source, representing less than 1% of total securities owned.    ﻿   Derivatives    ﻿   Our accounting policies for derivatives and the potential effect on interest spreads in a falling rate environment are discussed in Note 5 of this report and “Part II – Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” in our 2015 Form 10-K.   ﻿   Guaranteed Living Benefits   ﻿   Within our individual annuity business, approximately 66% of our variable annuity account values contained guaranteed living benefits (“GLB”) features as of June 30, 2016. Underperforming equity markets increase our exposure to potential benefits with the GLB features. A contract with a GLB feature is “in the money” if the contract holder’s account balance falls below the present value of guaranteed withdrawal or income benefits, assuming no lapses. As of June 30, 2016 and 2015, 11% and 4%, respectively, of all in-force contracts with a GLB feature were “in the money,” and our exposure, after reinsurance, as of June 30, 2016 and 2015, was $724 million and $287 million, respectively. However, the only way the contract holder can realize the excess of the present value of benefits over the account value of the contract is through a series of withdrawals or income payments that do not exceed a maximum amount. If, after the series of withdrawals or income payments, the account value is exhausted, the contract holder will continue to receive a series of annuity payments. The account value can also fluctuate with equity market returns on a daily basis resulting in increases or decreases in the excess of the present value of benefits over account value.   ﻿   For information on our variable annuity hedge program performance, see our discussion in “Realized Gain (Loss) and Benefit Ratio Unlocking – Variable Annuity Net Derivatives Results” below.    ﻿   For information on our estimates of the potential instantaneous effect to net income, which could result from sudden changes that may occur in equity markets, interest rates and implied market volatilities, see our discussion in “Part II – Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Introduction – Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Derivatives – GLB” in our 2015 Form 10-K.   ﻿

(3)    Consists primarily of revenues attributable to broker-dealer services that are subject to market volatility.  ﻿   Comparison of the Three and Six Months Ended June 30, 2016 to 2015   ﻿   Income from operations for this segment decreased due primarily to the following:   ﻿     ·    Higher benefits attributable to an increase in the growth in benefit reserves due to lower average equity markets.    ·    Lower fee income driven by lower average daily variable account values as a result of lower average equity markets.  ﻿   The decrease in income from operations was partially offset primarily by lower commissions and other expenses driven by a decrease in amortization expense as a result of lower actual gross profits and amortization rates and lower incentive compensation as a result of production performance.   ﻿   We provide information about this segment’s operating revenue and operating expense line items, the period in which amounts are recognized, key drivers of changes and historical details underlying the line items and their associated drivers below.    ﻿   See the Variable Account Value Information table within “Fee Income” below for drivers of changes in our variable account values and the Fixed Account Value Information table within “Net Investment Income and Interest Credited” below for drivers of changes in our fixed account values.   ﻿   Additional Information   ﻿   New deposits are an important component of net flows and key to our efforts to grow our business. Although deposits do not significantly affect current period income from operations, they can significantly impact future income from operations. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, 29% and 27% of our variable annuity deposits were on products without GLB riders, respectively, compared to 28% for the corresponding periods in 2015. As a result of the more volatile market environment, our variable annuity deposits for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, were significantly lower than the corresponding periods in 2015 resulting in negative net flows.   ﻿   The other component of net flows relates to the retention of the business. An important measure of retention is the lapse rate, which compares the amount of withdrawals to the average account values. The overall lapse rate for our annuity products was 6% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, compared to 7% for the corresponding periods in 2015.   ﻿       52         Our fixed annuity business includes products with discretionary crediting rates that are reset on an annual basis and are not subject to surrender charges. Our ability to retain annual reset annuities will be subject to current competitive conditions at the time interest rates for these products reset. We expect to manage the effects of spreads on near-term income from operations through portfolio management and, to a lesser extent, crediting rate actions, which assumes no significant changes in net flows into or out of our fixed accounts or other changes that may cause interest rate spreads to differ from our expectations.

These assessments are a function of the rates priced into the product and the average daily variable account values. Average daily account values are driven by net flows and variable fund returns. Charges on GLB riders are assessed based on a contractual rate      53         that is applied either to the account value or the guaranteed amount. In addition, for our fixed annuity contracts and for some variable contracts, we collect surrender charges when contract holders surrender their contracts during their surrender charge periods to protect us from premature withdrawals.

Fluctuations in these expenses correspond with fluctuations in other revenues.   ﻿       56            RESULTS OF RETIREMENT PLAN SERVICES   ﻿   Income (Loss) from Operations   ﻿   Details underlying the results for Retirement Plan Services (in millions) were as follows:   ﻿      ﻿                                                                      ﻿                                                                      ﻿    For the Three                 For the Six                  ﻿    Months Ended                 Months Ended                   ﻿    June 30,                June 30,                  ﻿    2016        2015        Change        2016        2015        Change          Operating Revenues                                                                      Fee income    $  57 				       $  61 				       -7%        $  112 				       $  123 				       -9%          Net investment income      209 				         206 				     1% 				         417 				         414 				     1% 				         Other revenues (1)      4 				         3 				     33% 				         8 				         6 				     33% 				         Total operating revenues      270 				         270 				     0% 				         537 				         543 				       -1%          Operating Expenses                                                                      Interest credited      127 				         123 				     3% 				         251 				         245 				     2% 				         Benefits         -          1 				       -100%          1 				         1 				     0% 				         Commissions and other expenses      102 				         107 				       -5%          202 				         209 				       -3%          Total operating expenses      229 				         231 				       -1%          454 				         455 				     0% 				         Income (loss) from operations before taxes      41 				         39 				     5% 				         83 				         88 				       -6%          Federal income tax expense (benefit)      10 				         9 				     11% 				         22 				         23 				       -4%          Income (loss) from operations    $  31 				       $  30 				     3% 				       $  61 				       $  65 				       -6%         ﻿     (1)    Consists primarily of mutual fund account program revenues from mid to large employers.  ﻿   Comparison of the Three Months Ended June 30, 2016 to 2015   ﻿   Income from operations for this segment increased due primarily to lower commissions and other expenses driven by a decrease in amortization expense as a result of lower actual gross profits and amortization rates, partially offset by lower fee income driven by lower average daily variable account values as a result of lower average equity markets.   ﻿   Comparison of the Six Months Ended June 30, 2016 to 2015   ﻿   Income from operations for this segment decreased due primarily to the following:    ﻿     ·    Lower fee income driven by lower average daily variable account values as a result of lower average equity markets.    ·    Lower net investment income, net of interest credited, driven by lower prepayment and bond make-whole premiums and spread compression due to average new money rates trailing our current portfolio yields, partially offset by higher average fixed account values.  ﻿   The decrease in income from operations was partially offset by lower commissions and other expenses driven by a decrease in amortization expense as a result of lower actual gross profits and amortization rates.    ﻿   We provide information about this segment’s operating revenue and operating expense line items, the period in which amounts are recognized, key drivers of changes and historical details underlying the line items and their associated drivers below.    ﻿   See the Variable Account Value Information table within “Fee Income” below for drivers of changes in our variable account values and the Fixed Account Value Information table within “Net Investment Income and Interest Credited” below for drivers of changes in our fixed account values.   ﻿   See “Consolidated Investments – Commercial Mortgage Loan Prepayment and Bond Make-Whole Premiums” below for more information on prepayment and bond make-whole premiums.   ﻿   Additional Information   ﻿   Net flows in this business fluctuate based on the timing of larger plans being implemented on our platform and terminating over the course of the year.       New deposits are an important component of net flows and key to our efforts to grow our business. Although deposits do not significantly affect current period income from operations, they are an important indicator of future profitability.  The other component of net flows relates to the retention of the business. An important measure of retention is the lapse rate, which compares the amount of      57         withdrawals to the average account values. The overall lapse rate for the business was 12% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, compared to 11% for the corresponding periods in 2015.    ﻿   Our net flows are negatively affected by the continued net outflows from our oldest blocks of annuities business (as presented on our Account Value Roll Forward table below as “Multi-Fund® and Other”), which are also our highest margin product lines in this segment, due to the fact that they are mature blocks with low distribution and servicing costs. The proportion of these products to our total account values was 29% and 30% as of June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Due to this expected overall shift in business mix toward products with lower returns, a significant increase in new deposit production continues to be necessary to maintain earnings at current levels.    ﻿   Our fixed annuity business includes products with discretionary and index-based crediting rates that are reset on either a quarterly or semi-annual basis. Our ability to retain quarterly or semi-annual reset annuities will be subject to current competitive conditions at the time interest rates for these products reset. We expect to manage the effects of spreads on near-term income from operations through portfolio management and, to a lesser extent, crediting rate actions, which assumes no significant changes in net flows into or out of our fixed accounts or other changes that may cause interest rate spreads to differ from our expectations.

Term products and UL products containing secondary guarantees require reserves calculated pursuant to the Valuation of Life Insurance Policies Model Regulation (“XXX”) and Actuarial Guideline 38 (“AG38”), respectively. For information on strategies we use to reduce      63         the statutory reserve strain caused by XXX and AG38, see “Review of Consolidated Financial Condition – Sources of Liquidity and Cash Flow – Insurance Subsidiaries’ Statutory Capital and Surplus” below.       Additional Information   ﻿   After experiencing elevated mortality due primarily to claims seasonality and higher claims severity during the first quarter of 2016, mortality was in line with our expectations during the second quarter of 2016.   ﻿   For information on interest rate spreads and interest rate risk, see “Item 3.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – Interest Rate Risk – Interest Rate Risk on Fixed Insurance Businesses – Falling Rates” and “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors – Market Conditions – Changes in interest rates and sustained low interest rates may cause interest rate spreads to decrease and changes in interest rates may also result in increased contract withdrawals” in our 2015 Form 10-K.   ﻿   For factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in this section, see “Forward-Looking Statements – Cautionary Language” above and “Part I – Item 1A.

Generally, we have higher sales during the second half of the year with the fourth quarter being our strongest.    ﻿   Sales in the table above and as discussed above were reported as follows:   ﻿     ·    Linked-benefit – 15% of total expected premium deposits;    ·    UL, IUL and VUL – first year commissionable premiums plus 5% of excess premiums received, including an adjustment for internal replacements of approximately 50% of commissionable premiums;    ·    Executive Benefits – single premium bank-owned UL and VUL, 15% of single premium deposits, and corporate owned UL and VUL, first year commissionable premiums plus 5% of excess premium received, including an adjustment for internal replacements of approximately 50% of commissionable premiums; and    ·    Term – 100% of annualized first year premiums.  ﻿   We monitor the business environment, including but not limited to the regulatory and interest rate environments, and make changes to our product offerings and inforce products as needed, and as permitted under the policies, to sustain the future profitability of our segment. We continue to focus on maintaining our diversified balance of life sales across all products, with an emphasis on products without long-term guarantees. Individual life sales without long-term guarantees were 66% and 67% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, compared to 66% and 62% for the corresponding periods in 2015.   ﻿       65            Net Investment Income and Interest Credited   ﻿   Details underlying net investment income, interest credited (in millions) and our interest rate spread were as follows:   ﻿      ﻿                                                                      ﻿                                                                      ﻿    For the Three                For the Six                  ﻿    Months Ended                Months Ended                  ﻿    June 30,                June 30,                  ﻿    2016        2015        Change        2016        2015        Change          Net Investment Income                                                                      Fixed maturity securities, mortgage loans                                                                      on real estate and other, net of                                                                      investment expenses    $  578 				       $  567 				     2% 				       $  1,159 				       $  1,137 				     2% 				         Commercial mortgage loan prepayment                                                                      and bond make-whole premiums (1)      6 				         4 				     50% 				         13 				         22 				       -41%          Alternative investments (2)      11 				         17 				       -35%          2 				         22 				       -91%          Surplus investments (3)      38 				         38 				     0% 				         70 				         70 				     0% 				         Total net investment income    $  633 				       $  626 				     1% 				       $  1,244 				       $  1,251 				       -1%          ﻿                                                                      Interest Credited    $  349 				       $  345 				     1% 				       $  697 				       $  683 				     2% 				        ﻿     (1)    See “Consolidated Investments – Commercial Mortgage Loan Prepayment and Bond Make-Whole Premiums” below for additional information.

Statutory reserves will typically grow at a faster rate than account values because of the AG38 reserve requirements. Invested assets are based upon the statutory reserve liabilities and are affected by various reserve adjustments, including financing transactions providing relief from AG38 reserve requirements.  These financing transactions lead to a transfer of invested assets from this segment to Other Operations. We expect to earn a spread between what we earn on the underlying general account investments and what we credit to our contract holders’ accounts. We use our investment income to offset the earnings effect of the associated growth of our policy reserves for traditional products. Commercial mortgage loan prepayments and bond make-whole premiums and investment income on alternative investments can vary significantly from period to period due to a number of factors, and, therefore, may contribute to investment income results that are not indicative of the underlying trends.   ﻿   Benefits   ﻿   Details underlying benefits (dollars in millions) were as follows:   ﻿      ﻿                                                                      ﻿                                                                      ﻿    For the Three                For the Six                  ﻿    Months Ended                Months Ended                  ﻿    June 30,                June 30,                  ﻿    2016        2015        Change        2016        2015        Change          Benefits                                                                      Death claims direct and assumed    $  1,049 				       $  1,050 				     0% 				       $  2,140 				       $  2,050 				     4% 				         Death claims ceded      (438 				   )      (464 				   )  6% 				         (888 				   )      (879 				   )    -1%          Reserves released on death      (171 				   )      (149 				   )    -15%          (318 				   )      (293 				   )    -9%          Net death benefits      440 				         437 				     1% 				         934 				         878 				     6% 				         Change in secondary guarantee life                                                                      insurance product reserves      150 				         142 				     6% 				         291 				         284 				     2% 				         Change in linked-benefit product reserves      51 				         31 				     65% 				         99 				         60 				     65% 				         Other benefits (1)      67 				         63 				     6% 				         124 				         101 				     23% 				         Total benefits    $  708 				       $  673 				     5% 				       $  1,448 				       $  1,323 				     9% 				         ﻿                                                                      Death claims per $1,000 of in-force      2.62 				         2.70 				       -3%          2.80 				         2.73 				     3% 				        ﻿     (1)    Includes primarily changes in reserves and dividends on traditional and other products.  ﻿   Benefits for this segment include claims incurred during the period in excess of the associated reserves for its interest-sensitive and traditional products. In addition, benefits include the change in secondary guarantee and linked-benefit life insurance product reserves. These reserves are affected by changes in expected future trends of assessments and benefits causing unlocking adjustments to these liabilities similar to DAC, VOBA and DFEL.

When comparing DAC and VOBA deferrals as a percentage of sales for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, to the corresponding periods in 2015, the increase was primarily a result of changes in sales mix to products with higher commission rates.   ﻿       68            RESULTS OF GROUP PROTECTION   ﻿   Income (Loss) from Operations   ﻿   Details underlying the results for Group Protection (in millions) were as follows:   ﻿   ﻿      ﻿                                                                      ﻿                                                                      ﻿    For the Three                 For the Six                  ﻿    Months Ended                 Months Ended                   ﻿    June 30,                June 30,                  ﻿    2016        2015        Change        2016        2015        Change          Operating Revenues                                                                      Insurance premiums    $  478 				       $  567 				       -16%        $  967 				       $  1,128 				       -14%          Net investment income      43 				         47 				       -9%          86 				         90 				       -4%          Other revenues      4 				         3 				     33% 				         6 				         4 				     50% 				         Total operating revenues      525 				         617 				       -15%          1,059 				         1,222 				       -13%          Operating Expenses                                                                      Interest credited      1 				         1 				     0% 				         1 				         1 				     0% 				         Benefits      345 				         421 				       -18%          685 				         862 				       -21%          Commissions and other expenses      156 				         165 				       -5%          342 				         339 				     1% 				         Total operating expenses      502 				         587 				       -14%          1,028 				         1,202 				       -14%          Income (loss) from operations before taxes      23 				         30 				       -23%          31 				         20 				     55% 				         Federal income tax expense (benefit)      8 				         11 				       -27%          11 				         7 				     57% 				         Income (loss) from operations    $  15 				       $  19 				       -21%        $  20 				       $  13 				     54% 				        ﻿   ﻿   ﻿      ﻿                                                                      ﻿                                                                      ﻿    For the Three                For the Six                  ﻿    Months Ended                Months Ended                  ﻿    June 30,                June 30,                  ﻿    2016        2015        Change        2016        2015        Change          Income (Loss) from Operations by                                                                      Product Line                                                                      Life    $  8 				       $  9 				       -11%        $  5 				       $  6 				       -17%          Disability      7 				         9 				       -22%          15 				         5 				     200% 				         Dental         -

We expect normal fluctuations in our total non-medical loss ratio, as claims experience is inherently uncertain. For every one percent increase in the total non-medical loss ratio, we would expect an approximate annual $12 million to $14 million decrease to income from operations.        69         ﻿   For information on the effects of current interest rates on our long-term disability claim reserves, see “Item 7A.

Business in force, in turn, is driven by sales and persistency experience.    ﻿   Sales relate to new contract holders and new programs sold to existing contract holders. We believe that the trend in sales is an important indicator of development of business in force over time. Sales in the table above are the combined annualized premiums for our life, disability and dental products.    ﻿   Net Investment Income   ﻿   We use our investment income to offset the earnings effect of the associated build of our reserves, which are a function of our insurance premiums and the yields on our invested assets.   ﻿       70            Benefits and Interest Credited   ﻿   Details underlying benefits and interest credited (in millions) and loss ratios by product line were as follows:   ﻿   Generally, we have higher mortality in the first quarter of the year due to the seasonality of claims.   ﻿   ﻿      ﻿                                                                      ﻿                                                                      ﻿    For the Three                For the Six                  ﻿    Months Ended                Months Ended                  ﻿    June 30,                June 30,                  ﻿    2016        2015        Change        2016        2015        Change          Benefits and Interest Credited by                                                                      Product Line                                                                      Life    $  141 				       $  166 				       -15%        $  291 				       $  345 				       -16%          Disability      165 				         186 				       -11%          314 				         383 				       -18%          Dental      40 				         42 				       -5%          81 				         84 				       -4%          Total non-medical      346 				         394 				       -12%          686 				         812 				       -16%          Medical         -          28 				       -100%             -          51 				       -100%          Total benefits and interest credited     $  346 				       $  422 				       -18%        $  686 				       $  863 				       -21%          ﻿                                                                      Loss Ratios by Product Line                                                                      Life      70.4% 				         72.0% 				                 70.8% 				         74.8% 				                 Disability      74.8% 				         75.4% 				                 71.0% 				         77.5% 				                 Dental      70.4% 				         72.3% 				                 71.9% 				         72.6% 				                 Total non-medical      72.5% 				         73.6% 				                 71.0% 				         75.8% 				                ﻿   Commissions and Other Expenses    ﻿   Details underlying commissions and other expenses (in millions) were as follows:   ﻿   ﻿      ﻿                                                                      ﻿                                                                      ﻿    For the Three                For the Six                  ﻿    Months Ended                Months Ended                  ﻿    June 30,                June 30,                  ﻿    2016        2015        Change        2016        2015        Change          Commissions and Other Expenses                                                                      Commissions    $  61 				       $  69 				       -12%        $  124 				       $  135 				       -8%          General and administrative expenses      83 				         80 				     4% 				         161 				         158 				     2% 				         Taxes, licenses and fees      14 				         13 				     8% 				         28 				         29 				       -3%          Total expenses incurred      158 				         162 				       -2%          313 				         322 				       -3%          DAC deferrals      (17 				   )      (12 				   )    -42%          (31 				   )      (30 				   )    -3%          Total expenses recognized before                                                                      amortization      141 				         150 				       -6%          282 				         292 				       -3%          DAC and VOBA amortization, net of                                                                      interest      15 				         15 				     0% 				         60 				         47 				     28% 				         Total commissions and                                                                      other expenses    $  156 				       $  165 				       -5%        $  342 				       $  339 				     1% 				         ﻿                                                                      DAC Deferrals                                                                      As a percentage of insurance premiums      3.6% 				         2.1% 				                 3.2% 				         2.7% 				                ﻿   Commissions and other costs that result directly from and are essential to the successful acquisition of new or renewal business are deferred to the extent recoverable and are amortized in relation to the revenues of the related contracts.

The level of expenses is an important driver of profitability for this segment as group insurance contracts are offered within an environment that competes on the basis of price and service.

Risk Factors” in our 2015 Form 10-K as updated by “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our first quarter 2016 Form 10-Q.   ﻿   Net Investment Income and Interest Credited    ﻿   We utilize an internal formula to determine the amount of capital that is allocated to our business segments. Investment income on capital in excess of the calculated amounts is reported in Other Operations. If our business segments require increases in statutory reserves, surplus or investments, the amount of excess capital that is retained by Other Operations would decrease and net investment income would be negatively affected.   ﻿   Write-downs for OTTI decrease the recorded value of our invested assets owned by the business segments. These write-downs are not included in the income from operations of our business segments. When impairment occurs, assets are transferred to the business      72         segments’ portfolios and will reduce the future net investment income for Other Operations. Statutory reserve adjustments for our business segments can also cause allocations of invested assets between the business segments and Other Operations.       The majority of our interest credited relates to our reinsurance operations sold to Swiss Re Life & Health America, Inc. (“Swiss Re”) in 2001. A substantial amount of the business was sold through indemnity reinsurance transactions, which is still recorded in our consolidated financial statements. The interest credited corresponds to investment income earnings on the assets we continue to hold for this business.

We follow a balanced approach to investing for both current income and prudent risk management, with an emphasis on generating sufficient current income, net of income tax, to meet our obligations to customers, as well as other general liabilities. This balanced approach requires the evaluation of expected return and risk of each asset class utilized, while still meeting our income objectives. This approach is important to our asset-liability management because decisions can be made based upon both the economic and current investment income considerations affecting assets and liabilities.  For a discussion of our risk management process, see “Part II – Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” in our 2015 Form 10-K.   ﻿   Investment Portfolio Composition and Diversification   ﻿   Fundamental to our investment policy is diversification across asset classes. Our investment portfolio, excluding cash and invested cash, is composed of fixed maturity securities, mortgage loans on real estate, real estate (either wholly-owned or in joint ventures) and other long-term investments. We purchase investments for our segmented portfolios that have yield, duration and other characteristics that take into account the liabilities of the products being supported.    ﻿   We have the ability to maintain our investment holdings throughout credit cycles because of our capital position, the long-term nature of our liabilities and the matching of our portfolios of investment assets with the liabilities of our various products.        76            Fixed Maturity and Equity Securities Portfolios   ﻿   Fixed maturity and equity securities consist of portfolios classified as AFS and trading. Details underlying our fixed maturity and equity securities portfolios by industry classification (in millions) are presented in the tables below. These tables agree in total with the presentation of AFS securities in Note 4; however, the categories below represent a more detailed breakout of the AFS portfolio. Therefore, the investment classifications listed below do not agree to the investment categories provided in Note 4.   ﻿      ﻿                                                              ﻿                                                              ﻿    As of June 30, 2016          ﻿                Gross Unrealized                    %          ﻿    Amortized                Losses and        Fair        Fair          ﻿    Cost        Gains        OTTI (2)        Value        Value          Fixed Maturity AFS Securities                                                              Industry corporate bonds:                                                              Financial services    $  10,728 				       $  1,039 				       $  60 				       $  11,707 				     12.7% 				         Basic industry      4,644 				         347 				         87 				         4,904 				     5.3% 				         Capital goods      5,481 				         664 				         9 				         6,136 				     6.7% 				         Communications      4,268 				         471 				         45 				         4,694 				     5.1% 				         Consumer cyclical      5,401 				         520 				         47 				         5,874 				     6.4% 				         Consumer non-cyclical      12,437 				         1,416 				         20 				         13,833 				     15.0% 				         Energy      7,634 				         487 				         301 				         7,820 				     8.5% 				         Technology      3,245 				         220 				         18 				         3,447 				     3.8% 				         Transportation      2,717 				         259 				         5 				         2,971 				     3.2% 				         Industrial other      834 				         71 				         2 				         903 				     1.0% 				         Utilities      12,048 				         1,689 				         7 				         13,730 				     14.9% 				         Government related entities      2,720 				         325 				         13 				         3,032 				     3.3% 				         Collateralized mortgage and other obligations ("CMOs"):                                                              Agency backed      1,180 				         134 				            -

(2)    Includes unrealized gains and (losses) on impaired securities related to changes in the fair value of such securities subsequent to the impairment measurement date.  ﻿       78            AFS Securities   ﻿   In accordance with the AFS accounting guidance, we reflect stockholders’ equity as if unrealized gains and losses were actually recognized, and consider all related accounting adjustments that would occur upon such a hypothetical recognition of unrealized gains and losses. Such related balance sheet effects include adjustments to the balances of DAC, VOBA, DFEL, future contract benefits, other contract holder funds and deferred income taxes. Adjustments to each of these balances are charged or credited to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). For instance, DAC is adjusted upon the recognition of unrealized gains or losses because the    amortization of DAC is based upon an assumed emergence of gross profits on certain insurance business. Deferred income tax balances are also adjusted because unrealized gains or losses do not affect actual taxes currently paid.    ﻿   The quality of our AFS fixed maturity securities portfolio, as measured at estimated fair value and by the percentage of fixed maturity AFS securities invested in various ratings categories, relative to the entire fixed maturity AFS security portfolio (in millions) was as follows:   ﻿      ﻿                                                                                  ﻿                                                                                  ﻿        Rating Agency        As of June 30, 2016        As of December 31, 2015          NAIC        Equivalent        Amortized        Fair        % of        Amortized        Fair        % of          Designation (1)        Designation (1)        Cost        Value        Total        Cost        Value        Total          ﻿                                                                                  Investment Grade Securities                                                                          1        Aaa / Aa / A        $  45,199 				       $  51,358 				     55.8% 				       $  44,614 				       $  47,845 				     55.9% 				         2        Baa          34,026 				         36,603 				     39.7% 				         33,918 				         34,077 				     39.8% 				         Total investment grade securities          79,225 				         87,961 				     95.5% 				         78,532 				         81,922 				     95.7% 				         ﻿                                                                                  Below Investment Grade Securities                                                                          3        Ba          2,697 				         2,622 				     2.9% 				         2,707 				         2,486 				     2.9% 				         4        B          1,309 				         1,150 				     1.3% 				         1,140 				         988 				     1.2% 				         5        Caa and lower          243 				         191 				     0.2% 				         188 				         146 				     0.2% 				         6        In or near default          157 				         137 				     0.1% 				         22 				         20 				     0.0% 				         Total below investment grade securities          4,406 				         4,100 				     4.5% 				         4,057 				         3,640 				     4.3% 				         Total fixed maturity AFS securities        $  83,631 				       $  92,061 				     100.0% 				       $  82,589 				       $  85,562 				     100.0% 				         ﻿                                                                                  Total securities below investment                                                                          grade as a percentage of total                                                                          fixed maturity AFS securities          5.3% 				         4.5% 				                 4.9% 				         4.3% 				                ﻿     (1)    Based upon the rating designations determined and provided by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”) or the major credit rating agencies (Fitch Ratings (“Fitch”), Moody’s Investors Service (“Moody’s”) and Standard & Poor’s (“S&P”)).  For securities where the ratings assigned by the major credit rating agencies are not equivalent, the second highest rating assigned is used.  For those securities where ratings by the major credit rating agencies are not available, which does not represent a significant amount of our total fixed maturity AFS securities, we base the ratings disclosed upon internal ratings. The average credit quality was A- as of June 30, 2016.   ﻿   Comparisons between the NAIC ratings and rating agency designations are published by the NAIC. The NAIC assigns securities quality ratings and uniform valuations, which are used by insurers when preparing their annual statements. The NAIC ratings are similar to the rating agency designations of the Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations for marketable bonds. NAIC ratings 1 and 2 include bonds generally considered investment grade (rated Baa3 or higher by Moody’s, or rated BBB- or higher by S&P and Fitch) by such ratings organizations. However, securities rated NAIC 1 and 2 could be deemed below investment grade by the rating agencies as a result of the current RBC rules for residential mortgage-backed securities (“RMBS”) and CMBS for statutory reporting. NAIC ratings 3 through 6 include bonds generally considered below investment grade (rated Ba or lower by Moody’s, or rated BB+ or lower by S&P and Fitch).    ﻿   As of June 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, 73.6% and 91.8%, respectively, of the total publicly traded and private securities in an unrealized loss status were rated as investment grade. Our gross unrealized losses, including the portion of OTTI recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) (“OCI”), on AFS securities as of June 30, 2016, decreased by $1.4 billion since December 31, 2015. As more fully described in Note 1 in our 2015 Form 10-K, we regularly review our investment holdings for OTTI. We believe the unrealized loss position as of June 30, 2016, does not represent OTTI as: (i) we do not intend to sell the debt securities; (ii) it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the debt securities before recovery of their amortized cost; (iii) the estimated future cash flows are equal to or greater than the amortized cost of the debt securities; and (iv) we have the ability and intent to hold the equity securities for a period of time sufficient for recovery.

than not that we will be required to sell the fixed maturity AFS securities before recovery of their amortized cost; (ii) that the estimated future cash flows are equal to or greater than the amortized cost of the debt securities; and (iii) that we have the ability to hold the equity AFS securities for a period of time sufficient for recovery. This conclusion is consistent with our asset-liability management process. Management considers the following as part of the evaluation:   ﻿     ·    The current economic environment and market conditions;    ·    Our business strategy and current business plans;    ·    The nature and type of security, including expected maturities and exposure to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risk;    ·    Our analysis of data from financial models and other internal and industry sources to evaluate the current effectiveness of our hedging and overall risk management strategies;    ·    The current and expected timing of contractual maturities of our assets and liabilities, expectations of prepayments on investments and expectations for surrenders and withdrawals of life insurance policies and annuity contracts;    ·    The capital risk limits approved by management; and    ·    Our current financial condition and liquidity demands.  ﻿   To determine the recoverability of a debt security, we consider the facts and circumstances surrounding the underlying issuer including, but not limited to, the following:   ﻿     ·    Historical and implied volatility of the security;    ·    Length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than amortized cost;     ·    Adverse conditions specifically related to the security or to specific conditions in an industry or geographic area;     ·    Failure, if any, of the issuer of the security to make scheduled payments; and    ·    Recoveries or additional declines in fair value subsequent to the balance sheet date.   ﻿   As reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, we had $114.7 billion of investments and cash, which exceeded the liabilities for our future obligations under insurance policies and contracts, net of amounts recoverable from reinsurers, which totaled $94.1 billion as of June 30, 2016. If it were necessary to liquidate investments prior to maturity or call to meet cash flow needs, we would first look to AFS securities that are in an unrealized gain position, which had a fair value of $83.4 billion, excluding consolidated VIEs in the amount of $600 million, as of June 30, 2016, rather than selling securities in an unrealized loss position. The amount of cash that we have on hand takes into account our liquidity needs in the future, other sources of cash, such as the maturities of investments, interest and dividends we earn on our investments and the ongoing cash flows from new and existing business.    ﻿   See “AFS Securities – Evaluation for Recovery of Amortized Cost” in Note 1 in our 2015 Form 10-K and Note 4 herein for additional discussion.   ﻿   As of June 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, the estimated fair value for all private placement securities was $14.5 billion and $14.0 billion, respectively, representing 14% of total invested assets.   ﻿   For information regarding our VIEs’ fixed maturity securities, see Note 4 in our 2015 Form 10-K and Note 3 herein.    ﻿       81         Mortgage-Backed Securities (Included in AFS and Trading Securities)   ﻿   See “Part II – Item 7.

AFS securities represented $532 million, or 98%, and trading securities represented $9 million, or 2%, of the subprime exposure as of June 30, 2016.

For securities where the ratings assigned by the major credit rating agencies are not equivalent, the second highest rating assigned is used. For those securities where ratings by the major credit rating agencies are not available, which does not represent a significant amount of our total fixed maturity AFS securities, we base the ratings disclosed upon internal ratings.   ﻿   None of these investments included any direct investments in subprime lenders or mortgages.

For securities where the ratings assigned by the major credit agencies are not equivalent, the second highest rating assigned is used. For those securities where ratings by the major credit rating agencies are not available, which does not represent a significant amount of our total fixed maturity AFS securities, we base the ratings disclosed upon internal ratings.   ﻿   As of June 30, 2016, the fair value and amortized cost of our AFS exposure to Monoline insurers was $516 million and $468 million, respectively.    ﻿   Composition by Industry Categories of our Unrealized Losses on AFS Securities   ﻿   When considering unrealized gain and loss information, it is important to recognize that the information relates to the status of securities at a particular point in time and may not be indicative of the status of our investment portfolios subsequent to the balance sheet date. Further, because the timing of the recognition of realized investment gains and losses through the selection of which securities are sold is largely at management’s discretion, it is important to consider the information provided below within the context of the overall unrealized gain or loss position of our investment portfolios. These are important considerations that should be included in any evaluation of the potential effect of securities in an unrealized loss position on our future earnings.    ﻿       83         The composition by industry categories of all securities in an unrealized loss position (in millions) as of June 30, 2016, was as follows:   ﻿      ﻿                                                                  ﻿                                                      ﻿                                            %          ﻿                                    Gross        Gross          ﻿            %                %        Unrealized        Unrealized          ﻿    Fair        Fair        Amortized        Amortized        Losses        Losses          ﻿    Value        Value        Cost        Cost        and OTTI        and OTTI          Oil field services    $  487 				     5.8% 				       $  617 				     6.7% 				       $  130 				     16.9% 				         Independent      1,031 				     12.3% 				         1,148 				     12.6% 				         117 				     15.2% 				         Banking      412 				     4.9% 				         492 				     5.4% 				         80 				     10.4% 				         Metals and mining      589 				     7.0% 				         662 				     7.3% 				         73 				     9.5% 				         CMOs      696 				     8.3% 				         740 				     8.1% 				         44 				     5.7% 				         ABS      801 				     9.6% 				         841 				     9.2% 				         40 				     5.2% 				         Midstream      570 				     6.8% 				         602 				     6.6% 				         32 				     4.2% 				         Retailers      61 				     0.7% 				         84 				     0.9% 				         23 				     3.0% 				         Property and casualty      116 				     1.4% 				         138 				     1.5% 				         22 				     2.9% 				         Integrated      157 				     1.9% 				         178 				     1.9% 				         21 				     2.7% 				         Technology      340 				     4.1% 				         356 				     3.9% 				         16 				     2.1% 				         Media – entertainment      257 				     3.0% 				         272 				     3.0% 				         15 				     2.0% 				         Cable – satellite       154 				     1.9% 				         168 				     1.8% 				         14 				     1.8% 				         Wirelines      48 				     0.6% 				         59 				     0.6% 				         11 				     1.4% 				         Chemicals      310 				     3.7% 				         320 				     3.5% 				         10 				     1.3% 				         Government owned, no guarantee      102 				     1.2% 				         112 				     1.2% 				         10 				     1.3% 				         Industries with unrealized losses                                                                  less than $10 million      2,246 				     26.8% 				         2,356 				     25.8% 				         110 				     14.4% 				         Total by industry    $  8,377 				     100.0% 				       $  9,145 				     100.0% 				       $  768 				     100.0% 				         ﻿                                                                  Total by industry as a percentage                                                                  of total AFS securities      9.1% 				                 10.9% 				                 100.0% 				                ﻿   As of June 30, 2016, the fair value and amortized cost of securities subject to enhanced analysis and monitoring for potential changes in unrealized loss position was $441 million and $521 million, respectively.    ﻿   Mortgage Loans on Real Estate   ﻿   The following tables summarize key information on mortgage loans on real estate (in millions):   ﻿      ﻿                                              ﻿                                              ﻿    As of June 30, 2016        As of December 31, 2015          ﻿    Carrying                Carrying                  ﻿    Value        %        Value        %          Credit Quality Indicator                                              Current    $  9,253 				     100.0% 				       $  8,678 				     100.0% 				         Delinquent and/or in foreclosure (1)      4 				     0.0% 				            -      0.0% 				         Total mortgage loans on real estate    $  9,257 				     100.0% 				       $  8,678 				     100.0% 				        ﻿     (1)    As of June 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, there were two and zero mortgage loans on real estate that were delinquent and in foreclosure, respectively.  ﻿       84            As of June 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, there were two impaired mortgage loans on real estate, or less than 1% of the total dollar amount of mortgage loans on real estate.

The profitability of our fixed annuity and life insurance products is affected by our ability to achieve target spreads, or margins, between the interest income earned on the general account assets and the interest credited to the contract holder on our average fixed account values, including the fixed portion of variable. Net investment income and the interest rate yield table each include commercial mortgage loan prepayments and bond make-whole premiums, alternative investments and contingent interest and standby real estate equity commitments. These items can vary significantly from period to period due to a number of factors and, therefore, can provide results that are not indicative of the underlying trends.   ﻿   Commercial Mortgage Loan Prepayment and Bond Make-Whole Premiums   ﻿   Prepayment and make-whole premiums are collected when borrowers elect to call or prepay their debt prior to the stated maturity. A prepayment or make-whole premium allows investors to attain the same yield as if the borrower made all scheduled interest payments until maturity. These premiums are designed to make investors indifferent to prepayment.   ﻿   Realized Gain (Loss) Related to Certain Investments   ﻿   Details of the realized gain (loss) related to certain investments (in millions) were as follows:   ﻿      ﻿                                                                      ﻿                                                                      ﻿    For the Three                For the Six                  ﻿    Months Ended                Months Ended                  ﻿    June 30,                June 30,                  ﻿    2016        2015        Change        2016        2015        Change          Fixed maturity AFS securities: (1)                                                                      Gross gains    $  7 				       $  21 				       -67%        $  61 				       $  23 				     165% 				         Gross losses      (65 				   )      (13 				   )    NM          (163 				   )      (29 				   )    NM          Equity AFS securities:                                                                      Gross gains      2 				         1 				     100% 				         2 				         1 				     100% 				         Gross losses      (1 				   )         -        NM          (1 				   )         -        NM          Gain (loss) on other investments      (3 				   )         -        NM          (63 				   )      (8 				   )    NM          Associated amortization of DAC, VOBA,                                                                      DSI and DFEL and changes in                                                                       other contract holder funds      (5 				   )      (10 				   )  50% 				         (8 				   )      (15 				   )  47% 				         Total realized gain (loss) related to                                                                       certain investments, pre-tax    $  (65 				   )    $  (1 				   )    NM        $  (172 				   )    $  (28 				   )    NM         ﻿     (1)    These amounts are represented net of related fair value hedging activity. See Note 5 for more information.  ﻿   Amortization of DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL and changes in other contract holder funds reflect an assumption for an expected level of credit-related investment losses.  When actual credit-related investment losses are realized, we recognize a true-up to our DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL amortization and changes in other contract holder funds within realized losses reflecting the incremental effect of actual      87         versus expected credit-related investment losses. These actual to expected amortization adjustments could create volatility in net realized gains and losses. The write-down for impairments includes both credit-related and interest rate-related impairments.   Realized gains and losses generally originate from asset sales to reposition the portfolio or to respond to product experience. During the first six months of 2016 and 2015, we sold securities for gains and losses.  In the process of evaluating whether a security with an unrealized loss reflects declines that are other-than-temporary, we consider our ability and intent to sell the security prior to a recovery of value. However, subsequent decisions on securities sales are made within the context of overall risk monitoring, assessing value relative to other comparable securities and overall portfolio maintenance. Although our portfolio managers may, at a given point in time, believe that the preferred course of action is to hold securities with unrealized losses that are considered temporary until such losses are recovered, the dynamic nature of portfolio management may result in a subsequent decision to sell. These subsequent decisions are consistent with the classification of our investment portfolio as AFS. We expect to continue to manage all non-trading invested assets within our portfolios in a manner that is consistent with the AFS classification.    ﻿   We consider economic factors and circumstances within countries and industries where recent write-downs have occurred in our assessment of the status of securities we own of similarly situated issuers. While it is possible for realized or unrealized losses on a particular investment to affect other investments, our risk management strategy has been designed to identify correlation risks and other risks inherent in managing an investment portfolio. Once identified, strategies and procedures are developed to effectively monitor and manage these risks. The areas of risk correlation that we pay particular attention to are risks that may be correlated within specific financial and business markets, risks within specific industries and risks associated with related parties.   ﻿   When the detailed analysis by our external asset managers and investment portfolio managers leads us to the conclusion that a security’s decline in fair value is other-than-temporary, the security is written down to estimated recovery value. In instances where declines are considered temporary, the security will continue to be carefully monitored. See “Part II – Item 7.

The increase in write-downs for OTTI when comparing the first six months of 2016 to the corresponding period in 2015 was primarily attributable to certain corporate bond holdings within the energy and other commodity sectors that experienced deteriorating fundamentals. The noncredit-related impairments were due to declines in values of securities for which we do not have an intent to sell or it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the securities before recovery.   ﻿   ﻿       88            REVIEW OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION   ﻿   Liquidity and Capital Resources   ﻿   Sources of Liquidity and Cash Flow   ﻿   ﻿   Liquidity refers to the ability of an enterprise to generate adequate amounts of cash from its normal operations to meet cash requirements with a prudent margin of safety. Our principal sources of cash flow from operating activities are insurance premiums and fees and investment income, while sources of cash flows from investing activities result from maturities and sales of invested assets. Our operating activities provided cash of $533 million and $582 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. When considering our liquidity and cash flow, it is important to distinguish between the needs of our insurance subsidiaries and the needs of the holding company, LNC. As a holding company with no operations of its own, LNC derives its cash primarily from its operating subsidiaries.    ﻿   The sources of liquidity of the holding company are principally comprised of dividends and interest payments from subsidiaries, augmented by holding company short-term investments, bank lines of credit and the ongoing availability of long-term public financing under an SEC-filed shelf registration statement. These sources of liquidity and cash flow support the general corporate needs of the holding company, including its common stock dividends, interest and debt service, funding of callable securities, securities repurchases, acquisitions and investment in core businesses.    ﻿   Details underlying the primary sources of our holding company cash flows (in millions) were as follows:   ﻿      ﻿                                                                      ﻿                                                                      ﻿    For the Three                For the Six                  ﻿    Months Ended                Months Ended                  ﻿    June 30,                June 30,                  ﻿    2016        2015        Change        2016        2015        Change          Dividends from Subsidiaries                                                                      The Lincoln National Life Insurance                                                                      Company    $  325 				       $  225 				     44% 				       $  525 				       $  625 				       -16%          ﻿                                                                      Loan Repayments and Interest from                                                                      Subsidiaries                                                                      Interest on inter-company notes      28 				         26 				     8% 				         58 				         56 				     4% 				         ﻿    $  353 				       $  251 				     41% 				       $  583 				       $  681 				       -14%          Other Cash Flow and Liquidity Items                                                                      Net capital received from (paid for taxes on)                                                                      stock option exercises and restricted stock    $     -        $  16 				       -100%        $  (11 				   )    $  25 				       NM         ﻿   The table above focuses on significant and recurring cash flow items and excludes the effects of certain financing activities, namely the periodic issuance and retirement of debt and cash flows related to our inter-company cash management program (discussed below). Taxes have been eliminated from the analysis due to a tax sharing agreement among our primary subsidiaries resulting in a modest effect on net cash flows at the holding company. Also excluded from this analysis is the modest amount of investment income on short-term investments of the holding company. For information regarding limits on the dividends that our insurance subsidiaries may pay, see “Part II – Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Review of Consolidated Financial Condition – Liquidity and Capital Resources – Restrictions on Dividends from Subsidiaries” in our 2015 Form 10-K.    ﻿   Insurance Subsidiaries’ Statutory Capital and Surplus   ﻿   Our regulatory capital levels are also affected by statutory accounting rules, which are subject to change by each applicable insurance regulator. Our term products and UL products containing secondary guarantees require reserves calculated pursuant to XXX and AG38, respectively. During the third quarter of 2013, the New York State Department of Financial Services announced that it would not recognize the NAIC revisions to AG38 in applying the New York law governing the reserves to be held for UL and VUL products containing secondary guarantees. The change, which was effective as of December 31, 2013, impacted the Lincoln Life & Annuity Company of New York (“LLANY”). Although LLANY discontinued the sale of these products in early 2013, the change affected those policies previously sold. We began phasing in the increase in reserves in 2013 at $90 million per year over five years. As of June 30, 2016, we have increased reserves by $270 million. In April 2016, LLANY entered into a third-party reinsurance arrangement primarily covering UL policies containing secondary guarantees issued between 2002 through 2014 that mitigates the financial impact of the increase of the aforementioned reserves.   ﻿   As discussed in “Part I – Item 1. Risk Factors – Legislative, Regulatory, and Tax – Attempts to mitigate the impact of Regulation XXX and Actuarial Guideline 38 may fail in whole or in part resulting in an adverse effect on our financial condition and result of operations,” our insurance subsidiaries employ strategies to reduce the strain caused by XXX and AG38 by reinsuring the business to insurance captives. Our captive reinsurance and reinsurance subsidiaries provide a mechanism for financing a portion of the excess reserve      89         amounts in a more efficient manner. We use long-dated LOCs and debt financing as well as other financing strategies to finance those reserves. Included in the LOCs issued as of June 30, 2016, was approximately $3.4 billion of long-dated LOCs issued to support inter-company reinsurance arrangements. Approximately $2.3 billion of such LOCs were issued to support reinsurance for UL products containing secondary guarantees ($350 million will expire in 2019, $1 million will expire in 2021 and $1.9 billion will expire in 2031), and $1.1 billion of such LOCs that will expire in 2023 were issued to support reinsurance for term business. We have also used the proceeds from senior note issuances of $875 million to execute long-term structured solutions supporting reinsurance of UL products containing secondary guarantees. Additionally, our captive reinsurance and reinsurance subsidiaries have issued long-term notes of $1.7 billion as of June 30, 2016, to finance a portion of the excess reserves. For information on these long-term notes issued by our captive reinsurance and reinsurance subsidiaries, see Note 4 in our 2015 Form 10-K. LOCs and related capital market solutions lower the capital effect of term products and UL products containing secondary guarantees.  An inability to obtain appropriate capital market solutions could affect our returns on our in-force term products and UL products containing secondary guarantees. However, we believe that we have sufficient capital to support the increase in statutory reserves, based on our current reserve projections, if such structures were no longer available.   ﻿   Our captive reinsurance subsidiaries free up capital the insurance subsidiaries can use for any number of purposes, including paying dividends to the holding company. Once transferred to the holding company, it can deploy this capital for a variety of corporate purposes, including potential stock repurchases. Actuarial Guideline 48 (“AG48”) regulates the terms of captive reinsurance arrangements that are entered into or amended in certain ways after December 31, 2014. AG48 imposes restrictions on the types of assets that can be used to support these arrangements. We have implemented and plan to continue to implement these arrangements in compliance with AG48.   ﻿   Statutory reserves established for variable annuity contracts and riders are sensitive to changes in the equity markets and are affected by the level of account values relative to the level of any guarantees, product design and reinsurance arrangements. As a result, the relationship between reserve changes and equity market performance is non-linear during any given reporting period. Market conditions greatly influence the ultimate capital required due to its effect on the valuation of reserves and derivative assets hedging these reserves. We also utilize inter-company reinsurance arrangements to manage our hedge program for variable annuity guarantees. The NAIC through its various committees, task forces and working groups has been studying the use of captives and special purpose vehicles to transfer insurance risk and has been evaluating the adequacy of existing NAIC model laws and regulations applicable to annuity captives.   ﻿   We continue to analyze the use of our existing captive reinsurance structures, as well as additional third-party reinsurance arrangements, and our current hedging strategies relative to managing the effects of equity markets and interest rates on the statutory reserves, statutory capital and the dividend capacity of our life insurance subsidiaries.   ﻿   Financing Activities   ﻿   Although our subsidiaries currently generate adequate cash flow to meet the needs of our normal operations, periodically we may issue debt or equity securities to maintain ratings and increase liquidity, as well as to fund internal growth, acquisitions and the retirement of our debt and equity securities.    ﻿   We currently have an effective shelf registration statement, which allows us to issue, in unlimited amounts, securities, including debt securities, preferred stock, common stock, warrants, stock purchase contracts, stock purchase units and depository shares.    ﻿   Details underlying debt and financing activities (in millions) for the six months ended June 30, 2016, were as follows:   ﻿      ﻿                                                                                          ﻿          ﻿                                Maturities,        Change                                      ﻿                                Repayments        in Fair                                      ﻿    Beginning                         and         Value            Other            Ending      ﻿    Balance        Issuance        Refinancing        Hedges        Changes (1)        Balance      Short-Term Debt                                                                                          Current maturities of long-term debt (2)    $     -        $     -            $     -            $     -            $  250 				           $  250 				     ﻿                                                                                          Long-Term Debt                                                                                          Senior notes    $  3,846 				       $     -            $     -            $  154 				           $  3 				           $  4,003 				     Bank borrowing       250 				            -                 -                 -                 -              250 				     Federal Home Loan Bank of                                                                                          Indianapolis note      250 				            -                 -                 -              (250 				   )             -      Capital securities       1,207 				            -                 -                 -                 -              1,207 				     Total long-term debt    $  5,553 				       $     -            $     -            $  154 				           $  (247 				   )        $  5,460 				    ﻿     (1)    Includes the net increase (decrease) in commercial paper, non-cash reclassification of long-term debt to current maturities of long-term debt, accretion (amortization) of discounts and premiums and amortization of debt issuance costs, as applicable.    (2)    As of June 30, 2016, our primary insurance subsidiary, The Lincoln National Life Insurance Company, had short-term debt that consisted of a $250 million floating rate note maturing on June 20, 2017.  ﻿       90         As of June 30, 2016, the holding company had available liquidity of $523 million. Available liquidity consists of cash and invested cash, excluding cash held as collateral, and certain short-term investments that can be readily converted into cash, net of commercial paper outstanding.    ﻿   Effective as of June 30, 2016, we entered into a credit agreement with a syndicate of banks. This agreement (the “credit facility”) allows for the issuance of LOCs of up to $2.5 billion and borrowing of up to $2.5 billion, $1.75 billion of which is available only to reimburse the banks for drawn LOCs. The credit facility is unsecured and has a commitment termination date of June 30, 2021. LOCs under the facility are used primarily to satisfy reserve credit requirements of (i) our domestic insurance companies for which reserve credit is provided by our affiliated reinsurance companies and (ii) certain ceding companies of our legacy reinsurance business.   ﻿   The credit facility contains or includes:   ﻿     ·    Customary terms and conditions, including covenants restricting our ability to incur liens, merge or consolidate with another entity where we are not the surviving entity and dispose of all or substantially all of our assets;    ·    Financial covenants including maintenance of a minimum consolidated net worth (as defined in the facility) equal to the sum of $10.5 billion plus 50% of the aggregate net proceeds of equity issuances received by us in accordance with the terms of the credit facility; and a debt-to-capital ratio as defined in accordance with the credit facility not to exceed 0.35 to 1.00; and     ·    Customary events of default, subject to certain materiality thresholds and grace periods for certain of those events of default.  ﻿   Upon an event of default, the credit facility provides that, among other things, the commitments may be terminated and the loans then outstanding may be declared due and payable. As of June 30, 2016, we were in compliance with all such covenants.   ﻿   For more information about our short-term and long-term debt and our credit facilities and LOCs, see Note 12 in our 2015 Form 10-K.   ﻿   We have not accounted for repurchase agreements, securities lending transactions, or other transactions involving the transfer of financial assets with an obligation to repurchase the transferred assets as sales. For information about our collateralized financing transactions on our investments, see “Payables for Collateral on Investments” in Note 4.   ﻿   If current credit ratings and claims-paying ratings were downgraded in the future, terms in our derivative agreements may be triggered, which could negatively affect overall liquidity. For the majority of our counterparties, there is a termination event should the long-term senior debt ratings of LNC drop below BBB-/Baa3 (S&P/Moody’s). Our long-term senior debt held a rating of A-/Baa1 (S&P/Moody’s) as of June 30, 2016. In addition, contractual selling agreements with intermediaries could be negatively affected, which could have an adverse effect on overall sales of annuities, life insurance and investment products. See “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors – Liquidity and Capital Position – A decrease in the capital and surplus of our insurance subsidiaries may result in a downgrade to our credit and insurer financial strength ratings” and “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors – Covenants and Ratings – A downgrade in our financial strength or credit ratings could limit our ability to market products, increase the number or value of policies being surrendered and/or hurt our relationships with creditors” in our 2015 Form 10-K for more information. See “Part I – Item 1. Business – Financial Strength Ratings” in our 2015 Form 10-K for additional information on our current financial strength ratings.   ﻿   See “Part II – Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Review of Consolidated Financial Condition – Liquidity and Capital Resources – Financing Activities” in our 2015 Form 10-K for information on our credit ratings.   ﻿   Alternative Sources of Liquidity   ﻿   In order to manage our capital more efficiently, we have an inter-company cash management program where certain subsidiaries can lend to or borrow from the holding company to meet short-term borrowing needs. The cash management program is essentially a series of demand loans between LNC and participating subsidiaries that reduces overall borrowing costs by allowing LNC and its subsidiaries to access internal resources instead of incurring third-party transaction costs. As of June 30, 2016, the holding company had a net outstanding payable of $286 million to certain subsidiaries resulting from loans made by subsidiaries in excess of amounts borrowed by subsidiaries in the inter-company cash management account. Any change in holding company cash management program balances is offset by the immediate and equal change in holding company cash and invested cash. Loans under the cash management program are permitted under applicable insurance laws subject to certain restrictions. For our Indiana-domiciled insurance subsidiaries, the borrowing and lending limit is currently 3% of the insurance company’s admitted assets as of its most recent year end. For our New York-domiciled insurance subsidiary, it may borrow from LNC less than 2% of its admitted assets as of the last year end but may not lend any amounts to LNC.   ﻿   Our insurance subsidiaries, by virtue of their general account fixed-income investment holdings, can access liquidity through securities lending programs and repurchase agreements. As of June 30, 2016, our insurance subsidiaries had investments with a carrying value of $3.3 billion out on loan or subject to repurchase agreements. The cash received in our securities lending programs and repurchase agreements is typically invested in cash equivalents, short-term investments or fixed maturity securities. For additional details, see “Payables for Collateral on Investments” in Note 4.   ﻿       91            Cash Flows from Collateral on Derivatives   ﻿   Our cash flows associated with collateral received from and posted with counterparties change as the market value of the underlying derivative contract changes. As the value of a derivative asset decreases (or increases), the collateral required to be posted by our counterparties would also decrease (or increase). Likewise, when the value of a derivative liability decreases (or increases), the collateral we are required to post to our counterparties would also decrease (or increase). During the six months ended June 30, 2016, our payables for collateral on derivative investments increased by $1.6 billion due primarily to decreasing interest rates that increased the fair values of our associated derivative investments. In the event of adverse changes in fair value of our derivative instruments, we may need to post collateral with a counterparty if our net derivative liability position reaches certain contractual levels. If we do not have sufficient high quality securities or cash and invested cash to provide as collateral, we have multiple liquidity sources to leverage that would be eligible for collateral posting. For additional information, see “Credit Risk” in Note 5.   ﻿   Divestitures   ﻿   For a discussion of our divestitures, see Note 3 in our 2015 Form 10-K.   ﻿   Uses of Capital   ﻿   Our principal uses of cash are to pay policy claims and benefits, operating expenses, commissions and taxes, to purchase new investments, to purchase reinsurance, to fund policy surrenders and withdrawals, to pay dividends to our stockholders, to repurchase our stock and to repay debt.    ﻿   Return of Capital to Common Stockholders    ﻿   One of the Company’s primary goals is to provide a return to our common stockholders through share price accretion, dividends and stock repurchases. In determining dividends, the Board of Directors takes into consideration items such as current and expected earnings, capital needs, rating agency considerations and requirements for financial flexibility. The amount and timing of share repurchase depends on key capital ratios, rating agency expectations, the generation of free cash flow and an evaluation of the costs and benefits associated with alternative uses of capital. Free cash flow for the holding company generally represents the amount of dividends and interest received from subsidiaries less interest paid on debt.   ﻿   Details underlying this activity (in millions, except per share data), were as follows:   ﻿      ﻿                                                                      ﻿                                                                      ﻿    For the Three                For the Six                  ﻿    Months Ended                Months Ended                  ﻿    June 30,                June 30,                  ﻿    2016        2015        Change        2016        2015        Change          Common dividends to stockholders    $  60 				       $  51 				     18% 				       $  121 				       $  102 				     19% 				         Repurchase of common stock      275 				         150 				     83% 				         475 				         500 				       -5%          Total cash returned to stockholders    $  335 				       $  201 				     67% 				       $  596 				       $  602 				       -1%          ﻿                                                                      Number of shares repurchased      6.243 				         2.559 				     144% 				         11.759 				         8.602 				     37% 				         Average price per share    $  44.07 				       $  58.64 				       -25%        $  40.41 				       $  58.15 				       -31%         ﻿   On October 28, 2015, our Board of Directors approved an increase of the quarterly dividend on our common stock from $0.20 to $0.25 per share. Additionally, we expect to repurchase additional shares of common stock during 2016 depending on market conditions and alternative uses of capital.

Taxes have been eliminated from the      92         analysis due to a tax sharing agreement among our primary subsidiaries resulting in a modest effect on net cash flows at the holding company.   ﻿   Significant Trends in Sources and Uses of Cash Flow   ﻿   As stated above, LNC’s cash flow, as a holding company, is largely dependent upon the dividend capacity of its insurance company subsidiaries as well as their ability to advance funds to it through inter-company borrowing arrangements, which may be affected by factors influencing the insurance subsidiaries’ RBC and statutory earnings performance. We currently expect to be able to meet the holding company’s ongoing cash needs and to have sufficient capital to offer downside protection in the event that the capital and credit markets experience another period of extreme volatility and disruption. A decline in capital market conditions, which reduces our insurance subsidiaries’ statutory surplus and RBC, may require them to retain more capital and may pressure our subsidiaries’ dividends to the holding company, which may lead us to take steps to preserve or raise additional capital. For factors that could affect our expectations for liquidity and capital, see “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2015 Form 10-K as updated by “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our first quarter 2016 Form 10-Q.   ﻿   For factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in this section, see “Forward-Looking Statements – Cautionary Language” above and “Part I – Item 1A.

Some of the changes include initiatives to require more reserves to be carried by our insurance subsidiaries. Although the eventual effect on us of the changing environment in which we operate remains uncertain, these factors and others could have a material effect on our results of operations, liquidity and capital resources. For factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in this section, see “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2015 Form 10-K as updated by “Item 1A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk    ﻿   We analyze and manage the risks arising from market exposures of financial instruments, as well as other risks, in an integrated asset-liability management process that considers diversification. By aggregating the potential effect of market and other risks on the entire enterprise, we estimate, review and in some cases manage the risk to our earnings and shareholder value. We have exposures to several market risks including interest rate risk, equity market risk, default risk, credit risk and, to a lesser extent, foreign currency exchange risk. The exposures of financial instruments to market risks, and the related risk management processes, are most important to our business where most of the invested assets support accumulation and investment-oriented insurance products. As an important element of our integrated asset-liability management processes, we use derivatives to minimize the effects of changes in interest levels, the shape of the yield curve, currency movements and volatility. In this context, derivatives serve to minimize interest rate risk by mitigating the effect of significant increases in interest rates on our earnings. Additional market exposures exist in our other general account insurance products and in our debt structure and derivatives positions. Our primary sources of market risk are substantial, relatively rapid and sustained increases or decreases in interest rates or a sharp drop in equity market values. These market risks are discussed in detail in the following pages and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements presented in “Item 1. Financial Statements,” as well as “Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”   ﻿   Interest Rate Risk     ﻿   Effect of Interest Rate Sensitivity   ﻿   For information about the effect of interest rate sensitivity on our income (loss) from operations, see “Part II – Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – Interest Rate Risk – Effect of Interest Rate Sensitivity” in our 2015 Form 10-K.   ﻿   Interest Rate Risk on Fixed Insurance Businesses    ﻿   In periods of low interest rates, we have to reinvest the cash we receive as interest or return of principal on our investments in lower yielding instruments. Moreover, borrowers may prepay fixed-income securities, commercial mortgages and mortgage-backed securities in our general accounts in order to borrow at lower market rates, which exacerbates this risk. Because we are entitled to reset the interest rates on our fixed-rate annuities only at limited, pre-established intervals, and because many of our contracts have guaranteed minimum interest or crediting rates, our spreads could decrease and potentially become negative.        93         ﻿   Prolonged historically low rates are not healthy for our business fundamentals. However, we have recognized this risk and have been proactive in our investment strategies, product designs, crediting rate strategies and overall asset-liability practices to mitigate the risk of unfavorable consequences in this type of environment. For some time now, new products have been sold with low minimum crediting floors, and we apply disciplined asset-liability management standards, such as locking in spreads on these products at the time of issue. See “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors – Market Conditions – Changes in interest rates and sustained low interest rates may cause interest rate spreads to decrease and changes in interest rates may also result in increased contract withdrawals” in our 2015 Form 10-K for additional information on interest rate risks.   ﻿   The following provides detail on the percentage differences between the June 30, 2016, interest rates being credited to contract holders based on the second quarter of 2016 declared rates and the respective minimum guaranteed policy rate (in millions), broken out by contract holder account values reported within our segments:   ﻿   ﻿      ﻿                                                                          ﻿                                                                          ﻿    Account Values          ﻿                Retirement                                %           ﻿                    Plan            Life                         Account          ﻿    Annuities            Services        Insurance (1)        Total        Values          Excess of Crediting Rates over Contract Minimums                                                                          Discretionary rate setting products: (2)                                                                          Occurring within the next twelve months: (3)                                                                          No difference    $  8,502 				           $  11,258 				           $  32,384 				           $  52,144 				     71.0% 				         Up to 0.50%      1,658 				             693 				             454 				             2,805 				     3.8% 				         0.51% to 1.00%      3,226 				             642 				                -               3,868 				     5.3% 				         1.01% to 1.50%      2,507 				                -               122 				             2,629 				     3.6% 				         1.51% to 2.00%      428 				                -               868 				             1,296 				     1.8% 				         2.01% to 2.50%      132 				                -                  -               132 				     0.2% 				         2.51% to 3.00%      137 				                -                  -               137 				     0.2% 				         3.01% or greater      43 				                -                  -               43 				     0.1% 				         Occurring after the next twelve months (4)      3,562 				                -                  -               3,562 				     4.9% 				         Total discretionary rate setting products       20,195 				             12,593 				             33,828 				             66,616 				     90.9% 				         Other contracts (5)      2,296 				             4,403 				                -               6,699 				     9.1% 				         Total account values    $  22,491 				           $  16,996 				           $  33,828 				           $  73,315 				     100.0% 				         ﻿                                                                          Percentage of discretionary rate setting product account                                                                          values at minimum guaranteed rates      42.1% 				             89.4% 				             95.7% 				             78.3% 				                ﻿     (1)    Excludes policy loans.

(3)    The average crediting rates were 46 basis points, 5 basis points and 6 basis points in excess of average minimum guaranteed rates for our Annuities, Retirement Plan Services and Life Insurance segments, respectively.    (4)    The average crediting rates were 103 basis points in excess of average minimum guaranteed rates. Of our account values for these products: 27% are scheduled to reset in more than one year but not more than two years; 22% are scheduled to reset in more than two years but not more than three years; and 51% are scheduled to reset in more than three years.     (5)    For Annuities, this amount relates primarily to income annuity and short-term dollar cost averaging business. For Retirement Plan Services, this amount relates primarily to indexed-based rate setting products in which the average crediting rates were 15 basis points in excess of average minimum guaranteed rates and 75% of account values were already at their minimum guaranteed rates.  ﻿   The maturity structure and call provisions of the related portfolios are structured to afford protection against erosion of investment portfolio yields during periods of declining interest rates. We devote extensive effort to evaluating the risks associated with falling interest rates by simulating asset and liability cash flows for a wide range of interest rate scenarios. We seek to manage these exposures by maintaining a suitable maturity structure and by limiting our exposure to call risk in each respective investment portfolio.   ﻿   Derivatives   ﻿   See Note 5 for information on our derivatives used to hedge our exposure to changes in interest rates.   ﻿   Equity Market Risk   ﻿   Our revenues, assets and liabilities are exposed to equity market risk that we often hedge with derivatives. Due to the use of our RTM process and our hedging strategies, we expect that, in general, short-term fluctuations in the equity markets should not have a significant effect on our quarterly earnings from unlocking of assumptions for DAC, VOBA, DSI, and DFEL. However, earnings are affected by equity market movements on account values and assets under management and the related fees we earn on those assets. Refer to “Part II      94         – Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Introduction – Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL” in our 2015 Form 10-K for further discussion of the effects of equity markets on our RTM.    ﻿   Effect of Equity Market Sensitivity   ﻿   For information about the effect of equity market sensitivity on our income (loss) from operations, see “Part II – Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – Equity Market Risk – Effect of Equity Market Sensitivity” in our 2015 Form 10-K.   ﻿   Credit Risk   ﻿   We may use credit-related derivatives to minimize our exposure to credit-related events, and we also sell credit default swaps to offer credit protection to our contract holders and investors.    ﻿   In addition to the information provided about our counterparty exposure in Note 5, the fair value of our exposure by rating (in millions) was as follows:   ﻿   ﻿      ﻿                                          ﻿        As of            As of              ﻿    June 30,    December 31,          ﻿        2016            2015              A        $  5 				           $  5 				             BBB          10 				             10 				             Total         $  15 				           $  15 				            ﻿   See Note 5 for additional information on our credit risk.    ﻿   Item 4. Controls and Procedures   ﻿   Conclusions Regarding Disclosure Controls and Procedures    ﻿   We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, which are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  As of the end of the period required by this report, we, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting them to material information relating to us and our consolidated subsidiaries required to be disclosed in our periodic reports under the Exchange Act.   ﻿   Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting    ﻿   There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended June 30, 2016, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.    ﻿   A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the company have been detected. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.    ﻿   ﻿       95         PART II – OTHER INFORMATION   ﻿   Item 1.
