Item 1A. Risk Factors,” “Part II – Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and “Part II – Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data”; and our current reports on Form 8-K filed in 2016. For more detailed information on the risks and uncertainties associated with the Company’s business activities, see the risks described in “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2015 Form 10-K as updated by “Item 1A. Risk Factors” below.   ﻿   In this report, in addition to providing consolidated revenues and net income (loss), we also provide segment operating revenues and income (loss) from operations because we believe they are meaningful measures of revenues and the profitability of our operating segments. Financial information that follows is presented in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”), unless otherwise indicated. See Note 1 in our 2015 Form 10-K for a discussion of GAAP.   ﻿   Operating revenues and income (loss) from operations are the financial performance measures we use to evaluate and assess the results of our segments. Accordingly, we define and report operating revenues and income (loss) from operations by segment in Note 13. Our management believes that operating revenues and income (loss) from operations explain the results of our ongoing businesses in a manner that allows for a better understanding of the underlying trends in our current businesses because the excluded items are unpredictable and not necessarily indicative of current operating fundamentals or future performance of the business segments, and, in many instances, decisions regarding these items do not necessarily relate to the operations of the individual segments. In addition, we believe that our definitions of operating revenues and income (loss) from operations will provide investors with a more valuable measure of our performance because it better reveals trends in our business.    ﻿   FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS – CAUTIONARY LANGUAGE   ﻿   Certain statements made in this report and in other written or oral statements made by us or on our behalf are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (“PSLRA”). A forward-looking statement is a statement that is not a historical fact and, without limitation, includes any statement that may predict, forecast, indicate or imply future results, performance or achievements, and may contain words like: “believe,” “anticipate,” “expect,” “estimate,” “project,” “will,” “shall” and other words or phrases with similar meaning in connection with a discussion of future operating or financial performance. In particular, these include statements relating to future actions, trends in our businesses, prospective services or products, future performance or financial results and the outcome of contingencies, such as legal proceedings. We claim the protection afforded by the safe harbor for forward-looking statements provided by the PSLRA.    ﻿   Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from the results contained in the forward-looking statements. Risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to vary materially, some of which are described within the forward-looking statements, include, among others:    ﻿     ·    Deterioration in general economic and business conditions that may affect account values, investment results, guaranteed benefit liabilities, premium levels, claims experience and the level of pension benefit costs, funding and investment results;     ·    Adverse global capital and credit market conditions could affect our ability to raise capital, if necessary, and may cause us to realize impairments on investments and certain intangible assets, including goodwill and the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets, which may reduce future earnings and/or affect our financial condition and ability to raise additional capital or refinance existing debt as it matures;     ·    Because of our holding company structure, the inability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends to the holding company in sufficient amounts could harm the holding company’s ability to meet its obligations;    ·    Legislative, regulatory or tax changes, both domestic and foreign, that affect: the cost of, or demand for, our subsidiaries’ products, the required amount of reserves and/or surplus, our ability to conduct business and our captive reinsurance arrangements as well as restrictions on revenue sharing and 12b‑1 payments, the potential for U.S. federal tax reform and the impact of the Department of Labor’s (“DOL”) regulation defining fiduciary;    ·    Actions taken by reinsurers to raise rates on in-force business;     ·    Declines in or sustained low interest rates causing a reduction in investment income, the interest margins of our businesses, estimated gross profits (“EGPs”) and demand for our products;     ·    Rapidly increasing interest rates causing contract holders to surrender life insurance and annuity policies, thereby causing realized investment losses, and reduced hedge performance related to variable annuities;    ·    Uncertainty about the effect of rules and regulations to be promulgated under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank Act”) on us and the economy and financial services sector in particular;    ·    The initiation of legal or regulatory proceedings against us, and the outcome of any legal or regulatory proceedings, such as: adverse actions related to present or past business practices common in businesses in which we compete; adverse decisions in significant      43         actions including, but not limited to, actions brought by federal and state authorities and class action cases; new decisions that result in changes in law; and unexpected trial court rulings;    ·    A decline in the equity markets causing a reduction in the sales of our subsidiaries’ products, a reduction of asset-based fees that our subsidiaries charge on various investment and insurance products, an acceleration of the net amortization of deferred acquisition costs (“DAC”), value of business acquired (“VOBA”), deferred sales inducements (“DSI”) and deferred front-end loads (“DFEL”) and an increase in liabilities related to guaranteed benefit features of our subsidiaries’ variable annuity products;    ·    Ineffectiveness of our risk management policies and procedures, including various hedging strategies used to offset the effect of changes in the value of liabilities due to changes in the level and volatility of the equity markets and interest rates;    ·    A deviation in actual experience regarding future persistency, mortality, morbidity, interest rates or equity market returns from the assumptions used in pricing our subsidiaries’ products, in establishing related insurance reserves and in the net amortization of DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL, which may reduce future earnings;     ·    Changes in GAAP, including convergence with International Financial Reporting Standards, that may result in unanticipated changes to our net income;    ·    Lowering of one or more of our debt ratings issued by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations and the adverse effect such action may have on our ability to raise capital and on our liquidity and financial condition;    ·    Lowering of one or more of the insurer financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries and the adverse effect such action may have on the premium writings, policy retention, profitability of our insurance subsidiaries and liquidity;    ·    Significant credit, accounting, fraud, corporate governance or other issues that may adversely affect the value of certain investments in our portfolios, as well as counterparties to which we are exposed to credit risk, requiring that we realize losses on investments;    ·    Inability to protect our intellectual property rights or claims of infringement of the intellectual property rights of others;    ·    Interruption in telecommunication, information technology or other operational systems or failure to safeguard the confidentiality or privacy of sensitive data on such systems from cyberattacks or other breaches of our data security systems;    ·    The effect of acquisitions and divestitures, restructurings, product withdrawals and other unusual items;    ·    The adequacy and collectability of reinsurance that we have purchased;    ·    Acts of terrorism, a pandemic, war or other man-made and natural catastrophes that may adversely affect our businesses and the cost and availability of reinsurance;    ·    Competitive conditions, including pricing pressures, new product offerings and the emergence of new competitors, that may affect the level of premiums and fees that our subsidiaries can charge for their products;    ·    The unknown effect on our subsidiaries’ businesses resulting from changes in the demographics of their client base, as aging baby-boomers move from the asset-accumulation stage to the asset-distribution stage of life; and    ·    Loss of key management, financial planners or wholesalers.  ﻿   The risks included here are not exhaustive. Our annual report on Form 10-K, current reports on Form 8-K and other documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) include additional factors that could affect our businesses and financial performance. Moreover, we operate in a rapidly changing and competitive environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors.    ﻿   Further, it is not possible to assess the effect of all risk factors on our businesses or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results. In addition, we disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that occur after the date of this report.    ﻿   INTRODUCTION   ﻿   Executive Summary    ﻿   We are a holding company that operates multiple insurance and retirement businesses through subsidiary companies. Through our business segments, we sell a wide range of wealth protection, accumulation and retirement income products and solutions. These products include fixed and indexed annuities, variable annuities, universal life insurance (“UL”), variable universal life insurance (“VUL”), linked-benefit UL, indexed universal life insurance (“IUL”), term life insurance, employer-sponsored retirement plans and services, and group life, disability and dental.   ﻿   We provide products and services and report results through our Annuities, Retirement Plan Services, Life Insurance and Group Protection segments. We also have Other Operations. These segments and Other Operations are described in “Part I – Item 1. Business” of our 2015 Form 10-K.    ﻿   For information on how we derive our revenues, see the discussion in results of operations by segment below.   ﻿   Our current market conditions, significant operational matters, industry trends, issues and outlook are described in “Part II – Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Introduction – Executive Summary” of our 2015 Form 10-K.    ﻿   For factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in this section, see “Forward-Looking Statements – Cautionary Language” above and “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2015 Form 10-K as updated by “Item 1A. Risk Factors” below.    ﻿       44         Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates   ﻿   The MD&A included in our 2015 Form 10-K contains a detailed discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates. The following information updates the “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” provided in our 2015 Form 10-K and, accordingly, should be read in conjunction with the “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” discussed in our 2015 Form 10-K.   ﻿   DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL   ﻿   Reversion to the Mean   ﻿   As variable fund returns do not move in a systematic manner, we reset the baseline of account values from which EGPs are projected, which we refer to as our reversion to the mean (“RTM”) process, as discussed in our 2015 Form 10-K.    ﻿   If we had unlocked our RTM assumption as of March 31, 2016, we would have recorded a favorable unlocking of approximately $115 million, pre-tax, for Annuities, approximately $20 million, pre-tax, for Retirement Plan Services, and approximately $15 million, pre-tax, for Life Insurance.   ﻿   Investments   ﻿   Investment Valuation    ﻿   The following summarizes our available-for-sale (“AFS”) and trading securities and derivative investments carried at fair value by pricing source and fair value hierarchy level (in millions) as of March 31, 2016:   ﻿      ﻿                                                                      ﻿                                                                      ﻿    Quoted                                                      ﻿    Prices                                                      ﻿    in Active                                                      ﻿    Markets for    Significant    Significant                      ﻿    Identical    Observable    Unobservable                      ﻿    Assets    Inputs    Inputs        Total          ﻿    (Level 1)    (Level 2)    (Level 3)        Fair Value          Priced by third-party pricing services        $  806 				           $  75,642 				           $     -            $  76,448 				         Priced by independent broker quotations             -                 -              1,801 				             1,801 				         Priced by matrices             -              12,880 				                -              12,880 				         Priced by other methods (1)             -                 -              1,665 				             1,665 				         Total        $  806 				           $  88,522 				           $  3,466 				           $  92,794 				         ﻿                                                                      Percent of total          1% 				             95% 				             4% 				             100% 				        ﻿     (1)    Represents primarily securities for which pricing models were used to compute fair value.   ﻿   ﻿   For more information about the valuation of our financial instruments carried at fair value, see “Part II – Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Introduction – Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Investments – Investment Valuation” in our 2015 Form 10-K and Note 12 herein.   ﻿   As of March 31, 2016, we evaluated the markets that our securities trade in and concluded that none were inactive. We will continue to re-evaluate this conclusion, as needed, based on market conditions. We use unobservable inputs to measure the fair value of securities trading in less liquid or illiquid markets with limited or no pricing information. We obtain broker quotes for securities such as synthetic convertibles, index-linked certificates of deposit and collateralized debt obligations (“CDOs”) when sufficient security structure or other market information is not available to produce an evaluation. For broker-quoted only securities, non-binding quotes from market makers or broker-dealers are obtained from sources recognized as market participants. Broker-quoted securities are based solely on receipt of updated quotes from a single market maker or a broker-dealer recognized as a market participant. Our broker-quoted only securities are generally classified as Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. As of March 31, 2016, we used broker quotes for 74 securities as our final price source, representing 1% of total securities owned.    ﻿   Derivatives    ﻿   Our accounting policies for derivatives and the potential effect on interest spreads in a falling rate environment are discussed in Note 5 of this report and “Part II – Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” in our 2015 Form 10-K.   ﻿   Guaranteed Living Benefits   ﻿   Within our individual annuity business, approximately 67% of our variable annuity account values contained guaranteed living benefits (“GLB”) features as of March 31, 2016. Underperforming equity markets increase our exposure to potential benefits with the GLB features. A contract with a GLB feature is “in the money” if the contract holder’s account balance falls below the present value of      45         guaranteed withdrawal or income benefits, assuming no lapses. As of March 31, 2016 and 2015, 11% and 3%, respectively, of all in-force contracts with a GLB feature were “in the money,” and our exposure, after reinsurance, as of March 31, 2016 and 2015, was $679 million and $254 million, respectively. However, the only way the contract holder can realize the excess of the present value of benefits over the account value of the contract is through a series of withdrawals or income payments that do not exceed a maximum amount. If, after the series of withdrawals or income payments, the account value is exhausted, the contract holder will continue to receive a series of annuity payments. The account value can also fluctuate with equity market returns on a daily basis resulting in increases or decreases in the excess of the present value of benefits over account value.   ﻿   For information on our variable annuity hedge program performance, see our discussion in “Realized Gain (Loss) and Benefit Ratio Unlocking – Variable Annuity Net Derivatives Results” below.    ﻿   For information on our estimates of the potential instantaneous effect to net income, which could result from sudden changes that may occur in equity markets, interest rates and implied market volatilities, see our discussion in “Part II – Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Introduction – Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Derivatives – GLB” in our 2015 Form 10-K.   ﻿

Comparison of the Three Months Ended March 31, 2016 to 2015   ﻿   Net income decreased due primarily to the following:    ﻿     ·    Unfavorable mortality in our Life Insurance segment.    ·    Higher legal expenses related to certain investments.     ·    Lower prepayment and bond make-whole premiums and less favorable investment income on alternative investments.    ·    An increase in other-than-temporary impairment (“OTTI”) attributable to individual credit risks within our corporate bond holdings.    ·    Decline in average account values due to lower average equity markets.    ·    Spread compression due to average new money rates trailing our current portfolio yields, partially offset by actions implemented to  reduce interest crediting rates.   ﻿   The decrease in net income was partially offset by the following:    ﻿     ·    Growth in business in force.    ·    More favorable total non-medical loss ratio experience in our Group Protection segment.  ﻿   RESULTS OF

(3)    Consists primarily of revenues attributable to broker-dealer services that are subject to market volatility.  ﻿   Comparison of the Three Months Ended March 31, 2016 to 2015   ﻿   Income from operations for this segment decreased due primarily to the following:   ﻿     ·    Lower fee income driven by lower average daily variable account values as a result of lower average equity markets.    ·    Higher benefits attributable to an increase in the growth in benefit reserves due to lower average equity markets.  ﻿   The decrease in income from operations was partially offset primarily by the following:   ﻿     ·    Lower commissions and other expenses driven by a decrease in amortization expense as a result of lower actual gross profits during 2016.    ·    Higher net investment income, net of interest credited, driven by higher average fixed account values as a result of positive net flows, partially offset by lower prepayments and bond make-whole premiums.       47         We provide information about this segment’s operating revenue and operating expense line items, the period in which amounts are recognized, key drivers of changes and historical details underlying the line items and their associated drivers below.    ﻿   See the Variable Account Value Information table within “Fee Income” below for drivers of changes in our variable account values and the Fixed Account Value Information table within “Net Investment Income and Interest Credited” below for drivers of changes in our fixed account values.    ﻿   Additional Information   ﻿   New deposits are an important component of net flows and key to our efforts to grow our business. Although deposits do not significantly affect current period income from operations, they are an important indicator of future profitability. For the three months ended March 31, 2016, 26% of our variable annuity deposits were on products without GLB riders, compared to 27% for the corresponding period in 2015. As a result of the more volatile market environment along with uncertainty surrounding the regulatory environment, our variable annuity deposits for the first quarter of 2016 were significantly lower than the corresponding period in 2015 resulting in negative net flows for the quarter.   ﻿   The other component of net flows relates to the retention of the business. An important measure of retention is the lapse rate, which compares the amount of withdrawals to the average account values. The overall lapse rate for our annuity products was 6% for the three months ended March 31, 2016, compared to 7% for the corresponding period in 2015.   ﻿   Our fixed annuity business includes products with discretionary crediting rates that are reset on an annual basis and are not subject to surrender charges. Our ability to retain annual reset annuities will be subject to current competitive conditions at the time interest rates for these products reset. We expect to manage the effects of spreads on near-term income from operations through portfolio management and, to a lesser extent, crediting rate actions, which assumes no significant changes in net flows into or out of our fixed accounts or other changes that may cause interest rate spreads to differ from our expectations.

New deposits are an important component of net flows and key to our efforts to grow our business. Although deposits do not significantly affect current period income from operations, they are an important indicator of future profitability. The other component of net flows relates to the retention of the business. An important measure of retention is the lapse rate, which compares the amount of withdrawals to the average account values. The overall lapse rate for the business was 13% for the three months ended March 31, 2016, compared to 12% for the corresponding period in 2015.    ﻿   Our net flows are negatively affected by the continued net outflows from our oldest blocks of annuities business (as presented on our Account Value Roll Forward table below as “Multi-Fund® and Other”), which are also our highest margin product lines in this segment, due to the fact that they are mature blocks with low distribution and servicing costs. The proportion of these products to our total account values was 30% and 31% as of March 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Due to this expected overall shift in business mix toward products with lower returns, a significant increase in new deposit production continues to be necessary to maintain earnings at current levels.    ﻿       52         Our fixed annuity business includes products with discretionary and index-based crediting rates that are reset on either a quarterly or semi-annual basis. Our ability to retain quarterly or semi-annual reset annuities will be subject to current competitive conditions at the time interest rates for these products reset. We expect to manage the effects of spreads on near-term income from operations through portfolio management and, to a lesser extent, crediting rate actions, which assumes no significant changes in net flows into or out of our fixed accounts or other changes that may cause interest rate spreads to differ from our expectations.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – Interest Rate Risk – Interest Rate Risk on Fixed Insurance Businesses – Falling Rates” and “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors – Market Conditions – Changes in interest rates and sustained low interest rates may cause interest rate spreads to decrease and changes in interest rates may also result in increased contract withdrawals” in our 2015 Form 10-K.   ﻿   On April 8, 2016, the DOL released the final fiduciary advice regulation that provides for a phased implementation, the first of which will be effective April 10, 2017, with full implementation by January 1, 2018.

Term products and UL products containing secondary guarantees require reserves calculated pursuant to the Valuation of Life Insurance Policies Model Regulation (“XXX”) and Actuarial Guideline 38 (“AG38”), respectively. For information on strategies we use to reduce the statutory reserve strain caused by XXX and AG38, see “Review of Consolidated Financial Condition – Sources of Liquidity and Cash Flow – Insurance Subsidiaries’ Statutory Capital and Surplus” below.       Additional Information   ﻿   During the first quarter of 2016, we experienced elevated mortality due primarily to claims seasonality and higher claims severity.   ﻿   For information on interest rate spreads and interest rate risk, see “Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – Interest Rate Risk” herein and “Part II – Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – Interest Rate Risk – Interest Rate Risk on Fixed Insurance Businesses – Falling Rates” and “Part I – Item 1A.

Generally, we have higher sales during the second half of the year with the fourth quarter being our strongest.    ﻿   Sales in the table above and as discussed above were reported as follows:   ﻿     ·    MoneyGuard®, our linked-benefit product – 15% of total expected premium deposits;    ·    UL, IUL and VUL – first year commissionable premiums plus 5% of excess premiums received, including an adjustment for internal replacements of approximately 50% of commissionable premiums;    ·    Executive Benefits – single premium bank-owned UL and VUL, 15% of single premium deposits, and corporate owned UL and VUL, first year commissionable premiums plus 5% of excess premium received, including an adjustment for internal replacements of approximately 50% of commissionable premiums; and    ·    Term – 100% of annualized first year premiums.  ﻿   We monitor the regulatory environment and make changes to our product offerings as needed to sustain the future profitability of our segment. We continue to focus on maintaining our diversified balance of life sales across all products, with an emphasis on products without long-term guarantees.

Statutory reserves will typically grow at a faster rate than account values because of the AG38 reserve requirements. Invested assets are based upon the statutory reserve liabilities and are affected by various reserve adjustments, including financing transactions providing relief from AG38 reserve requirements.  These financing transactions lead to a transfer of invested assets from this segment to Other Operations. We expect to earn a spread between what we earn on the underlying general account investments and what we credit to our contract holders’ accounts. We use our investment income to offset the earnings effect of the associated growth of our policy reserves for traditional products. Commercial mortgage loan prepayments and bond make-whole premiums and investment income on alternative investments can vary significantly from period to period due to a number of factors, and, therefore, may contribute to investment income results that are not indicative of the underlying trends.   ﻿       61            Benefits   ﻿   Details underlying benefits (dollars in millions) were as follows:   ﻿      ﻿                                      ﻿                                      ﻿    For the Three                  ﻿    Months Ended                  ﻿    March 31,                  ﻿    2016        2015        Change          Benefits                                      Death claims direct and assumed    $  1,091 				       $  1,001 				     9% 				         Death claims ceded      (449 				   )      (415 				   )    -8%          Reserves released on death      (147 				   )      (144 				   )    -2%          Net death benefits      495 				         442 				     12% 				         Change in secondary guarantee life                                      insurance product reserves      140 				         142 				       -1%          Change in linked-benefit product reserves      48 				         29 				     66% 				         Other benefits (1)      57 				         37 				     54% 				         Total benefits    $  740 				       $  650 				     14% 				         ﻿                                      Death claims per $1,000 of in-force      2.98 				         2.75 				     8% 				        ﻿     (1)    Includes primarily changes in reserves and dividends on traditional and other products.  ﻿   Benefits for this segment include claims incurred during the period in excess of the associated reserves for its interest-sensitive and traditional products.

These reserves are affected by changes in expected future trends of expense assessments and benefits causing unlocking adjustments to these liabilities similar to DAC, VOBA and DFEL.

Risk Factors” in our 2015 Form 10-K as updated by “Item 1A. Risk Factors” below.   ﻿   Net Investment Income and Interest Credited    ﻿   We utilize an internal formula to determine the amount of capital that is allocated to our business segments. Investment income on capital in excess of the calculated amounts is reported in Other Operations. If our business segments require increases in statutory reserves, surplus or investments, the amount of excess capital that is retained by Other Operations would decrease and net investment income would be negatively affected.   ﻿   Write-downs for OTTI decrease the recorded value of our invested assets owned by the business segments. These write-downs are not included in the income from operations of our business segments. When impairment occurs, assets are transferred to the business segments’ portfolios and will reduce the future net investment income for Other Operations. Statutory reserve adjustments for our business segments can also cause allocations of invested assets between the business segments and Other Operations.       The majority of our interest credited relates to our reinsurance operations sold to Swiss Re Life & Health America, Inc. (“Swiss Re”) in 2001. A substantial amount of the business was sold through indemnity reinsurance transactions, which is still recorded in our consolidated financial statements. The interest credited corresponds to investment income earnings on the assets we continue to hold for this business. There is no effect to income or loss in Other Operations or on a consolidated basis for these amounts because interest earned on the blocks that continue to be reinsured is passed through to Swiss Re in the form of interest credited.   ﻿       66              67            Benefits   ﻿   Benefits are recognized when incurred for institutional pension products and disability income business.   ﻿   Other Expenses   ﻿   ﻿   Details underlying other expenses (in millions) were as follows:   ﻿   ﻿      ﻿                                      ﻿                                      ﻿    For the Three                  ﻿    Months Ended                  ﻿    March 31,                  ﻿    2016        2015        Change          Other Expenses                                      General and administrative expenses:                                      Legal    $  1 				       $  2 				       -50%          Branding      7 				         5 				     40% 				         Other (1)      (8 				   )      7 				       NM          Total general and administrative                                      expenses         -          14 				       -100%          Taxes, licenses and fees      (6 				   )      (2 				   )    NM          Inter-segment reimbursement associated                                      with reserve financing and                                       LOC expenses (2)      (2 				   )      (3 				   )  33% 				         Total other expenses    $  (8 				   )    $  9 				       NM         ﻿     (1)    Includes expenses that are corporate in nature including charitable contributions, the portion of our deferred compensation plan expense attributable to participants’ selection of LNC stock as the measure for their investment return and other expenses not allocated to our business segments.

We follow a balanced approach to investing for both current income and prudent risk management, with an emphasis on generating sufficient current income, net of income tax, to meet our obligations to customers, as well as other general liabilities. This balanced approach requires the evaluation of expected return and risk of each asset class utilized, while still meeting our income objectives. This approach is important to our asset-liability management because decisions can be made based upon both the economic and current investment income considerations affecting assets and liabilities. For a discussion of our risk management process, see “Part II – Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” in our 2015 Form 10-K.   ﻿   Investment Portfolio Composition and Diversification   ﻿   Fundamental to our investment policy is diversification across asset classes. Our investment portfolio, excluding cash and invested cash, is composed of fixed maturity securities, mortgage loans on real estate, real estate (either wholly-owned or in joint ventures) and other long-term investments. We purchase investments for our segmented portfolios that have yield, duration and other characteristics that take into account the liabilities of the products being supported.    ﻿   We have the ability to maintain our investment holdings throughout credit cycles because of our capital position, the long-term nature of our liabilities and the matching of our portfolios of investment assets with the liabilities of our various products.        71            Fixed Maturity and Equity Securities Portfolios   ﻿   Fixed maturity and equity securities consist of portfolios classified as AFS and trading. Details underlying our fixed maturity and equity securities portfolios by industry classification (in millions) are presented in the tables below. These tables agree in total with the presentation of AFS securities in Note 4; however, the categories below represent a more detailed breakout of the AFS portfolio.

(2)    Includes unrealized gains and (losses) on impaired securities related to changes in the fair value of such securities subsequent to the impairment measurement date.  ﻿       73            AFS Securities   ﻿   In accordance with the AFS accounting guidance, we reflect stockholders’ equity as if unrealized gains and losses were actually recognized, and consider all related accounting adjustments that would occur upon such a hypothetical recognition of unrealized gains and losses. Such related balance sheet effects include adjustments to the balances of DAC, VOBA, DFEL, future contract benefits, other contract holder funds and deferred income taxes. Adjustments to each of these balances are charged or credited to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). For instance, DAC is adjusted upon the recognition of unrealized gains or losses because the    amortization of DAC is based upon an assumed emergence of gross profits on certain insurance business. Deferred income tax balances are also adjusted because unrealized gains or losses do not affect actual taxes currently paid.    ﻿   The quality of our AFS fixed maturity securities portfolio, as measured at estimated fair value and by the percentage of fixed maturity AFS securities invested in various ratings categories, relative to the entire fixed maturity AFS security portfolio (in millions) was as follows:   ﻿      ﻿                                                                                  ﻿                                                                                  ﻿        Rating Agency        As of March 31, 2016        As of December 31, 2015          NAIC        Equivalent        Amortized        Fair        % of        Amortized        Fair        % of          Designation (1)        Designation (1)        Cost        Value        Total        Cost        Value        Total          ﻿                                                                                  Investment Grade Securities                                                                          1        Aaa / Aa / A        $  44,503 				       $  49,193 				     55.5% 				       $  44,614 				       $  47,845 				     55.9% 				         2        Baa          34,240 				         35,564 				     40.1% 				         33,918 				         34,077 				     39.8% 				         Total investment grade securities          78,743 				         84,757 				     95.6% 				         78,532 				         81,922 				     95.7% 				         ﻿                                                                                  Below Investment Grade Securities                                                                          3        Ba          2,662 				         2,499 				     2.8% 				         2,707 				         2,486 				     2.9% 				         4        B          1,454 				         1,188 				     1.3% 				         1,140 				         988 				     1.2% 				         5        Caa and lower          221 				         149 				     0.2% 				         188 				         146 				     0.2% 				         6        In or near default          140 				         70 				     0.1% 				         22 				         20 				     0.0% 				         Total below investment grade securities          4,477 				         3,906 				     4.4% 				         4,057 				         3,640 				     4.3% 				         Total fixed maturity AFS securities        $  83,220 				       $  88,663 				     100.0% 				       $  82,589 				       $  85,562 				     100.0% 				         ﻿                                                                                  Total securities below investment                                                                          grade as a percentage of total                                                                          fixed maturity AFS securities          5.4% 				         4.4% 				                 4.9% 				         4.3% 				                ﻿     (1)    Based upon the rating designations determined and provided by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”) or the major credit rating agencies (Fitch Ratings (“Fitch”), Moody’s Investors Service (“Moody’s”) and Standard & Poor’s (“S&P”)). For securities where the ratings assigned by the major credit rating agencies are not equivalent, the second highest rating assigned is used. For those securities where ratings by the major credit rating agencies are not available, which does not represent a significant amount of our total fixed maturity AFS securities, we base the ratings disclosed upon internal ratings. The average credit quality was A- as of March 31, 2016.   ﻿   Comparisons between the NAIC ratings and rating agency designations are published by the NAIC. The NAIC assigns securities quality ratings and uniform valuations, which are used by insurers when preparing their annual statements. The NAIC ratings are similar to the rating agency designations of the Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations for marketable bonds. NAIC ratings 1 and 2 include bonds generally considered investment grade (rated Baa3 or higher by Moody’s, or rated BBB- or higher by S&P and Fitch) by such ratings organizations. However, securities rated NAIC 1 and 2 could be deemed below investment grade by the rating agencies as a result of the current RBC rules for residential mortgage-backed securities (“RMBS”) and CMBS for statutory reporting. NAIC ratings 3 through 6 include bonds generally considered below investment grade (rated Ba or lower by Moody’s, or rated BB+ or lower by S&P and Fitch).    ﻿   As of March 31, 2016, and December 31, 2015, 85.4% and 91.8%, respectively, of the total publicly traded and private securities in an unrealized loss status were rated as investment grade. Our gross unrealized losses, including the portion of OTTI recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) (“OCI”), on AFS securities as of March 31, 2016, decreased by $645 million. As more fully described in Note 1 in our 2015 Form 10-K, we regularly review our investment holdings for OTTI. We believe the unrealized loss position as of March 31, 2016, does not represent OTTI as: (i) we do not intend to sell the debt securities; (ii) it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the debt securities before recovery of their amortized cost; (iii) the estimated future cash flows are equal to or greater than the amortized cost of the debt securities; and (iv) we have the ability and intent to hold the equity securities for a period of time sufficient for recovery.

﻿     (2)    Does not include the amortized cost, unrealized gain (loss) and fair value of trading securities totaling $137 million, $6 million and $143 million, respectively.   ﻿   We concluded: (i) that it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the fixed maturity AFS securities before recovery of their amortized cost; (ii) that the estimated future cash flows are equal to or greater than the amortized cost of the debt securities; and (iii) that we have the ability to hold the equity AFS securities for a period of time sufficient for recovery. This conclusion is consistent with our asset-liability management process. Management considers the following as part of the evaluation:   ﻿     ·    The current economic environment and market conditions;    ·    Our business strategy and current business plans;    ·    The nature and type of security, including expected maturities and exposure to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risk;    ·    Our analysis of data from financial models and other internal and industry sources to evaluate the current effectiveness of our hedging and overall risk management strategies;    ·    The current and expected timing of contractual maturities of our assets and liabilities, expectations of prepayments on investments and expectations for surrenders and withdrawals of life insurance policies and annuity contracts;    ·    The capital risk limits approved by management; and    ·    Our current financial condition and liquidity demands.  ﻿   To determine the recoverability of a debt security, we consider the facts and circumstances surrounding the underlying issuer including, but not limited to, the following:   ﻿     ·    Historical and implied volatility of the security;    ·    Length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than amortized cost;     ·    Adverse conditions specifically related to the security or to specific conditions in an industry or geographic area;     ·    Failure, if any, of the issuer of the security to make scheduled payments; and    ·    Recoveries or additional declines in fair value subsequent to the balance sheet date.   ﻿   As reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, we had $109.6 billion of investments and cash, which exceeded the liabilities for our future obligations under insurance policies and contracts, net of amounts recoverable from reinsurers, which totaled $93.3 billion as of March 31, 2016. If it were necessary to liquidate investments prior to maturity or call to meet cash flow needs, we would first look to AFS securities that are in an unrealized gain position, which had a fair value of $73.5 billion, excluding consolidated VIEs in the amount of $599 million, as of March 31, 2016, rather than selling securities in an unrealized loss position. The amount of cash that we have on hand takes into account our liquidity needs in the future, other sources of cash, such as the maturities of investments, interest and dividends we earn on our investments and the ongoing cash flows from new and existing business.    ﻿   See “AFS Securities – Evaluation for Recovery of Amortized Cost” in Note 1 in our 2015 Form 10-K and Note 4 herein for additional discussion.   ﻿   As of March 31, 2016, and December 31, 2015, the estimated fair value for all private placement securities was $14.4 billion and $14.0 billion, respectively, representing 14% of total invested assets.   ﻿   For information regarding our VIEs’ fixed maturity securities, see Note 3 herein and Note 4 in our 2015 Form 10-K.        76         ﻿   Mortgage-Backed Securities (Included in AFS and Trading Securities)   ﻿   See “Part II – Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Consolidated Investments – Mortgage-Backed Securities” in our 2015 Form 10-K for a discussion of our mortgage-backed securities (“MBS”).    ﻿   Our ABS home equity and RMBS had a market value of $4.4 billion and an unrealized gain of $176 million, or 4%, as of March 31, 2016.    ﻿   The market value of AFS securities and trading securities backed by subprime loans was $526 million and represented approximately 1% of our total investment portfolio as of March 31, 2016.  AFS securities represented $517 million, or 98%, and trading securities represented $9 million, or 2%, of the subprime exposure as of March 31, 2016.

We are not aware of material exposure to subprime loans in our alternative asset portfolio.   ﻿       77         The following summarizes our investments in AFS securities backed by pools of commercial mortgages (in millions) as of March 31, 2016:   ﻿      ﻿                                                                                                      ﻿                                                                                                      ﻿    Multiple Property        Single Property        CRE CDOs        Total          ﻿    Fair        Amortized        Fair        Amortized        Fair        Amortized        Fair        Amortized          ﻿    Value        Cost        Value        Cost        Value        Cost        Value        Cost          Type                                                                                                       CMBS    $  336 				       $  324 				       $  13 				       $  12 				       $     -        $     -        $  349 				       $  336 				         CRE CDOs         -             -             -             -          16 				         16 				         16 				         16 				         Total by type (1)(2)    $  336 				       $  324 				       $  13 				       $  12 				       $  16 				       $  16 				       $  365 				       $  352 				         ﻿                                                                                                      Rating                                                                                                      AAA    $  174 				       $  169 				       $     -        $     -        $     -        $     -        $  174 				       $  169 				         AA      21 				         21 				            -             -             -             -          21 				         21 				         A      73 				         69 				         13 				         12 				            -             -          86 				         81 				         BBB      22 				         22 				            -             -          4 				         4 				         26 				         26 				         BB and below      46 				         43 				            -             -          12 				         12 				         58 				         55 				         Total by rating (1)(2)(3)    $  336 				       $  324 				       $  13 				       $  12 				       $  16 				       $  16 				       $  365 				       $  352 				         ﻿                                                                                                      Origination Year                                                                                                      2006 and prior    $  114 				       $  113 				       $  13 				       $  12 				       $  16 				       $  16 				       $  143 				       $  141 				         2007      50 				         43 				            -             -             -             -          50 				         43 				         2010      51 				         48 				            -             -             -             -          51 				         48 				         2012      5 				         5 				            -             -             -             -          5 				         5 				         2013      116 				         115 				            -             -             -             -          116 				         115 				         Total by origination                                                                                                       year (1)(2)    $  336 				       $  324 				       $  13 				       $  12 				       $  16 				       $  16 				       $  365 				       $  352 				         ﻿                                                                                                      Total AFS securities backed by pools of commercial mortgages as a percentage of total AFS securities      0.4% 				         0.4% 				        ﻿     (1)    Does not include the fair value of trading securities totaling $3 million, which support our Modco reinsurance agreements because investment results for these agreements are passed directly to the reinsurers.

Further, because the timing of the recognition of realized investment gains and losses through the selection of which securities are sold is largely at management’s discretion, it is important to consider the information provided below within the context of the overall unrealized gain or loss position of our investment portfolios.

The profitability of our fixed annuity and life insurance products is affected by our ability to achieve target spreads, or margins, between the interest income earned on the general account assets and the interest credited to the contract holder on our average fixed account values, including the fixed portion of variable. Net investment income and the interest rate yield table each include commercial mortgage loan prepayments and bond make-whole premiums, alternative investments and contingent interest and standby real estate equity commitments. These items can vary significantly from period to period due to a number of factors and, therefore, can provide results that are not indicative of the underlying trends.   ﻿   Commercial Mortgage Loan Prepayment and Bond Make-Whole Premiums   ﻿   Prepayment and make-whole premiums are collected when borrowers elect to call or prepay their debt prior to the stated maturity. A prepayment or make-whole premium allows investors to attain the same yield as if the borrower made all scheduled interest payments until maturity. These premiums are designed to make investors indifferent to prepayment.   ﻿   Realized Gain (Loss) Related to Certain Investments   ﻿   Details of the realized gain (loss) related to certain investments (in millions) were as follows:   ﻿      ﻿                                  ﻿                                  ﻿    For the Three              ﻿    Months Ended              ﻿    March 31,              ﻿    2016        2015              Fixed maturity AFS securities: (1)                                  Gross gains    $  54 				       $  2 				             Gross losses      (98 				   )      (16 				   )          Equity AFS securities:                                  Gross gains         -             -              Gross losses         -             -              Gain (loss) on other investments      (60 				   )      (7 				   )          Associated amortization of DAC, VOBA,                                  DSI and DFEL and changes in                                   other contract holder funds      (3 				   )      (6 				   )          Total realized gain (loss) related to                                   certain investments, pre-tax    $  (107 				   )    $  (27 				   )         ﻿     (1)    These amounts are represented net of related fair value hedging activity. See Note 5 for more information.  ﻿   Amortization of DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL and changes in other contract holder funds reflect an assumption for an expected level of credit-related investment losses. When actual credit-related investment losses are realized, we recognize a true-up to our DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL amortization and changes in other contract holder funds within realized losses reflecting the incremental effect of actual versus expected credit-related investment losses. These actual to expected amortization adjustments could create volatility in net realized gains and losses. The write-down for impairments includes both credit-related and interest rate-related impairments.       82         Realized gains and losses generally originate from asset sales to reposition the portfolio or to respond to product experience. During the first three months of 2016 and 2015, we sold securities for gains and losses. In the process of evaluating whether a security with an unrealized loss reflects declines that are other-than-temporary, we consider our ability and intent to sell the security prior to a recovery of value. However, subsequent decisions on securities sales are made within the context of overall risk monitoring, assessing value relative to other comparable securities and overall portfolio maintenance. Although our portfolio managers may, at a given point in time, believe that the preferred course of action is to hold securities with unrealized losses that are considered temporary until such losses are recovered, the dynamic nature of portfolio management may result in a subsequent decision to sell. These subsequent decisions are consistent with the classification of our investment portfolio as AFS. We expect to continue to manage all non-trading invested assets within our portfolios in a manner that is consistent with the AFS classification.    ﻿   We consider economic factors and circumstances within countries and industries where recent write-downs have occurred in our assessment of the status of securities we own of similarly situated issuers. While it is possible for realized or unrealized losses on a particular investment to affect other investments, our risk management strategy has been designed to identify correlation risks and other risks inherent in managing an investment portfolio. Once identified, strategies and procedures are developed to effectively monitor and manage these risks. The areas of risk correlation that we pay particular attention to are risks that may be correlated within specific financial and business markets, risks within specific industries and risks associated with related parties.   ﻿   When the detailed analysis by our external asset managers and investment portfolio managers leads us to the conclusion that a security’s decline in fair value is other-than-temporary, the security is written down to estimated recovery value. In instances where declines are considered temporary, the security will continue to be carefully monitored. See “Part II – Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Introduction – Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Investments – Write-downs for OTTI and Allowance for Losses” in our 2015 Form 10-K for additional information on our portfolio management strategy.   ﻿   Details underlying write-downs taken as a result of OTTI (in millions) were as follows:   ﻿      ﻿                                      ﻿                                      ﻿    For the Three                  ﻿    Months Ended                  ﻿    March 31,                  ﻿    2016        2015        Change          OTTI Recognized in Net Income (Loss)                                      Fixed maturity securities:                                      Corporate bonds    $  (36 				   )    $  (11 				   )    NM          ABS      (2 				   )      (2 				   )  0% 				         RMBS      (2 				   )      (2 				   )  0% 				         Gross OTTI recognized in net income (loss)      (40 				   )      (15 				   )    NM          Associated amortization of DAC,                                      VOBA, DSI and DFEL      4 				         2 				     100% 				         Net OTTI recognized in net income                                       (loss), pre-tax    $  (36 				   )    $  (13 				   )    NM          ﻿                                      Portion of OTTI Recognized in OCI                                       Gross OTTI recognized in OCI    $  26 				       $  9 				     189% 				         Change in DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL      (6 				   )      (2 				   )    NM          Net portion of OTTI recognized in OCI,                                       pre-tax    $  20 				       $  7 				     186% 				        ﻿   The $66 million of impairments taken during the first three months of 2016 were split between $40 million of credit-related impairments and $26 million of noncredit-related impairments. The increase in write-downs for OTTI when comparing the first three months of 2016 to the corresponding period in 2015 was primarily attributable to certain corporate bond holdings within the energy and other commodity sectors that experienced deteriorating fundamentals. The noncredit-related impairments were due to declines in values of securities for which we do not have an intent to sell or it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the securities before recovery.   ﻿   REVIEW OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION   ﻿   Liquidity and Capital Resources   ﻿   Sources of Liquidity and Cash Flow   ﻿   ﻿   Liquidity refers to the ability of an enterprise to generate adequate amounts of cash from its normal operations to meet cash requirements with a prudent margin of safety. Our principal sources of cash flow from operating activities are insurance premiums and fees and investment income, while sources of cash flows from investing activities result from maturities and sales of invested assets. Our operating activities provided cash of $295 million and $296 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. When considering our liquidity and cash flow, it is important to distinguish between the needs of our insurance subsidiaries and the needs      83         of the holding company, LNC. As a holding company with no operations of its own, LNC derives its cash primarily from its operating subsidiaries.    ﻿   The sources of liquidity of the holding company are principally comprised of dividends and interest payments from subsidiaries, augmented by holding company short-term investments, bank lines of credit and the ongoing availability of long-term public financing under an SEC-filed shelf registration statement. These sources of liquidity and cash flow support the general corporate needs of the holding company, including its common stock dividends, interest and debt service, funding of callable securities, securities repurchases, acquisitions and investment in core businesses.    ﻿   Details underlying the primary sources of our holding company cash flows (in millions) were as follows:   ﻿      ﻿                                      ﻿                                      ﻿    For the Three                  ﻿    Months Ended                  ﻿    March 31,                  ﻿    2016        2015        Change          Dividends from Subsidiaries                                      The Lincoln National Life Insurance                                      Company    $  200 				       $  400 				       -50%          ﻿                                      Loan Repayments and Interest from                                      Subsidiaries                                      Interest on inter-company notes      30 				         29 				     3% 				         ﻿    $  230 				       $  429 				       -46%          Other Cash Flow and Liquidity Items                                      Net capital received from (paid for taxes on)                                      stock option exercises and restricted stock    $  11 				       $  10 				     10% 				        ﻿   The table above focuses on significant and recurring cash flow items and excludes the effects of certain financing activities, namely the periodic issuance and retirement of debt and cash flows related to our inter-company cash management program (discussed below). Taxes have been eliminated from the analysis due to a tax sharing agreement among our primary subsidiaries resulting in a modest effect on net cash flows at the holding company. Also excluded from this analysis is the modest amount of investment income on short-term investments of the holding company. For information regarding limits on the dividends that our insurance subsidiaries may pay, see “Part II – Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Review of Consolidated Financial Condition – Liquidity and Capital Resources – Restrictions on Dividends from Subsidiaries” in our 2015 Form 10-K.    ﻿   Insurance Subsidiaries’ Statutory Capital and Surplus   ﻿   Our regulatory capital levels are also affected by statutory accounting rules, which are subject to change by each applicable insurance regulator. Our term products and UL products containing secondary guarantees require reserves calculated pursuant to XXX and AG38, respectively. During the third quarter of 2013, the New York State Department of Financial Services announced that it would not recognize the NAIC revisions to AG38 in applying the New York law governing the reserves to be held for UL and VUL products containing secondary guarantees. The change, which was effective as of December 31, 2013, impacted the Lincoln Life & Annuity Company of New York (“LLANY”). Although LLANY discontinued the sale of these products in early 2013, the change affected those policies previously sold. We began phasing in the increase in reserves over five years beginning in 2013. As of March 31, 2016, we have increased reserves by $270 million.  We do not expect the amount for each of the remaining years to exceed $90 million per year. We do not expect the total reserve increase to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.   ﻿   As discussed in “Part I – Item 1. Risk Factors – Legislative, Regulatory, and Tax – Attempts to mitigate the impact of Regulation XXX and Actuarial Guideline 38 may fail in whole or in part resulting in an adverse effect on our financial condition and result of operations,” our insurance subsidiaries employ strategies to reduce the strain caused by XXX and AG38 by reinsuring the business to insurance captives. Our captive reinsurance and reinsurance subsidiaries provide a mechanism for financing a portion of the excess reserve amounts in a more efficient manner. We use long-dated LOCs and debt financing as well as other financing strategies to finance those reserves. Included in the LOCs issued as of March 31, 2016, was approximately $3.4 billion of long-dated LOCs issued to support inter-company reinsurance arrangements. Approximately $2.3 billion of such LOCs were issued to support reinsurance for UL products containing secondary guarantees ($1 million will expire in 2018, $350 million will expire in 2019, and $1.9 billion will expire in 2031), and $1.1 billion of such LOCs that will expire in 2023 were issued to support reinsurance for term business. We have also used the proceeds from senior note issuances of $875 million to execute long-term structured solutions supporting reinsurance of UL products containing secondary guarantees. Additionally, our captive reinsurance and reinsurance subsidiaries have issued long-term notes of $1.6 billion as of March 31, 2016, to finance a portion of the excess reserves. For information on these long-term notes issued by our captive reinsurance and reinsurance subsidiaries, see Note 4 in our 2015 Form 10-K. LOCs and related capital market solutions lower the capital effect of term products and UL products containing secondary guarantees.  An inability to obtain appropriate capital market solutions could affect our returns on our in-force term products and UL products containing secondary guarantees. However, we believe that we have      84         sufficient capital to support the increase in statutory reserves, based on our current reserve projections, if such structures were no longer available.   Our captive reinsurance subsidiaries free up capital the insurance subsidiaries can use for any number of purposes, including paying dividends to the holding company. Once transferred to the holding company, it can deploy this capital for a variety of corporate purposes, including potential stock repurchases. Actuarial Guideline 48 (“AG48”) regulates the terms of captive reinsurance arrangements that are entered into or amended in certain ways after December 31, 2014. AG48 imposes restrictions on the types of assets that can be used to support these arrangements. We believe that we will be able to implement these arrangements in compliance with AG48.   ﻿   Statutory reserves established for variable annuity contracts and riders are sensitive to changes in the equity markets and are affected by the level of account values relative to the level of any guarantees, product design and reinsurance arrangements. As a result, the relationship between reserve changes and equity market performance is non-linear during any given reporting period. Market conditions greatly influence the ultimate capital required due to its effect on the valuation of reserves and derivative assets hedging these reserves. We also utilize inter-company reinsurance arrangements to manage our hedge program for variable annuity guarantees. The NAIC through its various committees, task forces and working groups has been studying the use of captives and special purpose vehicles to transfer insurance risk and has been evaluating the adequacy of existing NAIC model laws and regulations applicable to annuity captives.   ﻿   We continue to analyze the use of our existing captive reinsurance structures, as well as additional third-party reinsurance arrangements, and our current hedging strategies relative to managing the effects of equity markets and interest rates on the statutory reserves, statutory capital and the dividend capacity of our life insurance subsidiaries.   ﻿   Financing Activities   ﻿   Although our subsidiaries currently generate adequate cash flow to meet the needs of our normal operations, periodically we may issue debt or equity securities to maintain ratings and increase liquidity, as well as to fund internal growth, acquisitions and the retirement of our debt and equity securities.    ﻿   We currently have an effective shelf registration statement, which allows us to issue, in unlimited amounts, securities, including debt securities, preferred stock, common stock, warrants, stock purchase contracts, stock purchase units and depository shares.    ﻿   Details underlying debt and financing activities (in millions) for the three months ended March 31, 2016, were as follows:   ﻿      ﻿                                                                                          ﻿          ﻿                                Maturities,        Change                                      ﻿                                Repayments        in Fair                                      ﻿    Beginning                         and         Value            Other            Ending      ﻿    Balance        Issuance        Refinancing        Hedges        Changes (1)        Balance      Short-Term Debt                                                                                          Current maturities of long-term debt    $     -        $     -            $     -            $     -            $     -            $     -      ﻿                                                                                          Long-Term Debt                                                                                          Senior notes    $  3,846 				       $     -            $     -            $  95 				           $  2 				           $  3,943 				     Bank borrowing       250 				            -                 -                 -                 -              250 				     Federal Home Loan Bank of                                                                                          Indianapolis advance      250 				            -                 -                 -                 -              250 				     Capital securities       1,207 				            -                 -                 -                 -              1,207 				     Total long-term debt    $  5,553 				       $     -            $     -            $  95 				           $  2 				           $  5,650 				    ﻿     (1)    Includes the net increase (decrease) in commercial paper, non-cash reclassification of long-term debt to current maturities of long-term debt, accretion of discounts and (amortization) of premiums, as applicable.  ﻿   As of March 31, 2016, the holding company had available liquidity of $539 million. Available liquidity consists of cash and invested cash, excluding cash held as collateral, and certain short-term investments that can be readily converted into cash, net of commercial paper outstanding.    ﻿   For more information about our short-term and long-term debt and our credit facilities and LOCs, see Note 12 in our 2015 Form 10-K.   ﻿   We have not accounted for repurchase agreements, securities lending transactions, or other transactions involving the transfer of financial assets with an obligation to repurchase the transferred assets as sales. For information about our collateralized financing transactions on our investments, see “Payables for Collateral on Investments” in Note 4.   ﻿   If current credit ratings and claims-paying ratings were downgraded in the future, terms in our derivative agreements may be triggered, which could negatively affect overall liquidity. For the majority of our counterparties, there is a termination event should the long-term senior debt ratings of LNC drop below BBB-/Baa3 (S&P/Moody’s). Our long-term senior debt held a rating of A-/Baa1 (S&P/Moody’s) as of March 31, 2016. In addition, contractual selling agreements with intermediaries could be negatively affected, which      85         could have an adverse effect on overall sales of annuities, life insurance and investment products. See “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors – Liquidity and Capital Position – A decrease in the capital and surplus of our insurance subsidiaries may result in a downgrade to our credit and insurer financial strength ratings” and “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors – Covenants and Ratings – A downgrade in our financial strength or credit ratings could limit our ability to market products, increase the number or value of policies being surrendered and/or hurt our relationships with creditors” in our 2015 Form 10-K for more information. See “Part I – Item 1. Business – Financial Strength Ratings” in our 2015 Form 10-K for additional information on our current financial strength ratings.   ﻿   See “Part II – Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Review of Consolidated Financial Condition – Liquidity and Capital Resources – Financing Activities” in our 2015 Form 10-K for information on our credit ratings.   ﻿   Alternative Sources of Liquidity   ﻿   In order to manage our capital more efficiently, we have an inter-company cash management program where certain subsidiaries can lend to or borrow from the holding company to meet short-term borrowing needs. The cash management program is essentially a series of demand loans between LNC and participating subsidiaries that reduces overall borrowing costs by allowing LNC and its subsidiaries to access internal resources instead of incurring third-party transaction costs. As of March 31, 2016, the holding company had a net outstanding payable of $117 million to certain subsidiaries resulting from loans made by subsidiaries in excess of amounts borrowed by subsidiaries in the inter-company cash management account. Any change in holding company cash management program balances is offset by the immediate and equal change in holding company cash and invested cash. Loans under the cash management program are permitted under applicable insurance laws subject to certain restrictions. For our Indiana-domiciled insurance subsidiaries, the borrowing and lending limit is currently 3% of the insurance company’s admitted assets as of its most recent year end. For our New York-domiciled insurance subsidiary, it may borrow from LNC less than 2% of its admitted assets as of the last year end but may not lend any amounts to LNC.   ﻿   Our insurance subsidiaries, by virtue of their general account fixed-income investment holdings, can access liquidity through securities lending programs and repurchase agreements. As of March 31, 2016, our insurance subsidiaries had investments with a carrying value of $2.9 billion out on loan or subject to repurchase agreements. The cash received in our securities lending programs and repurchase agreements is typically invested in cash equivalents, short-term investments or fixed maturity securities. For additional details, see “Payables for Collateral on Investments” in Note 4.   ﻿   Cash Flows from Collateral on Derivatives   ﻿   Our cash flows associated with collateral received from and posted with counterparties change as the market value of the underlying derivative contract changes. As the value of a derivative asset decreases (or increases), the collateral required to be posted by our counterparties would also decrease (or increase). Likewise, when the value of a derivative liability decreases (or increases), the collateral we are required to post to our counterparties would also decrease (or increase). During the three months ended March 31, 2016, our payables for collateral on derivative investments increased by $772 million due primarily to decreasing interest rates that increased the fair values of our associated derivative investments. In the event of adverse changes in fair value of our derivative instruments, we may need to post collateral with a counterparty if our net derivative liability position reaches certain contractual levels. If we do not have sufficient high quality securities or cash and invested cash to provide as collateral, we have multiple liquidity sources to leverage that would be eligible for collateral posting. For additional information, see “Credit Risk” in Note 5.   ﻿   Divestitures   ﻿   For a discussion of our divestitures, see Note 3 in our 2015 Form 10-K.   ﻿   Uses of Capital   ﻿   Our principal uses of cash are to pay policy claims and benefits, operating expenses, commissions and taxes, to purchase new investments, to purchase reinsurance, to fund policy surrenders and withdrawals, to pay dividends to our stockholders, to repurchase our stock and to repay debt.    ﻿   Return of Capital to Common Stockholders    ﻿   One of the Company’s primary goals is to provide a return to our common stockholders through share price accretion, dividends and stock repurchases. In determining dividends, the Board of Directors takes into consideration items such as current and expected earnings, capital needs, rating agency considerations and requirements for financial flexibility. The amount and timing of share repurchase depends on key capital ratios, rating agency expectations, the generation of free cash flow and an evaluation of the costs and benefits associated with alternative uses of capital. Free cash flow for the holding company generally represents the amount of dividends and interest received from subsidiaries less interest paid on debt.   ﻿       86            Details underlying this activity (in millions, except per share data), were as follows:   ﻿      ﻿                                      ﻿                                      ﻿    For the Three                  ﻿    Months Ended                  ﻿    March 31,                  ﻿    2016        2015        Change          Common dividends to stockholders    $  61 				       $  51 				     20% 				         Repurchase of common stock      200 				         350 				       -43%          Total cash returned to stockholders    $  261 				       $  401 				       -35%          ﻿                                      Number of shares repurchased      5.516 				         6.043 				       -9%          Average price per share    $  36.26 				       $  57.94 				       -37%         ﻿   On October 28, 2015, our Board of Directors approved an increase of the quarterly dividend on our common stock from $0.20 to $0.25 per share. Additionally, we expect to repurchase additional shares of common stock during 2016 depending on market conditions and alternative uses of capital. For more information regarding share repurchases, see “Part II – Item 2(c)” below.   ﻿   Other Uses of Capital   ﻿   In addition to the amounts in the table above in “Return of Capital to Common Stockholders,” other uses of holding company cash flow (in millions) were as follows:   ﻿      ﻿                                      ﻿                                      ﻿    For the Three                  ﻿    Months Ended                  ﻿    March 31,                  ﻿    2016        2015        Change          Debt service (interest paid)    $  65 				       $  59 				     10% 				         Capital contribution to subsidiaries         -          75 				       -100%          Total    $  65 				       $  134 				       -51%         ﻿   The above table focuses on significant and recurring cash flow items and excludes the effects of certain financing activities, namely the periodic retirement of debt and cash flows related to our inter-company cash management account. Taxes have been eliminated from the analysis due to a tax sharing agreement among our primary subsidiaries resulting in a modest effect on net cash flows at the holding company.   ﻿   Significant Trends in Sources and Uses of Cash Flow   ﻿   As stated above, LNC’s cash flow, as a holding company, is largely dependent upon the dividend capacity of its insurance company subsidiaries as well as their ability to advance funds to it through inter-company borrowing arrangements, which may be affected by factors influencing the insurance subsidiaries’ RBC and statutory earnings performance. We currently expect to be able to meet the holding company’s ongoing cash needs and to have sufficient capital to offer downside protection in the event that the capital and credit markets experience another period of extreme volatility and disruption. A decline in capital market conditions, which reduces our insurance subsidiaries’ statutory surplus and RBC, may require them to retain more capital and may pressure our subsidiaries’ dividends to the holding company, which may lead us to take steps to preserve or raise additional capital. For factors that could affect our expectations for liquidity and capital, see “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2015 Form 10-K as updated by “Item 1A. Risk Factors” below.   ﻿   For factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in this section, see “Forward-Looking Statements – Cautionary Language” above and “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2015 Form 10-K as updated by “Item 1A. Risk Factors” below.   ﻿   OTHER MATTERS   ﻿   Other Factors Affecting Our Business       In general, our businesses are subject to a changing social, economic, legal, legislative and regulatory environment. Some of the changes include initiatives to require more reserves to be carried by our insurance subsidiaries. Although the eventual effect on us of the changing environment in which we operate remains uncertain, these factors and others could have a material effect on our results of operations, liquidity and capital resources. For factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in this section, see “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2015 Form 10-K as updated by “Item 1A. Risk Factors” below and “Forward-Looking Statements – Cautionary Language” above.    ﻿       87            Recent Accounting Pronouncements   ﻿   See Note 2 for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements that have been implemented during the periods presented or that have been issued and are to be implemented in the future.   ﻿   Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk    ﻿   We analyze and manage the risks arising from market exposures of financial instruments, as well as other risks, in an integrated asset-liability management process that considers diversification. By aggregating the potential effect of market and other risks on the entire enterprise, we estimate, review and in some cases manage the risk to our earnings and shareholder value. We have exposures to several market risks including interest rate risk, equity market risk, default risk, credit risk and, to a lesser extent, foreign currency exchange risk. The exposures of financial instruments to market risks, and the related risk management processes, are most important to our business where most of the invested assets support accumulation and investment-oriented insurance products. As an important element of our integrated asset-liability management processes, we use derivatives to minimize the effects of changes in interest levels, the shape of the yield curve, currency movements and volatility. In this context, derivatives serve to minimize interest rate risk by mitigating the effect of significant increases in interest rates on our earnings. Additional market exposures exist in our other general account insurance products and in our debt structure and derivatives positions. Our primary sources of market risk are substantial, relatively rapid and sustained increases or decreases in interest rates or a sharp drop in equity market values. These market risks are discussed in detail in the following pages and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements presented in “Item 1. Financial Statements,” as well as “Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”   ﻿   Interest Rate Risk     ﻿   Effect of Interest Rate Sensitivity   ﻿   For information about the effect of interest rate sensitivity on our income (loss) from operations, see “Part II – Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – Interest Rate Risk – Effect of Interest Rate Sensitivity” in our 2015 Form 10-K.   ﻿   Interest Rate Risk on Fixed Insurance Businesses    ﻿   In periods of low interest rates, we have to reinvest the cash we receive as interest or return of principal on our investments in lower yielding instruments. Moreover, borrowers may prepay fixed-income securities, commercial mortgages and mortgage-backed securities in our general accounts in order to borrow at lower market rates, which exacerbates this risk. Because we are entitled to reset the interest rates on our fixed-rate annuities only at limited, pre-established intervals, and because many of our contracts have guaranteed minimum interest or crediting rates, our spreads could decrease and potentially become negative.    ﻿   Prolonged historically low rates are not healthy for our business fundamentals. However, we have recognized this risk and have been proactive in our investment strategies, product designs, crediting rate strategies and overall asset-liability practices to mitigate the risk of unfavorable consequences in this type of environment. For some time now, new products have been sold with low minimum crediting floors, and we apply disciplined asset-liability management standards, such as locking in spreads on these products at the time of issue. See “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors – Market Conditions – Changes in interest rates and sustained low interest rates may cause interest rate spreads to decrease and changes in interest rates may also result in increased contract withdrawals” in our 2015 Form 10-K for additional information on interest rate risks.   ﻿       88            The following provides detail on the percentage differences between the March 31, 2016, interest rates being credited to contract holders based on the first quarter of 2016 declared rates and the respective minimum guaranteed policy rate (in millions), broken out by contract holder account values reported within our segments:   ﻿   ﻿      ﻿                                                                          ﻿                                                                          ﻿    Account Values          ﻿                Retirement                                %           ﻿                    Plan            Life                         Account          ﻿    Annuities            Services        Insurance (1)        Total        Values          Excess of Crediting Rates over Contract Minimums                                                                          Discretionary rate setting products: (2)                                                                          Occurring within the next twelve months: (3)                                                                          No difference    $  8,000 				           $  10,828 				           $  32,446 				           $  51,274 				     70.6% 				         Up to 0.50%      1,616 				             554 				             457 				             2,627 				     3.6% 				         0.51% to 1.00%      2,547 				             406 				                -              2,953 				     4.1% 				         1.01% to 1.50%      2,739 				             47 				             121 				             2,907 				     4.0% 				         1.51% to 2.00%      503 				                -              821 				             1,324 				     1.8% 				         2.01% to 2.50%      71 				                -                 -              71 				     0.1% 				         2.51% to 3.00%      106 				                -                 -              106 				     0.1% 				         3.01% or greater      43 				                -                 -              43 				     0.1% 				         Occurring after the next twelve months (4)      3,890 				                -                 -              3,890 				     5.4% 				         Total discretionary rate setting products       19,515 				             11,835 				             33,845 				             65,195 				     89.8% 				         Other contracts (5)      2,474 				             4,893 				                -              7,367 				     10.2% 				         Total account values    $  21,989 				           $  16,728 				           $  33,845 				           $  72,562 				     100.0% 				         ﻿                                                                          Percentage of discretionary rate setting product account                                                                          values at minimum guaranteed rates      41.0% 				             91.5% 				             95.9% 				             78.6% 				                ﻿     (1)    Excludes policy loans.

We devote extensive effort to evaluating the risks associated with falling interest rates by simulating asset and liability cash flows for a wide range of interest rate scenarios. We seek to manage these exposures by maintaining a suitable maturity structure and by limiting our exposure to call risk in each respective investment portfolio.   ﻿   Derivatives   ﻿   See Note 5 for information on our derivatives used to hedge our exposure to changes in interest rates.   ﻿   Equity Market Risk   ﻿   Our revenues, assets and liabilities are exposed to equity market risk that we often hedge with derivatives. Due to the use of our RTM process and our hedging strategies, we expect that, in general, short-term fluctuations in the equity markets should not have a significant effect on our quarterly earnings from unlocking of assumptions for DAC, VOBA, DSI, and DFEL. However, earnings are affected by equity market movements on account values and assets under management and the related fees we earn on those assets. Refer to “Part II – Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Introduction – Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL” in our 2015 Form 10-K for further discussion of the effects of equity markets on our RTM.    ﻿   Effect of Equity Market Sensitivity   ﻿   For information about the effect of equity market sensitivity on our income (loss) from operations, see “Part II – Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – Equity Market Risk – Effect of Equity Market Sensitivity” in our 2015 Form 10-K.       89         Credit Risk   ﻿   We may use credit-related derivatives to minimize our exposure to credit-related events, and we also sell credit default swaps to offer credit protection to our contract holders and investors.    ﻿   In addition to the information provided about our counterparty exposure in Note 5, the fair value of our exposure by rating (in millions) was as follows:   ﻿   ﻿      ﻿                                          ﻿        As of            As of              ﻿    March 31,    December 31,          ﻿        2016            2015              A        $  5 				           $  5 				             BBB          9 				             10 				             Total         $  14 				           $  15 				            ﻿   See Note 5 for additional information on our credit risk.    ﻿   Item 4. Controls and Procedures   ﻿   Conclusions Regarding Disclosure Controls and Procedures    ﻿   We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, which are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  As of the end of the period required by this report, we, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting them to material information relating to us and our consolidated subsidiaries required to be disclosed in our periodic reports under the Exchange Act.   ﻿   Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting    ﻿   There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended March 31, 2016, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.    ﻿   A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the company have been detected. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.    ﻿   ﻿       90         PART II – OTHER INFORMATION   ﻿   Item 1. Legal Proceedings   ﻿   Information regarding reportable legal proceedings is contained in Note 8 in “Part I – Item 1.”   ﻿   Item 1A.  Risk Factors   ﻿   Department of Labor regulation defining fiduciary could cause changes to the manner in which we deliver products and services as well as changes in nature and amount of compensation and fees.    ﻿   On April 8, 2016, the DOL released the final Definition of Fiduciary; Conflict of Interest Rule and related prohibited transaction exemptions (the “DOL Fiduciary Rule”), which, when effective, will substantially expand the range of activities that would be considered to be fiduciary investment advice under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and the Internal Revenue Code. The DOL Fiduciary Rule provides for a phased implementation of the provisions of this new regulation, the first of which will be effective on April 10, 2017, with full implementation by January 1, 2018. Under the DOL Fiduciary Rule, the investment-related information and support that our advisors and employees may provide to plan sponsors, participants and IRA holders on a non-fiduciary basis will be limited beyond what is allowed under the current law. As a result, changes to the methods that we use to (i) deliver products and services, and (ii) pay and receive compensation for our investment-related products and services may be required, which may impact sales or margins. In addition, if any of our advisors were to provide fiduciary investment advice as defined in the DOL Fiduciary Rule, it could also expose us and our advisors to additional risk of legal liability in connection with that advice. For additional information regarding the DOL proposed regulation, see “Item 1. Business – Regulatory – Insurance Regulation – Federal Initiatives – Department of Labor Regulation” in our 2015 Form 10-K.   ﻿   Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
