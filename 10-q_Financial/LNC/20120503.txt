Item 1A. Risk Factors,” “Part II – Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and “Part II – Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data”; and our current reports on Form 8-K filed in 2012.   In this report, in addition to providing consolidated revenues and net income (loss), we also provide segment operating revenues and income (loss) from operations because we believe they are meaningful measures of revenues and the profitability of our operating segments. Financial information that follows is presented in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”), unless otherwise indicated. See Note 1 in our 2011 Form 10-K for a discussion of GAAP.   Operating revenues and income (loss) from operations are the financial performance measures we use to evaluate and assess the results of our segments. Accordingly, we define and report operating revenues and income (loss) from operations by segment in Note 13. Our management believes that operating revenues and income (loss) from operations explain the results of our ongoing businesses in a manner that allows for a better understanding of the underlying trends in our current businesses because the excluded items are unpredictable and not necessarily indicative of current operating fundamentals or future performance of the business segments, and, in many instances, decisions regarding these items do not necessarily relate to the operations of the individual segments. In addition, we believe that our definitions of operating revenues and income (loss) from operations will provide investors with a more valuable measure of our performance because it better reveals trends in our business.   Certain reclassifications have been made to prior periods’ financial information.   FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS – CAUTIONARY LANGUAGE   Certain statements made in this report and in other written or oral statements made by us or on our behalf are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (“PSLRA”). A forward-looking statement is a statement that is not a historical fact and, without limitation, includes any statement that may predict, forecast, indicate or imply future results, performance or achievements, and may contain words like: “believe,” “anticipate,” “expect,” “estimate,” “project,” “will,” “shall” and other words or phrases with similar meaning in connection with a discussion of future operating or financial performance. In particular, these include statements relating to future actions, trends in our businesses, prospective services or products, future performance or financial results and the outcome of contingencies, such as legal proceedings. We claim the protection afforded by the safe harbor for forward-looking statements provided by the PSLRA.   Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from the results contained in the forward-looking statements. Risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to vary materially, some of which are described within the forward-looking statements, include, among others:       ·    Deterioration in general economic and business conditions that may affect account values, investment results, guaranteed benefit liabilities, premium levels, claims experience and the level of pension benefit costs, funding and investment results;        ·    Adverse global capital and credit market conditions could affect our ability to raise capital, if necessary, and may cause us to realize impairments on investments and certain intangible assets, including goodwill and a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets, which may reduce future earnings and/or affect our financial condition and ability to raise additional capital or refinance existing debt as it matures;        ·    Because of our holding company structure, the inability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends to the holding company in sufficient amounts could harm the holding company’s ability to meet its obligations;        ·    Legislative, regulatory or tax changes, both domestic and foreign, that affect the cost of, or demand for, our subsidiaries’ products, the required amount of reserves and/or surplus, or otherwise affect our ability to conduct business, including changes to statutory reserve requirements related to secondary guarantees under universal life, such as a change to reserve calculations under Actuarial Guideline 38 (also known as The Application of the Valuation of Life Insurance Policies Model Regulation, or “AG38”), and variable annuity products under Actuarial Guideline 43 (also known as Commissioners Annuity Reserve Valuation Method for Variable Annuities, or “AG43”); restrictions on revenue sharing and 12b-1 payments; and the potential for U.S. federal tax reform;             40                     ·    Uncertainty about the effect of rules and regulations to be promulgated under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act on us and the economy and the financial services sector in particular;        ·    The initiation of legal or regulatory proceedings against us, and the outcome of any legal or regulatory proceedings, such as: adverse actions related to present or past business practices common in businesses in which we compete; adverse decisions in significant actions including, but not limited to, actions brought by federal and state authorities and class action cases; new decisions that result in changes in law; and unexpected trial court rulings;        ·    Declines in or sustained low interest rates causing a reduction in investment income, the interest margins of our businesses, estimated gross profits and demand for our products;        ·    A decline in the equity markets causing a reduction in the sales of our subsidiaries’ products, a reduction of asset-based fees that our subsidiaries charge on various investment and insurance products, an acceleration of the net amortization of deferred acquisition costs (“DAC”), value of business acquired (“VOBA”), deferred sales inducements (“DSI”) and deferred front-end loads (“DFEL”) and an increase in liabilities related to guaranteed benefit features of our subsidiaries’ variable annuity products;        ·    Ineffectiveness of our risk management policies and procedures, including various hedging strategies used to offset the effect of changes in the value of liabilities due to changes in the level and volatility of the equity markets and interest rates;        ·    A deviation in actual experience regarding future persistency, mortality, morbidity, interest rates or equity market returns from the assumptions used in pricing our subsidiaries’ products, in establishing related insurance reserves and in the net amortization of DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL, which may reduce future earnings;        ·    Changes in GAAP, including the potential incorporation of International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) into the U.S. financial reporting system, that may result in unanticipated changes to our net income;        ·    Lowering of one or more of our debt ratings issued by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations and the adverse effect such action may have on our ability to raise capital and on our liquidity and financial condition;        ·    Lowering of one or more of the insurer financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries and the adverse effect such action may have on the premium writings, policy retention, profitability of our insurance subsidiaries and liquidity;        ·    Significant credit, accounting, fraud, corporate governance or other issues that may adversely affect the value of certain investments in our portfolios, as well as counterparties to which we are exposed to credit risk, requiring that we realize losses on investments;        ·    The effect of acquisitions and divestitures, restructurings, product withdrawals and other unusual items;        ·    The adequacy and collectibility of reinsurance that we have purchased;        ·    Acts of terrorism, a pandemic, war or other man-made and natural catastrophes that may adversely affect our businesses and the cost and availability of reinsurance;        ·    Competitive conditions, including pricing pressures, new product offerings and the emergence of new competitors, that may affect the level of premiums and fees that our subsidiaries can charge for their products;        ·    The unknown effect on our subsidiaries’ businesses resulting from changes in the demographics of their client base, as aging baby-boomers move from the asset-accumulation stage to the asset-distribution stage of life; and        ·    Loss of key management, financial planners or wholesalers.      The risks included here are not exhaustive. Our annual report on Form 10-K, current reports on Form 8-K and other documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) include additional factors that could affect our businesses and financial performance. Moreover, we operate in a rapidly changing and competitive environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors.   Further, it is not possible to assess the effect of all risk factors on our businesses or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results. In addition, we disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that occur after the date of this report.   INTRODUCTION   Executive Summary   We are a holding company that operates multiple insurance and retirement businesses through subsidiary companies. Through our business segments, we sell a wide range of wealth protection, accumulation and retirement income products and solutions. These products include fixed and indexed annuities, variable annuities, universal life insurance (“UL”), variable universal life insurance (“VUL”), linked-benefit UL, term life insurance, employer-sponsored defined contribution retirement plans, mutual funds and group life, disability and dental.          41               We provide products and services and report results through our Annuities, Retirement Plan Services, Life Insurance and Group Protection segments. We also have Other Operations. These segments and Other Operations are described in “Part I – Item 1. Business” of our 2011 Form 10-K.   For information on how we derive our revenues, see the discussion in results of operations by segment below.   Our current market conditions, significant operational matters, industry trends, issues and outlook are described in “Introduction – Executive Summary” of our 2011 Form 10-K.   For factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in this section, see “Forward-Looking Statements – Cautionary Language” above and “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2011 Form 10-K.   Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates   The MD&A included in our 2011 Form 10-K contains a detailed discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates. The following information updates the “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” provided in our 2011 Form 10-K and, accordingly, should be read in conjunction with the “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” discussed in our 2011 Form 10-K.   DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL   New DAC Methodology   In October 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2010-26, “Accounting for Costs Associated with Acquiring or Renewing Insurance Contracts” (referred to herein as the “new DAC methodology”), which clarifies the types of costs incurred by an insurance entity that can be capitalized in the acquisition of insurance contracts. Only those costs incurred that result directly from and are essential to the successful acquisition of new or renewal insurance contracts may be capitalized as deferrable acquisition costs. This determination of deferability must be made on a contract-level basis. This new DAC methodology contrasts to the prior guidance we followed that defined deferrable acquisition costs as costs that vary with and are related primarily to new or renewal business, regardless of whether the acquisition efforts were successful or unsuccessful.   Some examples of acquisition costs that remain subject to deferral as part of the new DAC methodology include the following:       ·    Employee, agent or broker commissions for successful contract acquisitions;        ·    Wholesaler production bonuses for successful contract acquisitions;        ·    Renewal commissions and bonuses to agents or brokers;        ·    Medical and inspection fees for successful contract acquisitions;        ·    Premium-related taxes and assessments; and        ·    A portion of the salaries and benefits of certain employees involved in the underwriting, contract issuance and processing, medical and inspection and sales force contract selling functions related to the successful issuance or renewal of an insurance contract.      All other acquisition-related costs, including costs incurred by the insurer for soliciting potential customers, market research, training, administration, management of distribution and underwriting functions, unsuccessful acquisition or renewal efforts and product development, are considered non-deferrable acquisition costs and must be expensed in the period incurred.   In addition, the following indirect costs are considered non-deferrable acquisition costs as part of the new DAC methodology and must be charged to expense in the period incurred:       ·    Administrative costs;        ·    Rent;        ·    Depreciation;        ·    Occupancy costs;        ·    Equipment costs (including data processing equipment dedicated to acquiring insurance contracts); and        ·    Other general overhead.      We adopted the new DAC methodology as of January 1, 2012, and elected to apply the guidance retrospectively. The retrospective adoption resulted in the restatement of all periods presented with a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings and accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (“AOCI”) for the earliest period presented. Further, our adoption of          42             the new DAC methodology resulted in an overall reduction in deferrable acquisition costs, partially offset by lower DAC amortization, in each of our business segments. See Note 2 for more discussion of the effect of adoption.   Reversion to the Mean (“RTM”)   As equity markets do not move in a systematic manner, we reset the baseline of account values from which estimated gross profits (“EGPs) are projected, which we refer to as our RTM process, as discussed in our 2011 Form 10-K.   Our long-term variable fund growth rate assumption, which is used in the determination of DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL amortization for our variable annuity and VUL products, is an immediate drop of approximately 14% followed by growth going forward of 8% to 9% depending on the block of business and reflecting differences in contract holder fund allocations between fixed income and equity-type investments. If we were to have unlocked our RTM assumption in the corridor as of March 31, 2012, we would have recorded a favorable prospective unlocking of approximately $240 million, pre-tax, for Annuities, approximately $20 million, pre-tax, for Retirement Plan Services, and approximately $20 million, pre-tax, for Life Insurance.   Investments   Investment Valuation   The following summarizes our available-for-sale (“AFS”) and trading securities and derivative investments carried at fair value by pricing source and fair value hierarchy level (in millions):         As of March 31, 2012          Quoted                                          Prices                                          in Active                                          Markets for     Significant     Significant                      Identical     Observable     Unobservable       Total          Assets     Inputs     Inputs       Fair          (Level 1)     (Level 2)     (Level 3)       Value        Priced by third party pricing services   $    680      $    67,534      $    -        $    68,214         Priced by independent broker quotations        -           -           3,363             3,363         Priced by matrices        -           9,216           -             9,216         Priced by other methods (1)        -           -           1,183             1,183          Total   $    680      $    76,750      $    4,546        $    81,976                                                        Percent of total       1%         93%         6%           100%              (1)     Represents primarily securities for which pricing models were used to compute fair value.      For more information about the valuation of our financial instruments carried at fair value, see “Part II – Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Introduction – Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Investments – Investment Valuation” in our 2011 Form 10-K and Note 12.   As of March 31, 2012, we evaluated the markets that our securities trade in and concluded that none were inactive. We will continue to re-evaluate this conclusion, as needed, based on market conditions. We use unobservable inputs to measure the fair value of securities trading in less liquid or illiquid markets with limited or no pricing information. We obtain broker quotes for securities such as synthetic convertibles, index-linked certificates of deposit and collateralized debt obligations (“CDOs”) when sufficient security structure or other market information is not available to produce an evaluation. For broker-quoted only securities, non-binding quotes from market makers or broker-dealers are obtained from sources recognized as market participants. Broker-quoted securities are based solely on receipt of updated quotes from a single market maker or a broker-dealer recognized as a market participant. Our broker-quoted only securities are generally classified as Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. As of March 31, 2012, we used broker quotes for 89 securities as our final price source, representing less than 2% of total securities owned.            43             Derivatives   Our accounting policies for derivatives and the potential effect on interest spreads in a falling rate environment are discussed in Note 5 of this report and “Part II – Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” in our 2011 Form 10-K.   Guaranteed Living Benefits   Approximately 48% of our variable annuity account values contained a guaranteed withdrawal benefit (“GWB”) rider as of March 31, 2012. Declines in the equity markets increase our exposure to potential benefits under the GWB contracts, leading to an increase in our existing liability for those benefits. For example, a GWB contract is “in the money” if the contract holder’s account balance falls below the guaranteed amount. As of March 31, 2012 and 2011, 39% and 29%, respectively, of all GWB in-force contracts were “in the money,” and our exposure to the guaranteed amounts, after reinsurance, as of March 31, 2012 and 2011, was $1.0 billion and $796 million, respectively. Our exposure before reinsurance for these same periods was $1.1 billion and $911 million, respectively. However, the only way the GWB contract holder can monetize the excess of the guaranteed amount over the account value of the contract is upon death or through a series of withdrawals that do not exceed a specific percentage per year of the guaranteed amount. If, after the series of withdrawals, the account value is exhausted, the contract holder will receive a series of annuity payments equal to the remaining guaranteed amount, and, for our lifetime GWB products, the annuity payments can continue beyond the guaranteed amount. The account value can also fluctuate with equity market returns on a daily basis resulting in increases or decreases in the excess of the guaranteed amount over account value.   For information on our variable annuity hedge program performance, see our discussion in “Realized Gain (Loss) and Benefit Ratio Unlocking – Variable Annuity Net Derivatives Results” below.   Acquisitions and Dispositions   The loss from discontinued operations for the three months ended March 31, 2012, related to a purchase price adjustment associated with the termination of a portion of the investment advisory agreement with Delaware Management Holdings, Inc., our former subsidiary.   For information about acquisitions and divestitures, see “Part II – Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Acquisitions and Dispositions” and Note 3 in our 2011 Form 10-K.            44             RESULTS OF CONSOLIDATED OPERATIONS   Details underlying the consolidated results, deposits, net flows and account values (in millions) were as follows:           For the Three                Months Ended                March 31,                2012     2011     Change      Net Income (Loss)                      Income (loss) from operations:                       Annuities  $ 137   $ 144     -5%      Retirement Plan Services    35     48     -27%      Life Insurance    142     142     0%      Group Protection    16     24     -33%      Other Operations    (34 )   (35 )   3%     Excluded realized gain (loss), after-tax    (73 )   (14 )  NM      Benefit ratio unlocking, after-tax    23     5    NM        Income (loss) from continuing operations, after-tax     246     314     -22%       Income (loss) from discontinued operations, after-tax     (1 )   -    NM       Net income (loss)  $ 245   $ 314     -22%               For the Three                Months Ended                March 31,                2012     2011     Change      Deposits                      Annuities  $ 2,480   $ 2,639     -6%     Retirement Plan Services    1,511     1,341     13%     Life Insurance    1,159     1,270     -9%      Total deposits  $ 5,150   $ 5,250     -2%                            Net Flows                      Annuities  $ 293   $ 483     -39%     Retirement Plan Services    212     134     58%     Life Insurance    751     821     -9%      Total net flows  $ 1,256   $ 1,438     -13%               As of March 31,                2012     2011     Change      Account Values                      Annuities  $ 91,668   $ 87,785     4%     Retirement Plan Services    42,020     40,308     4%     Life Insurance    36,008     34,149     5%      Total account values  $ 169,696   $ 162,242     5%                45             Comparison of the Three Months Ended March 31, 2012 to 2011   Net income decreased due primarily to the following:       ·    Narrowing of our credit spreads during 2012 leading to realized losses related to our non-performance risk (“NPR”) on guaranteed living benefit (“GLB”) liabilities;        ·    New money rates averaging below portfolio yields and lower prepayment and bond makewhole premiums driving lower net investment income, partially offset by growth in business and interest crediting rate actions; and        ·    Investments in strategic initiatives related to updating information technology and expanding distribution and support during 2012.      The decrease in net income was partially offset primarily by the following:        ·   Growth in insurance in force;         ·   Positive net flows and more favorable average equity markets driving higher average daily variable account values; and        ·   More favorable tax items recorded in 2012 than in 2011 driven by tax preferred investments and other items.      RESULTS OF ANNUITIES   Income (Loss) from Operations   Details underlying the results for Annuities (in millions) were as follows:         For the Three              Months Ended              March 31,              2012     2011     Change      Operating Revenues                      Insurance premiums (1)  $ 17   $ 23     -26%     Insurance fees    325     310     5%     Net investment income    272     288     -6%     Operating realized gain (loss)    27     23     17%     Other revenues and fees (2)    90     89     1%      Total operating revenues    731     733     0%     Operating Expenses                      Interest credited    171     174     -2%     Benefits    45     35     29%      Underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses     353     340     4%      Total operating expenses    569     549     4%      Income (loss) from operations before taxes     162     184     -12%     Federal income tax expense (benefit)    25     40     -38%      Income (loss) from operations  $ 137   $ 144     -5%           (1)     Includes primarily our single-premium immediate annuities (“SPIA”), which have a corresponding offset in benefits for changes in reserves.        (2)     Consists primarily of fees attributable to broker-dealer services that are subject to market volatility.      Comparison of the Three Months Ended March 31, 2012 to 2011   Income from operations for this segment decreased due primarily to the following:       ·    Higher benefits attributable to unfavorable mortality experience on SPIA during 2012 as compared to favorable experience during 2011;        ·    Lower net investment income and relatively flat interest credited driven by:             46                     §    Lower prepayment and bond makewhole premiums (See “Consolidated Investments – Commercial Mortgage Loan Prepayment and Bond Makewhole Premiums” below for more information); and        §    New money rates averaging below our portfolio yields;    partially offset by:     §    Positive net flows, and actions implemented to reduce interest crediting rates; and        ·    Higher underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses due to higher trail commissions and investments in strategic initiatives related to updating information technology and expanding distribution and support during 2012.      The decrease in income from operations was partially offset primarily by the following:       ·    Higher insurance fees attributable to more favorable average equity markets driving higher average daily variable account values; and        ·    More favorable tax items recorded in 2012 than in 2011 driven by tax preferred investments and other items.      Additional Information   New deposits are an important component of net flows and key to our efforts to grow our business. Although deposits do not significantly affect current period income from operations, they are an important indicator of future profitability.   The other component of net flows relates to the retention of the business. An important measure of retention is the lapse rate, which compares the amount of withdrawals to the average account values. The overall lapse rate for our annuity products was 8% for the first quarter of 2012 and 2011.   Our fixed annuity business includes products with discretionary crediting rates that are reset on an annual basis and are not subject to surrender charges. Our ability to retain annual reset annuities will be subject to current competitive conditions at the time interest rates for these products reset. We expect to manage the effects of spreads on near-term income from operations through portfolio management and, to a lesser extent, crediting rate actions, which assumes no significant changes in net flows into or out of our fixed accounts or other changes that may cause interest rate spreads to differ from our expectations. For information on interest rate spreads, see “Part I – Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – Interest Rate Risk – Interest Rate Risk on Fixed Insurance Businesses – Falling Rates” herein. For information on the interest rate risk due to falling interest rates, see “Part II – Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – Interest Rate Risk – Interest Rate Risk on Fixed Insurance Businesses – Falling Rates” and “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors – Market Conditions – Changes in interest rates and sustained low interest rates may cause interest rate spreads to decrease and changes in interest rates may also result in increased contract withdrawals” in our 2011 Form 10-K.   We provide information about this segment’s operating revenue and operating expense line items, the period in which amounts are recognized, key drivers of changes and historical details underlying the line items and their associated drivers below. For detail on the operating realized gain (loss), see “Realized Gain (Loss) and Benefit Ratio Unlocking” below.

These assessments are a function of the rates priced into the product and the average daily variable account values. Average daily account values are driven by net flows and the equity markets. In addition, for our fixed annuity contracts and for some variable contracts, we collect surrender charges when contract holders surrender their contracts during their surrender charge periods to protect us from premature withdrawals. Insurance fees include charges on both our variable and fixed annuity products, but exclude the attributed fees on our GLB products; see “Realized Gain (Loss) and Benefit Ratio Unlocking – Operating Realized Gain (Loss)” below for discussion of these attributed fees.   Net Investment Income and Interest Credited   Details underlying net investment income, interest credited (in millions) and our interest rate spread were as follows:         For the Three              Months Ended              March 31,              2012     2011     Change      Net Investment Income                      Fixed maturity securities, mortgage loans on real estate and other, net of investment expenses  $ 240   $ 248     -3%     Commercial mortgage loan prepayment and bond makewhole premiums (1)    2     12     -83%     Surplus investments (2)    30     28     7%     Total net investment income  $ 272   $ 288     -6%                          Interest Credited                      Amount provided to contract holders  $ 168   $ 171     -2%     DSI deferrals    (9 )   (10 )   10%      Interest credited before DSI amortization     159     161     -1%     DSI amortization, excluding unlocking    12     13     -8%      Total interest credited  $ 171   $ 174     -2%              48                 (1)    See “Consolidated Investments – Commercial Mortgage Loan Prepayment and Bond Makewhole Premiums” below for additional information.

We expect to earn a spread between what we earn on the underlying general account investments supporting the fixed annuity product line, including the fixed portion of variable annuity contracts, and what we credit to our fixed annuity contract holders’ accounts, including the fixed portion of variable annuity contracts. Changes in commercial mortgage loan prepayments and bond makewhole premiums, investment income on alternative investments and surplus investment income can vary significantly from period to period due to a number of factors and, therefore, may contribute to investment income results that are not indicative of the underlying trends.   Benefits   Benefits for this segment include changes in reserves of immediate annuity account values driven by premiums, changes in benefit reserves and our expected costs associated with purchases of derivatives used to hedge our benefit ratio unlocking.            49             Underwriting, Acquisition, Insurance and Other Expenses   Details underlying underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses (in millions) were as follows:         For the Three              Months Ended              March 31,              2012     2011     Change      Underwriting, Acquisition, Insurance                      and Other Expenses                      Commissions:                       Deferrable  $ 110   $ 111     -1%      Non-deferrable    73     66     11%     General and administrative expenses    98     87     13%     Taxes, licenses and fees    8     8     0%      Total expenses incurred, excluding broker-dealer    289     272     6%     DAC deferrals    (124 )   (127 )   2%      Total pre-broker-dealer expenses incurred, excluding amortization, net of interest     165     145     14%      DAC and VOBA amortization, net of interest, excluding unlocking     98     103     -5%     Broker-dealer expenses incurred    90     92     -2%      Total underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses   $ 353   $ 340     4%                          DAC Deferrals                      As a percentage of sales/deposits    5.0%     4.8%             Commissions and other costs that result directly from and are essential to the successful acquisition of new or renewal business are deferred to the extent recoverable and are amortized over the lives of the contracts in relation to EGPs. Certain of our commissions, such as trail commissions that are based on account values, are expensed as incurred rather than deferred and amortized.   Broker-dealer expenses that vary with and are related to sales are expensed as incurred and not deferred and amortized. Fluctuations in these expenses correspond with fluctuations in other revenues and fees.            50             RESULTS OF RETIREMENT PLAN SERVICES   Income (Loss) from Operations   Details underlying the results for Retirement Plan Services (in millions) were as follows:         For the Three              Months Ended            March 31,              2012     2011     Change      Operating Revenues                      Insurance fees  $ 52   $ 55     -5%     Net investment income    197     205     -4%     Other revenues and fees (1)    3     3     0%      Total operating revenues    252     263     -4%     Operating Expenses                      Interest credited    111     108     3%      Underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses     94     86     9%      Total operating expenses    205     194     6%      Income (loss) from operations before taxes     47     69     -32%     Federal income tax expense (benefit)    12     21     -43%      Income (loss) from operations  $ 35   $ 48     -27%           (1)     Consists primarily of mutual fund account program fees for mid to large employers.      Comparison of the Three Months Ended March 31, 2012 to 2011   Income from operations for this segment decreased due primarily to the following:       ·    Lower net investment income and relatively flat interest credited driven by:        §    Lower prepayment and bond makewhole premiums (see “Consolidated Investments – Commercial Mortgage Loan Prepayment and Bond Makewhole Premiums” below for more information); and        §    New money rates averaging below our portfolio yields;    partially offset by:     §    Transfers from variable to fixed, and actions implemented to reduce interest crediting rates; and        ·    Higher underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses due to investments in strategic initiatives related to updating information technology and expanding distribution and support during 2012.      Additional Information   Net flows in this business fluctuate based on the timing of larger plans rolling onto our platform and rolling off over the course of the year, and we expect this trend will continue during 2012.   New deposits are an important component of net flows and key to our efforts to grow our business. Although deposits do not significantly affect current period income from operations, they are an important indicator of future profitability. The other component of net flows relates to the retention of the business. An important measure of retention is the lapse rate, which compares the amount of withdrawals to the average account values. The overall lapse rate for our annuity and mutual fund products was 13% for the first quarter of 2012 compared to 12% for the corresponding period in 2011.    Our lapse rate is negatively affected by the continued net outflows from our oldest blocks of annuities business (as presented on our Account Value Roll Forward table below as “Total Multi-Fund® and Other Variable Annuities”), which are also our higher margin product lines in this segment, due to the fact that they are mature blocks with much of the account values out of their surrender charge period. The proportion of these products to our total account values was 39% and 41% as of March 31, 2012, and 2011, respectively. Due to this expected overall shift in business mix toward products with lower returns, a significant increase in new deposit production will be necessary to maintain earnings at current levels.          51               Our fixed annuity business includes products with discretionary and index-based crediting rates that are reset on a quarterly basis. Our ability to retain quarterly reset annuities will be subject to current competitive conditions at the time interest rates for these products reset. We expect to manage the effects of spreads on near-term income from operations through portfolio management and, to a lesser extent, crediting rate actions, which assumes no significant changes in net flows into or out of our fixed accounts or other changes that may cause interest rate spreads to differ from our expectations. For information on interest rate spreads, see “Part I – Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – Interest Rate Risk – Interest Rate Risk on Fixed Insurance Businesses – Falling Rates” herein. For information on the interest rate risk due to falling interest rates, see “Part II – Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – Interest Rate Risk – Interest Rate Risk on Fixed Insurance Businesses – Falling Rates” and “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors – Market Conditions – Changes in interest rates and sustained low interest rates may cause interest rate spreads to decrease and changes in interest rates may also result in increased contract withdrawals” in our 2011 Form 10-K.

Benefits   Benefits for this segment include changes in benefit reserves and our expected costs associated with purchases of derivatives used to hedge our benefit ratio unlocking.            55             Underwriting, Acquisition, Insurance and Other Expenses   Details underlying underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses (in millions) were as follows:           For the Three                Months Ended                March 31,                2012     2011     Change      Underwriting, Acquisition, Insurance and Other Expenses                      Commissions:                       Deferrable  $ 5   $ 5     0%      Non-deferrable    13     12     8%     General and administrative expenses    71     63     13%     Taxes, licenses and fees    5     5     0%      Total expenses incurred    94     85     11%     DAC deferrals    (10 )   (8 )   -25%      Total expenses recognized before amortization    84     77     9%      DAC and VOBA amortization, net of interest, excluding unlocking     10     9     11%      Total underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses   $ 94   $ 86     9%                            DAC Deferrals                      As a percentage of annuity sales/deposits    1.2%     1.1%             Commissions and other costs that result directly from and are essential to the successful acquisition of new or renewal business are deferred to the extent recoverable and are amortized over the lives of the contracts in relation to EGPs. Certain of our commissions, such as trail commissions that are based on account values, are expensed as incurred rather than deferred and amortized. We do not pay commissions on sales of our mutual fund products, and distribution expenses associated with the sale of these mutual fund products are expensed as incurred.            56             RESULTS OF LIFE INSURANCE   Income (Loss) from Operations   Details underlying the results for Life Insurance (in millions) were as follows:           For the Three                Months Ended                March 31,                2012     2011     Change      Operating Revenues                      Insurance premiums  $ 109   $ 108     1%     Insurance fees    529     452     17%     Net investment income    588     579     2%     Other revenues and fees    6     7     -14%      Total operating revenues    1,232     1,146     8%     Operating Expenses                      Interest credited    311     302     3%     Benefits    475     447     6%      Underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses     239     187     28%      Total operating expenses    1,025     936     10%      Income (loss) from operations before taxes     207     210     -1%     Federal income tax expense (benefit)    65     68     -4%      Income (loss) from operations  $ 142   $ 142     0%       Comparison of the Three Months Ended March 31, 2012 to 2011   Income from operations for this segment remained flat due primarily to the following:       ·    Higher insurance fees due to growth in insurance in force; and        ·    Higher net investment income and higher interest credited driven by growth in business in force offset by new money rates averaging below our portfolio yields;    entirely offset by:     ·    Higher underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses attributable to the effect of prospective unlocking during 2012 as compared to 2011; and        ·    Higher benefits attributable to higher death claims and surrender benefits and continued growth in our secondary guarantee life insurance business.      Strategies to Address Statutory Reserve Strain   Our insurance subsidiaries have statutory surplus and risk-based capital (“RBC”) levels above current regulatory required levels. Products containing secondary guarantees require reserves calculated under AG38. Our insurance subsidiaries are employing strategies to reduce the strain of increasing AG38 and Valuation of Life Insurance Policies Model Regulation (“XXX”) statutory reserves associated with secondary guarantee UL and term products. As discussed below, we have been successful in executing reinsurance solutions to release capital to Other Operations. We expect to regularly execute transactions designed to release capital as we continue to sell products that are subject to these reserving requirements. We also plan to refinance prior transactions with long-term structured solutions.   Included in the letters of credit (“LOCs”) issued as of March 31, 2012, was approximately $1.9 billion of long-dated LOCs issued to support inter-company reinsurance arrangements, of which approximately $100 million and $1.0 billion was issued for UL business with secondary guarantees through 2015 and 2031, respectively, and approximately $800 million was issued for term business through 2023. We have also used the proceeds from senior note issuances of approximately $1.1 billion to execute long-term structured solutions supporting secondary guarantee UL and term business. LOCs and related capital market alternatives lower the capital effect of secondary guarantee UL products. An inability to obtain the necessary LOC capacity or other capital          57             market alternatives could affect our returns on our in-force secondary guarantee UL business. However, we believe that our insurance subsidiaries have sufficient capital to support the increase in statutory reserves, based on our current reserve projections, if such structures are not available. See “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors – Legislative, Regulatory and Tax – Changes to the calculation of reserves and attempts to mitigate the impact of Regulation XXX and Actuarial Guideline 38 may fail in whole or in part resulting in an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations” in our 2011 Form 10-K for further information on XXX and AG38 reserves. See the table in “Underwriting, Acquisition, Insurance and Other Expenses” below for the presentation of our expenses associated with reserve financing.   Additional Information   We expect to manage the effects of spreads on near-term income from operations through portfolio management, which assumes no significant changes in net flows into or out of our fixed accounts or other changes that may cause interest rate spreads to differ from our expectations.   For information on interest rate spreads, see “Part I – Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – Interest Rate Risk – Interest Rate Risk on Fixed Insurance Businesses – Falling Rates” herein. For information on the interest rate risk due to falling interest rates, see “Part II – Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – Interest Rate Risk – Interest Rate Risk on Fixed Insurance Businesses – Falling Rates” and “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors – Market Conditions – Changes in interest rates and sustained low interest rates may cause interest rate spreads to decrease and changes in interest rates may also result in increased contract withdrawals” in our 2011 Form 10-K.   Sales are not recorded as a component of revenues (other than for traditional products) and do not have a significant effect on current quarter income from operations but are indicators of future profitability. Generally, we have higher sales during the second half of the year with the fourth quarter being our strongest. However, we face conditions in the marketplace as discussed in “Introduction – Executive Summary – Current Market Conditions” above that may challenge our sales volume for the remainder of 2012. For example, we are implementing pricing changes to our products that reflect the current low interest rate environment that we believe will lower our sales volumes and could potentially reduce our market share until competitive conditions change.   We provide information about this segment’s operating revenue and operating expense line items, the period in which amounts are recognized, key drivers of changes and historical details underlying the line items and their associated drivers below.   For factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in this section, see “Forward-Looking Statements – Cautionary Language” above and “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2011 Form 10-K.   Insurance Premiums   Insurance premiums relate to traditional products and are a function of the rates priced into the product and the level of insurance in force. Insurance in force, in turn, is driven by sales, persistency and mortality experience.            58             Insurance Fees   Details underlying insurance fees, sales, net flows, account values and in-force face amount (in millions) were as follows:           For the Three                Months Ended                March 31,                2012     2011     Change      Insurance Fees                      Mortality assessments  $ 337   $ 325     4%     Expense assessments    207     230     -10%     Surrender charges    23     23     0%     DFEL:                       Deferrals    (83 )   (126 )   34%      Amortization, net of interest:                        Prospective unlocking - assumption changes     -     (2 )   100%       Prospective unlocking - model refinements     (6 )   (18 )   67%       Amortization, net of interest, excluding unlocking     51     20     155%      Total insurance fees  $ 529   $ 452     17%               For the Three                Months Ended                March 31,                2012     2011     Change      Sales by Product                      UL:                       Excluding MoneyGuard®  $ 47   $ 85     -45%      MoneyGuard®    41     34     21%      Total UL    88     119     -26%     VUL    10     10     0%     COLI and BOLI    11     17     -35%     Term    13     13     0%      Total sales  $ 122   $ 159     -23%                            Net Flows                      Deposits  $ 1,159   $ 1,270     -9%     Withdrawals and deaths    (408 )   (449 )   9%      Net flows  $ 751   $ 821     -9%                            Contract holder assessments  $ 805   $ 806     0%                59                       As of March 31,                2012     2011     Change      Account Values                      UL  $ 28,341   $ 26,585     7%     VUL    5,376     5,294     2%     Interest-sensitive whole life    2,291     2,270     1%      Total account values  $ 36,008   $ 34,149     5%                            In-Force Face Amount                      UL and other  $ 307,957   $ 299,920     3%     Term insurance    272,006     266,764     2%      Total in-force face amount  $ 579,963   $ 566,684     2%       Insurance fees relate only to interest-sensitive products and include mortality assessments, expense assessments (net of deferrals and amortization related to DFEL) and surrender charges. Mortality and expense assessments are deducted from our contract holders’ account values. These amounts are a function of the rates priced into the product and premiums received, face amount in force and account values. Insurance in force, in turn, is driven by sales, persistency and mortality experience. In-force growth should be considered independently with respect to term products versus UL and other products, as term products have a lower profitability relative to face amount compared to interest-sensitive and other products.   Sales in the table above and as discussed above were reported as follows:       ·    UL (excluding linked-benefit products) and VUL (including corporate-owned UL and VUL (“COLI”) and bank-owned UL and VUL (“BOLI”)) – first year commissionable premiums plus 5% of excess premiums received, including an adjustment for internal replacements of approximately 50% of commissionable premiums;        ·    MoneyGuard® (our linked-benefit product) – 15% of premium deposits; and        ·    Term – 100% of first year paid premiums.      UL and VUL products with secondary guarantees represented approximately 38% of interest-sensitive life insurance in force as of March 31, 2012, and approximately 33% of sales for the three months ended March 31, 2012, as compared to approximately 50% of sales for the corresponding period in 2011. Changes in the marketplace and product focuses are resulting in a shift in our business mix away from products with secondary guarantees to accumulation products like Indexed UL, VUL and COLI. Actuarial Guideline 37, or Variable Life Reserves for Guaranteed Minimum Death Benefits, and AG38 impose additional statutory reserve requirements for these products.   Net Investment Income and Interest Credited   Details underlying net investment income, interest credited (in millions) and our interest rate spread were as follows:         For the Three              Months Ended              March 31,              2012     2011     Change      Net Investment Income                       Fixed maturity securities, mortgage loans on real estate and other, net of investment expenses   $ 540   $ 517     4%      Commercial mortgage loan prepayment and bond makewhole premiums (1)     2     4     -50%     Alternative investments (2)    15     25     -40%     Surplus investments (3)    31     33     -6%      Total net investment income  $ 588   $ 579     2%                          Interest Credited  $ 311   $ 302     3%                60                   (1)    See “Consolidated Investments – Commercial Mortgage Loan Prepayment and Bond Makewhole Premiums” below for additional information.

Invested assets will typically grow at a faster rate than account values because of the AG38 reserve requirements, which cause statutory reserves to grow at a faster rate than account values. Invested assets are based upon the statutory reserve liabilities and are, therefore, affected by various reserve adjustments, including capital transactions providing relief from AG38 reserve requirements, which leads to a transfer of invested assets from this segment to Other Operations for use in other corporate purposes. We expect to earn a spread          61             between what we earn on the underlying general account investments and what we credit to our contract holders’ accounts. We use our investment income to offset the earnings effect of the associated build of our policy reserves for traditional products. Commercial mortgage loan prepayments and bond makewhole premiums and investment income on alternative investments can vary significantly from period to period due to a number of factors, and, therefore, may contribute to investment income results that are not indicative of the underlying trends.

In addition, benefits includes the change in secondary guarantee life insurance product reserves. The reserve for secondary guarantees is affected by changes in expected future trends of expense assessments causing prospective unlocking adjustments to this liability similar to DAC, VOBA and DFEL.             62             Underwriting, Acquisition, Insurance and Other Expenses   Details underlying underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses (in millions) were as follows:             For the Three                  Months Ended                  March 31,                  2012     2011     Change      Underwriting, Acquisition, Insurance and Other Expenses                        Commissions    $ 130   $ 173     -25%     General and administrative expenses      123     112     10%      Expenses associated with reserve financing       16     14     14%     Taxes, licenses and fees      34     36     -6%      Total expenses incurred      303     335     -10%     DAC and VOBA deferrals      (145 )   (194 )   25%       Total expenses recognized before amortization       158     141     12%      DAC and VOBA amortization, net of interest:                           Prospective unlocking - assumption changes       -     (7 )   100%       Prospective unlocking - model refinements       (33 )   (68 )   51%       Amortization, net of interest, excluding unlocking       113     120     -6%     Other intangible amortization      1     1     0%       Total underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses     $ 239   $ 187     28%                              DAC and VOBA Deferrals                        As a percentage of sales      118.9%     122.0%             Commissions and costs that result directly from and are essential to successful acquisition of new or renewal business are deferred to the extent recoverable and for our interest-sensitive products are generally amortized over the lives of the contracts in relation to EGPs.

The decrease in income from operations was partially offset primarily by growth in insurance premiums driven by normal, organic business growth in our non-medical products.            64             Additional Information   Management compares trends in actual loss ratios to pricing expectations because group-underwriting risks change over time. We expect normal fluctuations in our composite non-medical loss ratios of this segment, as claims experience is inherently uncertain. Non-medical loss ratios in general are likely to remain within our long-term expectation of 71% to 74% during 2012. For every one percent increase in the loss ratio above our expectation, we would expect an approximate annual $10 million to $12 million decrease to income from operations.   We are evaluating the potential effects that health care reform may have on the value and profitability of this segment’s products and income from operations, including, but not limited to, potential changes to traditional sources of income for our brokers who may seek additional portfolio options and/or modification to compensation structures.   For information on the effects of current interest rates on our long-term disability claim reserves, see “Part II – Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – Interest Rate Risk – Interest Rate Risk on Fixed Insurance Businesses – Falling Rates” in our 2011 Form 10-K.   Sales relate to long-duration contracts sold to new contract holders and new programs sold to existing contract holders. We believe that the trend in sales is an important indicator of development of business in force over time.   We provide information about this segment’s operating revenue and operating expense line items, the period in which amounts are recognized, key drivers of changes and historical details underlying the line items and their associated drivers below.

Insurance Premiums   Details underlying insurance premiums (in millions) were as follows:           For the Three                Months Ended                March 31,                2012     2011     Change      Insurance Premiums by Product Line                      Life  $ 186   $ 171     9%     Disability    199     186     7%     Dental    46     46     0%      Total non-medical    431     403     7%     Medical    32     34     -6%      Total insurance premiums  $ 463   $ 437     6%                            Sales  $ 67   $ 45     49%       Our cost of insurance and policy administration charges are embedded in the premiums charged to our customers. The premiums are a function of the rates priced into the product and our business in force. Business in force, in turn, is driven by sales and persistency experience. Sales in the table above are the combined annualized premiums for our life, disability and dental products.   Net Investment Income   We use our investment income to offset the earnings effect of the associated build of our policy reserves, which are a function of our insurance premiums and the yields on our invested assets.            65             Benefits and Interest Credited   Details underlying benefits and interest credited (in millions) and loss ratios by product line were as follows:           For the Three                Months Ended                March 31,                2012     2011     Change      Benefits and Interest Credited by Product Line                      Life  $ 146   $ 129     13%     Disability    139     131     6%     Dental    38     39     -3%      Total non-medical    323     299     8%     Medical    28     29     -3%      Total benefits and interest credited  $ 351   $ 328     7%                            Loss Ratios by Product Line                      Life    78.2 %   75.9 %         Disability    70.1 %   70.1 %         Dental    82.1 %   83.7 %          Total non-medical    74.9 %   74.1 %         Medical    87.6 %   86.1 %           Underwriting, Acquisition, Insurance and Other Expenses   Details underlying underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses (in millions) were as follows:           For the Three                Months Ended                March 31,                2012     2011     Change      Underwriting, Acquisition, Insurance and Other Expenses                      Commissions  $ 54   $ 50     8%     General and administrative expenses    61     51     20%     Taxes, licenses and fees    12     11     9%      Total expenses incurred    127     112     13%     DAC deferrals    (11 )   (9 )   -22%       Total expenses recognized before amortization     116     103     13%      DAC and VOBA amortization, net of interest     12     10     20%       Total underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses   $ 128   $ 113     13%                            DAC Deferrals                      As a percentage of insurance premiums    2.4%     2.1%             Expenses, excluding broker commissions, that result directly from and are essential to the successful acquisition of new or renewal business are deferred to the extent recoverable and are amortized on either a straight-line basis or as a level percent of premium of the related contracts depending on the block of business. Broker commissions, which vary with and are related to paid premiums, are expensed as incurred. The level of expenses is an important driver of profitability for this segment as group insurance contracts are offered within an environment that competes on the basis of price and service.          66               RESULTS OF OTHER OPERATIONS   Income (Loss) from Operations   Details underlying the results for Other Operations (in millions) were as follows:           For the Three                Months Ended                March 31,                2012     2011     Change      Operating Revenues                      Net investment income  $ 70   $ 80     -13%      Amortization of deferred gain on business sold through reinsurance     18     18     0%     Media revenues (net)    17     16     6%     Other revenues and fees    2     4     -50%      Total operating revenues    107     118     -9%     Operating Expenses                      Interest credited    31     29     7%     Benefits    28     32     -13%     Media expenses    16     17     -6%     Other expenses    21     25     -16%     Interest and debt expense    68     72     -6%      Total operating expenses    164     175     -6%      Income (loss) from operations before taxes     (57 )   (57 )   0%     Federal income tax expense (benefit)    (23 )   (22 )   -5%      Income (loss) from operations  $ (34 ) $ (35 )   3%       Comparison of the Three Months Ended March 31, 2012 to 2011   Loss from operations for Other Operations decreased due primarily to the following:       ·    Lower other expenses due to higher legal expenses during the first quarter of 2011; and        ·    Lower interest and debt expense attributable to lower average balances of and a decline in the rate on outstanding debt during 2012.      The decrease in loss from operations was partially offset primarily by lower net investment income, net of interest credited, attributable to the following:       ·    Repurchases of common stock, net cash used in operating activities due to interest payments and transfers to other segments for other-than-temporary impairment (“OTTI”), partially offset by distributable earnings received from our insurance segments, resulting in lower average invested assets; and        ·    New money rates averaging below our portfolio yields.      Additional Information   We provide information about Other Operations’ operating revenue and operating expense line items, the period in which amounts are recognized, key drivers of changes and historical details underlying the line items and their associated drivers below.   For factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in this section, see “Forward-Looking Statements – Cautionary Language” above and “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2011 Form 10-K.            67             Net Investment Income and Interest Credited   We utilize an internal formula to determine the amount of capital that is allocated to our business segments. Investment income on capital in excess of the calculated amounts is reported in Other Operations. If regulations require increases in our insurance segments’ statutory reserves and surplus, the amount of capital retained by Other Operations would decrease and net investment income would be negatively affected.   Write-downs for OTTI decrease the recorded value of our invested assets owned by our business segments. These write-downs are not included in the income from operations of our operating segments. When impairment occurs, assets are transferred to the business segments’ portfolios and will reduce the future net investment income for Other Operations, but should not have an effect on a consolidated basis unless the impairments are related to defaulted securities. Statutory reserve adjustments for our business segments can also cause allocations of invested assets between the affected segments and Other Operations.   The majority of our interest credited relates to our reinsurance operations sold to Swiss Re in 2001. A substantial amount of the business was sold through indemnity reinsurance transactions, which is still recorded in our consolidated financial statements. The interest credited corresponds to investment income earnings on the assets we continue to hold for this business. There is no effect to income or loss in Other Operations or on a consolidated basis for these amounts because interest earned on the blocks that continue to be reinsured is passed through to Swiss Re in the form of interest credited.   Benefits   Benefits are recognized when incurred for Institutional Pension products and disability income business.   Other Expenses   Details underlying other expenses (in millions) were as follows:         For the Three              Months Ended              March 31,              2012     2011     Change      Other Expenses                      General and administrative expenses:                       Legal  $ 1   $ 8     -88%      Branding    9     5     80%      Other (1)    13     13     0%       Total general and administrative expenses     23     26     -12%     Taxes, licenses and fees     1     1     0%      Inter-segment reimbursement associated with reserve financing and LOC expenses (2)     (3 )   (2 )   -50%      Total other expenses  $ 21   $ 25     -16%           (1)    Includes expenses that are corporate in nature including charitable contributions, amortization of media intangible assets with a definite life, other expenses not allocated to our business segments and inter-segment expense eliminations.        (2)    Consists of reimbursements to Other Operations from the Life Insurance segment for the use of proceeds from certain issuances of senior notes that were used as long-term structured solutions, net of expenses incurred by Other Operations for its use of LOCs.      Interest and Debt Expense   Our current level of interest expense may not be indicative of the future due to, among other things, the timing of the use of cash, the availability of funds from our inter-company cash management program and the future cost of capital.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.”   Comparison of the Three Months Ended March 31, 2012 to 2011   We had realized losses in the first quarter of 2012 as compared to gains for the corresponding period of 2011 due primarily to the following:       ·    Higher losses on variable annuity net derivatives results attributable to:        §    Narrowing of our credit spreads during the first quarter of 2012 resulting in an unfavorable GLB NPR component (see “Variable Annuity Net Derivatives Results” below for a discussion of how our NPR adjustment is determined);    partially offset by:          69                   §    Less volatile capital markets during the first quarter of 2012 resulting in more favorable hedge program performance; and        ·    Higher gross realized gains during the first quarter of 2011 originating from asset sales to reposition the portfolio (see “Consolidated Investments – Realized Gain (Loss) Related to Certain Investments” below for more information).      The realized losses in the first quarter of 2012 were partially offset by higher gains on the mark-to-market on certain instruments attributable to spreads narrowing on corporate credit default swaps, partially offset by increases in interest rates leading to a decrease in the value of our trading securities.   Operating Realized Gain (Loss)   See “Realized Gain (Loss) and Benefit Ratio Unlocking – Operating Realized Gain (Loss)” in our 2011 Form 10-K for a discussion of our operating realized gain (loss).

Variable Annuity Net Derivatives Results   See “Realized Gain (Loss) and Benefit Ratio Unlocking – Variable Annuity Net Derivatives Results” in our 2011 Form 10-K for a discussion of our variable annuity net derivatives results.   As of March 31, 2012, the net effect of the NPR resulted in a $29 million decrease in the liability for our GLB embedded derivative reserves.   Details underlying the NPR component and associated effect to our GLB embedded derivative reserves (dollars in millions) were as follows:           As of     As of     As of     As of     As of          March 31,    December 31,   September 30,   June 30,   March 31,         2012     2011     2011     2011     2011      10-year CDS spread    2.40%     3.65%     4.42%     2.02%     1.78%     NPR factor related to 10-year CDS spread    0.25%     0.43%     0.51%     0.24%     0.17%     Unadjusted embedded derivative liability  $ 1,083   $ 2,418     2,642     306   $ 112       Estimating what the absolute amount of the NPR effect will be period to period is difficult due to the utilization of all cash flows and the shape of the spread curve. Currently, we estimate that if the NPR factors as of March 31, 2012, were to have been zero along all points on the spread curve, then the NPR offset to the unadjusted liability would have resulted in an unfavorable effect to net income of approximately $150 million, pre-DAC and pre-tax. Under this scenario, the effect of the NPR would result in an increase rather than a decrease to the unadjusted embedded derivative liability. Alternatively, if the NPR factors were 20 basis points higher along all points on the spread curve as of March 31, 2012, then there would have been a favorable effect to net income of approximately $85 million, pre-DAC and pre-tax. In the preceding two sentences, “DAC” refers to the associated amortization of DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL. Changing market conditions could cause this relationship to deviate significantly in future periods. Sensitivity within this range is primarily a result of volatility in our credit default swap (“CDS”) spreads and the slope of the CDS spread term structure.

We follow a balanced approach to investing for both current income and prudent risk management, with an emphasis on generating sufficient current income, net of income tax, to meet our obligations to customers, as well as other general liabilities. This balanced approach requires the evaluation of expected return and risk of each asset class utilized, while still meeting our income objectives. This approach is important to our asset-liability management because decisions can be made based upon both the economic and current investment income considerations affecting assets and liabilities. For a discussion on our risk management process, see “Part II – Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” in our 2011 Form 10-K.   Investment Portfolio Composition and Diversification   Fundamental to our investment policy is diversification across asset classes. Our investment portfolio, excluding cash and invested cash, is composed of fixed maturity securities, mortgage loans on real estate, real estate (either wholly-owned or in joint ventures) and other long-term investments. We purchase investments for our segmented portfolios that have yield, duration and other characteristics that take into account the liabilities of the products being supported.   We have the ability to maintain our investment holdings throughout credit cycles because of our capital position, the long-term nature of our liabilities and the matching of our portfolios of investment assets with the liabilities of our various products.   Fixed Maturity and Equity Securities Portfolios   Fixed maturity securities and equity securities consist of portfolios classified as AFS and trading. Mortgage-backed and private securities are included in both of the AFS and trading portfolios.   Details underlying our fixed maturity and equity securities portfolios by industry classification (in millions) are presented in the tables below. These tables agree in total with the presentation of AFS securities in Note 4; however, the categories below represent a more detailed breakout of the AFS portfolio. Therefore, the investment classifications listed below do not agree to the investment categories provided in Note 4.          71                     As of March 31, 2012              Gross Unrealized           %        Amortized           Losses     Fair     Fair        Cost     Gains     and OTTI     Value     Value      Fixed Maturity AFS Securities                                  Industry corporate bonds:                                   Financial services  $ 8,912   $ 700   $ 101   $ 9,511     12.3%      Basic industry    3,545     315     20     3,840     5.0%      Capital goods    4,146     424     27     4,543     5.9%      Communications    3,388     388     29     3,747     4.9%      Consumer cyclical    3,287     333     29     3,591     4.7%      Consumer non-cyclical    8,227     1,083     2     9,308     12.1%      Energy    5,194     639     9     5,824     7.6%      Technology    1,869     173     8     2,034     2.6%      Transportation    1,413     148     2     1,559     2.0%      Industrial other    887     71     1     957     1.2%      Utilities    10,857     1,282     30     12,109     15.7%     Collateralized mortgage and other obligations ("CMOs"):                                   Agency backed    3,005     340     -

Such related balance sheet effects include adjustments to the balances of DAC, VOBA, DFEL, other contract holder funds and deferred income taxes. Adjustments to each of these balances are charged or credited to AOCI. For instance, DAC is adjusted upon the recognition of unrealized gains or losses because the amortization of DAC is based upon an assumed emergence of gross profits on certain insurance business. Deferred income tax balances are also adjusted because unrealized gains or losses do not affect actual taxes currently paid.

For securities where the ratings assigned by the major credit agencies are not equivalent, the second highest rating assigned is used. For those securities where ratings by the major credit rating agencies are not available, which does not represent a significant amount of our total fixed maturity AFS securities, we base the ratings disclosed upon internal ratings.         Comparisons between the NAIC ratings and rating agency designations are published by the NAIC. The NAIC assigns securities quality ratings and uniform valuations, which are used by insurers when preparing their annual statements. The NAIC ratings are similar to the rating agency designations of the Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations for marketable bonds. NAIC ratings 1 and 2 include bonds generally considered investment grade (rated Baa3 or higher by Moody’s, or rated BBB- or higher by S&P and Fitch), by such ratings organizations. However, securities rated NAIC 1 and NAIC 2 could be deemed below investment grade by the rating agencies as a result of the current RBC rules for residential mortgage-backed securities (“RMBS”) and CMBS for statutory reporting. NAIC ratings 3 through 6 include bonds generally considered below investment grade (rated Ba1 or lower by Moody’s, or rated BB+ or lower by S&P and Fitch).     We have identified direct and indirect exposure to select countries in Europe that are currently experiencing stress in the credit markets, notably Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Hungary and Cyprus. These countries were identified due to high credit spreads and political and economic uncertainty in these countries. The exposure was determined by country of domicile, provided that a meaningful portion of revenues is generated from the country of domicile. As of March 31, 2012, we had direct sovereign exposure only to Italy with an amortized cost and fair value of $3 million. We had no exposure to any issuers, sovereign or non-sovereign, located in Greece, Hungary or Cyprus. Our exposure to banks in Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Hungary and Cyprus is limited to two large Spanish banks where our investments are in subsidiaries located outside of Spain with an amortized cost of $63 million and fair value of $64 million.          74                 Our total non-banking and non-sovereign AFS securities exposure to Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain had an amortized cost of $770 million and a fair value of $794 million as of March 31, 2012, of which approximately 50% was related to large multinational companies domiciled in those countries. The detailed breakout by country was as follows (in millions):           Amortized     Fair          Cost     Value      Spain  $ 367   $ 397     Ireland    215     205     Italy    148     160     Portugal    40     32     Total  $ 770   $ 794       We purchased a European subordinated investment grade financial index hedge in the amount of €35 million with a maturity of June 20, 2017, to provide some protection on possible defaults on our European investments.   We manage European and other investment risks through our internal investment department and outside asset managers. The risk management is focused on monitoring spreads, pricing and monitoring of global economic developments. We have incorporated these risks into our stress testing.   As of March 31, 2012, and December 31, 2011, 69.9% and 67.4%, respectively, of the total publicly traded and private securities in an unrealized loss status were rated as investment grade. See Note 4 for maturity date information for our fixed maturity investment portfolio. Our gross unrealized losses on AFS securities as of March 31, 2012, decreased $208 million. As more fully described in Note 1 in our 2011 Form 10-K, we regularly review our investment holdings for OTTI. We believe the unrealized loss position as of March 31, 2012, does not represent OTTI as we do not intend to sell these debt securities, it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the debt securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis, the estimated future cash flows are equal to or greater than the amortized cost basis of the debt securities, or we have the ability and intent to hold the equity securities for a period of time sufficient for recovery. For further information on our unrealized losses on AFS securities see “Composition by Industry Categories of our Unrealized Losses on AFS Securities” below.   Selected information for certain AFS securities in a gross unrealized loss position (dollars in millions) was as follows:           As of March 31, 2012                Gross     Estimated     Estimated                            Unrealized     Years     Average                            Losses     until Call     Years                      Fair     and     or     Until     Subordination Level          Value     OTTI     Maturity     Recovery     Current    Origination     CMBS  $ 249   $ 86    1 to 41    28     24.0%     15.8%    Hybrid and redeemable preferred securities   529     122    1 to 55    31     N/A     N/A        As provided in the table above, many of the securities in these categories are long-dated with some of the preferred securities being perpetual. This is purposeful as it matches the long-term nature of our liabilities associated with our life insurance and annuity products. See “Part II – Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” in our 2011 Form 10-K where we present information related to maturities of securities and the expected cash flows for rate sensitive liabilities and maturities of our holding company debt, which also demonstrates the long-term nature of the cash flows associated with these items. Because of this relationship, we do not believe it will be necessary to sell these securities before they recover or mature. For these securities, the estimated range and average period until recovery is the call or maturity period. It is difficult to predict or project when the securities will recover as it is dependent upon a number of factors including the overall economic climate. We do not believe it is necessary to impair these securities as long as the expected future cash flows are projected to be sufficient to recover the amortized cost of these securities.   The actual range and period until recovery could vary significantly depending on a variety of factors, many of which are out of our control. There are several items that could affect the length of the period until recovery, such as the pace of economic recovery, level of delinquencies, performance of the underlying collateral, changes in market interest rates, exposures to various industry or geographic conditions, market behavior and other market conditions.           75                      We concluded that it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the fixed maturity AFS securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis, that the estimated future cash flows are equal to or greater than the amortized cost basis of the debt securities, and that we have the ability to hold the equity AFS securities for a period of time sufficient for recovery. This conclusion is consistent with our asset-liability management process. Management considers the following as part of the evaluation:         ·    The current economic environment and market conditions;        ·    Our business strategy and current business plans;        ·    The nature and type of security, including expected maturities and exposure to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risk;        ·    Our analysis of data from financial models and other internal and industry sources to evaluate the current effectiveness of our hedging and overall risk management strategies;        ·    The current and expected timing of contractual maturities of our assets and liabilities, expectations of prepayments on investments and expectations for surrenders and withdrawals of life insurance policies and annuity contracts;        ·    The capital risk limits approved by management; and        ·    Our current financial condition and liquidity demands.        To determine the recoverability of a debt security, we consider the facts and circumstances surrounding the underlying issuer including, but not limited to, the following:         ·    Historical and implied volatility of the security;          ·    Length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than amortized cost;        ·    Adverse conditions specifically related to the security or to specific conditions in an industry or geographic area;        ·    Failure, if any, of the issuer of the security to make scheduled payments; and        ·    Recoveries or additional declines in fair value subsequent to the balance sheet date.          As reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, we had $96.4 billion of investments and cash, which exceeded the liabilities for our future obligations under insurance policies and contracts, net of amounts recoverable from reinsurers, which totaled $82.3 billion as of March 31, 2012. If it were necessary to liquidate securities prior to maturity or call to meet cash flow needs, we would first look to those securities that are in an unrealized gain position, which had a fair value of $69.8 billion, excluding consolidated variable interest entities (“VIEs”) in the amount of $702 million, as of March 31, 2012, rather than selling securities in an unrealized loss position. The amount of cash that we have on hand at any point of time takes into account our liquidity needs in the future, other sources of cash, such as the maturities of investments, interest and dividends we earn on our investments and the on-going cash flows from new and existing business.       See “AFS Securities – Evaluation for Recovery of Amortized Cost” in Note 1 in our 2011 Form 10-K and Note 4 for additional discussion.    As of March 31, 2012, and December 31, 2011, the estimated fair value for all private securities was $9.9 billion and $9.3 billion, respectively, representing approximately 11% and 10%, respectively, of total invested assets.    For information regarding our VIEs’ fixed maturity securities, see Note 3 in this report and Note 4 in our 2011 Form 10-K.    Mortgage-Backed Securities (“MBS”) (Included in AFS and Trading Securities)    See “Consolidated Investments – Mortgage-Backed Securities” in our 2011 Form 10-K for a discussion of our MBS.   Our RMBS had a market value of $7.8 billion and an unrealized gain of $390 million, or 5%, as of March 31, 2012.             76              The market value of AFS securities and trading securities backed by subprime loans was $444 million and represented less than 1% of our total investment portfolio as of March 31, 2012. AFS securities represented $430 million, or 97%, and trading securities represented $14 million, or 3%, of the subprime exposure as of March 31, 2012. AFS securities and trading securities rated A or above represented 43% of the subprime investments and $231 million in market value of our subprime investments was backed by loans originating in 2005 and forward. The table below summarizes our investments in AFS securities backed by pools of residential mortgages (in millions):                          As of March 31, 2012                          Prime Agency       Prime/ Non-Agency       Alt-A       Subprime       Total                                                                                     Fair   Amortized   Fair   Amortized   Fair   Amortized   Fair   Amortized   Fair   Amortized                      Value       Cost       Value       Cost       Value       Cost       Value       Cost       Value       Cost        Type                                                                                                                            RMBS   $    6,279        $    5,774        $    832        $    873        $    461        $    549        $    -

The $251 million in trading securities consisted of $227 million prime, $10 million Alt-A and $14 million subprime.        (2)    Does not include the amortized cost of trading securities totaling $241 million, which support our Modco reinsurance agreements because investment results for these agreements are passed directly to the reinsurers. The $241 million in trading securities consisted of $213 million prime, $12 million Alt-A and $16 million subprime.         (3)    Based upon the rating designations determined and provided by the major credit rating agencies (Fitch, Moody’s and S&P). For securities where the ratings assigned by the major credit agencies are not equivalent, the second highest rating assigned is used. For those securities where ratings by the major credit rating agencies are not available, which does not represent a significant amount of our total fixed maturity AFS securities, we base the ratings disclosed upon internal ratings.         None of these investments included any direct investments in subprime lenders or mortgages. We are not aware of material exposure to subprime loans in our alternative asset portfolio.          77                 The following summarizes our investments in AFS securities backed by pools of commercial mortgages (in millions):                            As of March 31, 2012                      Multiple Property       Single Property       CRE CDOs       Total                      Fair       Amortized       Fair       Amortized       Fair       Amortized       Fair       Amortized                      Value       Cost       Value       Cost       Value       Cost       Value       Cost    Type                                                                                                 CMBS   $    1,479        $    1,461        $    44        $    72        $    -        $    -        $    1,523        $    1,533     CRE CDOs        -             -             -             -             21             32             21             32         Total by type (1)(2)   $    1,479        $    1,461        $    44        $    72        $    21        $    32        $    1,544        $    1,565                                                                                                                    Rating                                                                                                AAA   $    968        $    904        $    13        $    13        $    -        $    -        $    981        $    917     AA        203             200             10             10             -             -             213             210     A        132             131             5             6             1             1             138             138     BBB        104             108             5             6             6             7             115             121     BB and below        72             118             11             37             14             24             97             179         Total by rating (1)(2)(3)   $    1,479        $    1,461        $    44        $    72        $    21        $    32        $    1,544        $    1,565                                                                                                                    Origination Year                                                                                                2004 and prior   $    828        $    818        $    22        $    23        $    3        $    4        $    853        $    845     2005         318             301             21             45             6             7             345             353     2006         138             145             1             4             12             21             151             170     2007         139             143             -             -             -             -             139             143     2010         56             54             -             -             -             -             56             54         Total by origination year (1)(2)   $    1,479        $    1,461        $    44        $    72        $    21        $    32        $    1,544        $    1,565                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Total AFS securities backed by pools of commercial mortgages as a percentage of total AFS securities                                                                                2.0%           2.2%          (1)    Does not include the fair value of trading securities totaling $26 million, which support our Modco reinsurance agreements because investment results for these agreements are passed directly to the reinsurers. The $26 million in trading securities consisted of $23 million CMBS and $3 million CRE CDOs.        (2)    Does not include the amortized cost of trading securities totaling $30 million, which support our Modco reinsurance agreements because investment results for these agreements are passed directly to the reinsurers. The $30 million in trading securities consisted of $27 million CMBS and $3 million CRE CDOs.        (3)    Based upon the rating designations determined and provided by the major credit rating agencies (Fitch, Moody’s and S&P). For securities where the ratings assigned by the major credit agencies are not equivalent, the second highest rating assigned is used. For those securities where ratings by the major credit rating agencies are not available, which does not represent a significant amount of our total fixed maturity AFS securities, we base the ratings disclosed upon internal ratings.      As of March 31, 2012, the amortized cost and fair value of our AFS exposure to Monoline insurers was $563 million and $509 million, respectively.   Composition by Industry Categories of our Unrealized Losses on AFS Securities   When considering unrealized gain and loss information, it is important to recognize that the information relates to the status of securities at a particular point in time and may not be indicative of the status of our investment portfolios subsequent to the balance sheet date. Further, because the timing of the recognition of realized investment gains and losses through the selection of which securities are sold is largely at management’s discretion, it is important to consider the information provided below within the context of the overall unrealized gain or loss position of our investment portfolios. These are important considerations that should be included in any evaluation of the potential effect of unrealized loss securities on our future earnings.            78             The composition by industry categories of all securities in unrealized loss status (in millions), was as follows:           As of March 31, 2012                                                            %                                                Gross       Gross                    %                   %       Unrealized       Unrealized        Fair       Fair       Amortized       Amortized       Losses       Losses        Value       Value       Cost       Cost       and OTTI       and OTTI    ABS   $    703        10.7%       $    968        13.0%       $    265        29.4%    Banking        881        13.4%            1,059        14.2%            178        19.8%    CMOs        905        13.8%            1,053        14.1%            148        16.4%    CMBS        249        3.8%            335        4.5%            86        9.5%    Electric        461        7.0%            486        6.5%            25        2.8%    Property and casualty insurers        112        1.7%            136        1.8%            24        2.7%    Diversified manufacturing        228        3.5%            252        3.4%            24        2.7%    Media - non-cable        146        2.2%            168        2.3%            22        2.4%    Retailers        86        1.3%            102        1.4%            16        1.8%    Paper        118        1.8%            132        1.8%            14        1.6%    Local authorities        30        0.5%            41        0.5%            11        1.2%     Industries with unrealized losses less than $10 million         2,642        40.3%            2,730        36.5%            88        9.7%     Total by industry   $    6,561        100.0%       $    7,462        100.0%       $    901        100.0%                                                                  Total by industry as a percentage of total AFS securities        8.5%                   10.6%                   100.0%              As of March 31, 2012, the amortized cost and fair value of securities subject to enhanced analysis and monitoring for potential changes in unrealized loss status was $1.1 billion and $740 million, respectively.

These conditions and the overall economic downturn put pressure on the fundamentals of mortgage loans through rising vacancies, falling rents and falling property values.   See Note 4 for information regarding our loan-to-value and debt-service coverage ratios.    There were 10 and 12 impaired mortgage loans on real estate, or less than 1% and 1% of the total dollar amount of mortgage loans on real estate as of March 31, 2012, and December 31, 2011, respectively. The carrying value on the mortgage loans on real estate that were two or more payments delinquent as of March 31, 2012, was $77 million, or 1% of total mortgage loans on real estate. The total principal and interest past due on the mortgage loans on real estate that were two or more payments delinquent as of March 31, 2012, was $48 million. The carrying value on the mortgage loans on real estate that were two or more payments delinquent as of December 31, 2011, was $76 million, or 1% of total mortgage loans on real estate. The total principal and interest past due on the mortgage loans on real estate that were two or more payments delinquent as of December 31, 2011, was $41 million. See Note 1 in our 2011 Form 10-K for more information regarding our accounting policy relating to the impairment of mortgage loans on real estate.    Alternative Investments   Investment income (loss) on alternative investments by business segment (in millions) was as follows:         For the Three              Months Ended              March 31,              2012     2011     Change      Annuities  $ 6   $ 6     0%     Retirement Plan Services    3     4     -25%     Life Insurance    20     31     -35%     Group Protection    2     2     0%      Total (1)  $ 31   $ 43     -28%           (1)    Includes net investment income on the alternative investments supporting the required statutory surplus of our insurance businesses.      As of March 31, 2012, and December 31, 2011, alternative investments included investments in approximately 97 and 96 different partnerships, respectively, and the portfolio represented less than 1% of our overall invested assets. The partnerships do not represent off-balance sheet financing and generally involve several third-party partners. Some of our partnerships contain capital calls, which require us to contribute capital upon notification by the general partner. These capital calls are contemplated during the initial investment decision and are planned for well in advance of the call date. The capital calls are not material in size and are not material to our liquidity. Alternative investments are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and are included in other investments on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.   As discussed in “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Investments – Valuation of Alternative Investments” in our 2011 Form 10-K, we update the carrying value of our alternative investment portfolio whenever audited financial statements of the investees for the preceding year become available. Net investment income (loss) derived from our consolidated alternative investments by segment (in millions) related to the effect of preceding year audit adjustments recorded during the indicated year at the investee was as follows:           For the Three                Months Ended                March 31,                2012     2011     Change      Annuities  $ 4   $ 3     33%     Retirement Plan Services    2     2     0%     Life Insurance    13     21     -38%     Group Protection    2     2     0%      Total  $ 21   $ 28     -25%                81               Non-Income Producing Investments   As of March 31, 2012, and December 31, 2011, the carrying amount of fixed maturity securities, mortgage loans on real estate and real estate that were non-income producing was $16 million and $14 million, respectively.

The profitability of our fixed annuity and life insurance products is affected by our ability to achieve target spreads, or margins, between the interest income earned on the general account assets and the interest credited to the contract holder on our average fixed account values, including the fixed portion of variable. Net investment income and the interest rate yield table each include commercial mortgage loan prepayments and bond makewhole premiums, alternative investments and contingent interest and standby real estate equity commitments. These items can vary significantly from period to period due to a number of factors and, therefore, can provide results that are not indicative of the underlying trends.   The decrease in net investment income when comparing the three months ended March 31, 2012, to the same period of 2011 was attributable primarily to new money rates averaging below our portfolio yields, lower prepayment and bond makewhole premiums (see “Commercial Mortgage Loan Prepayment and Bond Makewhole Premiums” below for more information) and less favorable investment income on alternative investments (see “Alternative Investments” above), partially offset by higher invested assets driven primarily by favorable net flows on fixed account values, including the fixed portion of variable.   Commercial Mortgage Loan Prepayment and Bond Makewhole Premiums   Prepayment and makewhole premiums are collected when borrowers elect to call or prepay their debt prior to the stated maturity. A prepayment or makewhole premium allows investors to attain the same yield as if the borrower made all scheduled interest payments until maturity. These premiums are designed to make investors indifferent to prepayment.   The decrease in prepayment and makewhole premiums when comparing 2012 to 2011 was attributable primarily to abnormally high prepayments and makewhole premiums during 2011 due to a rapid decline in interest rates leading to increased refinancing activity.   Realized Gain (Loss) Related to Certain Investments   The detail of the realized gain (loss) related to certain investments (in millions) was as follows:           For the Three                Months Ended                March 31,                2012     2011     Change      Fixed maturity AFS securities:                       Gross gains  $ 5   $ 36     -86%      Gross losses    (63 )   (63 )   0%     Equity AFS securities:                       Gross gains    1     8     -88%     Gain (loss) on other investments    7     13     -46%      Associated amortization of DAC, VOBA, DSI, and DFEL and changes in other contract holder funds     2     (9 )   122%       Total realized gain (loss) related to certain investments, pre-tax   $ (48 ) $ (15 )  NM        Amortization of DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL and changes in other contract holder funds reflect an assumption for an expected level of credit-related investment losses. When actual credit-related investment losses are realized, we recognize a true-up to our DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL amortization and changes in other contract holder funds within realized loss reflecting the incremental effect of actual versus expected credit-related investment losses. These actual to expected amortization adjustments could create volatility in net realized gains and losses. The write-down for impairments includes both credit-related and interest-rate related impairments.          83                 Realized gains and losses generally originate from asset sales to reposition the portfolio or to respond to product experience. During the first three months of 2012 and 2011, we sold securities for gains and losses. In the process of evaluating whether a security with an unrealized loss reflects declines that are other-than-temporary, we consider our ability and intent to sell the security prior to a recovery of value. However, subsequent decisions on securities sales are made within the context of overall risk monitoring, assessing value relative to other comparable securities and overall portfolio maintenance. Although our portfolio managers may, at a given point in time, believe that the preferred course of action is to hold securities with unrealized losses that are considered temporary until such losses are recovered, the dynamic nature of portfolio management may result in a subsequent decision to sell. These subsequent decisions are consistent with the classification of our investment portfolio as AFS. We expect to continue to manage all non-trading invested assets within our portfolios in a manner that is consistent with the AFS classification.   We consider economic factors and circumstances within countries and industries where recent write-downs have occurred in our assessment of the status of securities we own of similarly situated issuers. While it is possible for realized or unrealized losses on a particular investment to affect other investments, our risk management has been designed to identify correlation risks and other risks inherent in managing an investment portfolio. Once identified, strategies and procedures are developed to effectively monitor and manage these risks. The areas of risk correlation that we pay particular attention to are risks that may be correlated within specific financial and business markets, risks within specific industries and risks associated with related parties.   When the detailed analysis by our credit analysts and investment portfolio managers leads us to the conclusion that a security’s decline in fair value is other-than-temporary, the security is written down to estimated recovery value. In instances where declines are considered temporary, the security will continue to be carefully monitored. See “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” in our 2011 Form 10-K for additional information on our portfolio management strategy.   Details underlying write-downs taken as a result of OTTI (in millions) were as follows:             For the Three                  Months Ended                  March 31,                  2012     2011     Change      Corporate bonds    $ (19 ) $ (3 )  NM      RMBS      (18 )   (20 )   10%     CMBS      (20 )   (24 )   17%     CDOs      -     (1 )   100%     Hybrid and redeemable preferred securities      -     (2 )   100%      Gross OTTI recognized in net income (loss)      (57 )   (50 )   -14%       Associated amortization of DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL       10     9     11%       Net OTTI recognized in net income (loss), pre-tax     $ (47 ) $ (41 )   -15%                              Portion of OTTI Recognized in OCI                        Gross OTTI recognized in OCI    $ 58   $ 8    NM      Change in DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL      (8 )   (5 )   -60%      Net portion of OTTI recognized in OCI, pre-tax    $ 50   $ 3    NM        The increase in write-downs for OTTI when comparing the first three months of 2012 to the same period in 2011 was primarily due to structured interest only corporate bonds with floating rate coupons where the projected cash flows were less than expected based on current and expected future Libor rates. The $115 million of impairments taken during the first three months of 2012 were split between $57 million of credit-related impairments and $58 million of noncredit-related impairments. The credit-related impairments were largely attributable to our RMBS and CMBS holdings primarily as a result of continued weakness within the commercial and residential real estate market that affected select RMBS and CMBS holdings. The noncredit-related impairments were incurred due to declines in values of securities for which we do not have an intent to sell or it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the securities before recovery.            84             REVIEW OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION   Liquidity and Capital Resources   Sources of Liquidity and Cash Flow   Liquidity refers to the ability of an enterprise to generate adequate amounts of cash from its normal operations to meet cash requirements with a prudent margin of safety. Our principal sources of cash flow from operating activities are insurance premiums and fees and investment income, while sources of cash flows from investing activities result from maturities and sales of invested assets. Our operating activities provided cash of $282 million and $340 million for the first three months of 2012 and 2011, respectively. When considering our liquidity and cash flow, it is important to distinguish between the needs of our insurance subsidiaries and the needs of the holding company, LNC. As a holding company with no operations of its own, LNC derives its cash primarily from its operating subsidiaries.   The sources of liquidity of the holding company are principally comprised of dividends and interest payments from subsidiaries, augmented by holding company short-term investments, bank lines of credit and the ongoing availability of long-term public financing under an SEC-filed shelf registration statement. These sources of liquidity and cash flow support the general corporate needs of the holding company, including its common and preferred stock dividends, interest and debt service, funding of callable securities, securities repurchases, acquisitions and investment in core businesses. Our cash flows associated with collateral received from and posted with counterparties change as the market value of the underlying derivative contract changes. As the value of a derivative asset declines (or increases), the collateral required to be posted by our counterparties would also decline (or increase). Likewise, when the value of a derivative liability declines (or increases), the collateral we are required to post for our counterparties’ benefit would also decline (or increase). During the first three months of 2012, our payables for collateral on derivative investments decreased by $849 million as steadily rising equity markets and less volatility lowered the fair values of the associated derivative investments. For additional information, see “Credit Risk” in Note 5.   Details underlying the primary sources of our holding company cash flows (in millions) were as follows:         For the Three              Months Ended              March 31,              2012     2011     Change      Dividends from Subsidiaries                      The Lincoln National Life Insurance Company  $ 150   $ 150     0%     Other    -     6     -100%      Loan Repayments and Interest from Subsidiaries                       Interest on inter-company notes    33     32     3%      $ 183   $ 188     -3%     Other Cash Flow and Liquidity Items                       Net capital received from (paid for taxes on) stock option exercises and restricted stock   $ (1 ) $ (1 )   0%      $ (1 ) $ (1 )   0%       The table above focuses on significant and recurring cash flow items and excludes the effects of certain financing activities, namely the periodic issuance and retirement of debt and cash flows related to our inter-company cash management program (discussed below). Taxes have been eliminated from the analysis due to a tax sharing agreement among our primary subsidiaries resulting in a modest effect on net cash flows at the holding company. Also excluded from this analysis is the modest amount of investment income on short-term investments of the holding company.   Subsidiaries’ Statutory Reserving and Surplus   For discussion of our strategies to lessen the burden of increased AG38 and XXX statutory reserves associated with certain UL products and other products with secondary guarantees on our insurance subsidiaries, see “Results of Life Insurance – Income (Loss) from Operations – Strategies to Address Statutory Reserve Strain.”            85             Financing Activities   Although our subsidiaries currently generate adequate cash flow to meet the needs of our normal operations, periodically we may issue debt or equity securities to maintain ratings and increase liquidity, as well as to fund internal growth, acquisitions and the retirement of our debt and equity securities.   We currently have an effective shelf registration statement, which allows us to issue, in unlimited amounts, securities, including debt securities, preferred stock, common stock, warrants, stock purchase contracts, stock purchase units, depository shares and trust preferred securities of our affiliated trusts.   Details underlying debt and financing activities (in millions) were as follows:         For the Three Months Ended March 31, 2012                          Change                                Maturities     in Fair                    Beginning           and     Value     Other     Ending        Balance     Issuance     Repayments     Hedges     Changes (1)     Balance      Short-Term Debt                                        Current maturities of long-term debt (2)  $ 300   $ -   $ -   $ -   $ -   $ 300      Total short-term debt  $ 300   $ -   $ -   $ -   $ -   $ 300                                            Long-Term Debt                                        Senior notes  $ 3,730   $ 300   $ -   $ (86 ) $ 1   $ 3,945     Bank borrowing    200     -     -     -     -     200      Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis advance     250     -     -     -     -     250     Capital securities    1,211     -     -     -     -     1,211      Total long-term debt  $ 5,391   $ 300   $ -   $ (86 ) $ 1   $ 5,606           (1)     Includes the net increase (decrease) in commercial paper, non-cash reclassification of long-term debt to current maturities of long-term debt, accretion of discounts and (amortization) of premiums, as applicable.        (2)     Consisted of a $300 million 5.65% fixed rate senior note that matures in less than one year.      On March 29, 2012, we completed the issuance and sale of $300 million aggregate principal amount of our 4.20% senior notes due 2022. We expect to repay the $300 million 5.65% fixed rate senior note maturing on August 27, 2012, with these proceeds. In addition to the maturing note discussed above, within the next two years, we have a $200 million floating rate senior note maturing on July 18, 2013; a $300 million 4.75% senior note maturing on January 30, 2014; and a $200 million 4.75% senior note maturing on February 14, 2014. The specific resources or combination of resources that we will use to meet these maturities will depend upon, among other things, the financial market conditions present at the time of maturity. As of March 31, 2012, the holding company had approximately $800 million in cash and cash equivalents and $25 million invested in fixed maturity corporate bonds; however, as discussed below, it had a $19 million receivable under the inter-company cash management program.   For information about our short-term and long-term debt and our credit facilities and LOCs, see Note 12 in our 2011 Form 10-K.   We have not accounted for repurchase agreements, securities lending transactions, or other transactions involving the transfer of financial assets with an obligation to repurchase the transferred assets as sales and do have any other transactions involving the transfer of financial assets with an obligation to repurchase the transferred assets. For information about our collateralized financing transactions on our investments, see “Payables for Collateral on Investments” in Note 4.   If current credit ratings and claims-paying ratings were downgraded in the future, terms in our derivative agreements may be triggered, which could negatively affect overall liquidity. For the majority of our counterparties, there is a termination event should the long-term senior debt ratings of LNC drop below BBB-/Baa3 (S&P/Moody’s). Our long-term senior debt held a rating of A-/Baa2 (S&P/Moody’s) as of March 31, 2012. In addition, contractual selling agreements with intermediaries could be negatively affected, which could have an adverse effect on overall sales of annuities, life insurance and investment products. See “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors – Liquidity and Capital Position – A decrease in the capital and surplus of our insurance subsidiaries may result in a downgrade to our credit and insurer financial strength ratings” and “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors – Covenants and Ratings – A downgrade in our financial strength or credit ratings could limit our ability to market products, increase the number or value of policies being surrendered and/or hurt our relationships with creditors” in our 2011 Form 10-K for more information.          86             See “Part I – Item 1. Business – Financial Strength Ratings” in our 2011 Form 10-K for additional information on our current financial strength ratings.   See “Part II – Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Review of Consolidated Financial Condition – Liquidity and Capital Resources – Financing Activities” in our 2011 Form 10-K for information on our credit ratings.    Alternative Sources of Liquidity    In order to manage our capital more efficiently, we have an inter-company cash management program where certain subsidiaries can lend to or borrow from the holding company to meet short-term borrowing needs. The cash management program is essentially a series of demand loans, which are permitted under applicable insurance laws, among LNC and its affiliates that reduces overall borrowing costs by allowing LNC and its subsidiaries to access internal resources instead of incurring third-party transaction costs. For our Indiana-domiciled insurance subsidiaries, the borrowing and lending limit is currently the lesser of 3% of the insurance company’s admitted assets and 25% of its surplus, in both cases, as of its most recent year end. The holding company did not borrow from the cash management program during the first quarter of 2012; however, it had an outstanding receivable of $19 million from certain subsidiaries resulting from funds borrowed by the subsidiaries in excess of amounts placed by those subsidiaries in the inter-company cash management account as of March 31, 2012. Any increase (decrease) in either of these holding company cash management program payable balances results in an immediate and equal increase (decrease) to holding company cash and cash equivalents.   Our insurance subsidiaries, by virtue of their general account fixed income investment holdings, can access liquidity through securities lending programs and repurchase agreements. As of March 31, 2012, our insurance subsidiaries had securities with a carrying value of $200 million out on loan under the securities lending program and $280 million carrying value subject to reverse-repurchase agreements. The cash received in our securities lending program is typically invested in cash equivalents, short-term investments or fixed maturity securities.   For factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in this section, see “Forward-Looking Statements – Cautionary Language” above and “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2011 Form 10-K.   Divestitures   For a discussion of our divestitures, see Note 3 in our 2011 Form 10-K.   Uses of Capital   Our principal uses of cash are to pay policy claims and benefits, operating expenses, commissions and taxes, to purchase new investments, to purchase reinsurance, to fund policy surrenders and withdrawals, to pay dividends to our stockholders and to repurchase our stock and debt securities.   Return of Capital to Common Stockholders   One of the Company’s primary goals is to provide a return to our common stockholders through share price accretion, dividends and stock repurchases. In determining dividends, the Board takes into consideration items such as current and expected earnings, capital needs, rating agency considerations and requirements for financial flexibility. The amount and timing of share repurchase depends on key capital ratios, rating agency expectations, the generation of free cash flow and an evaluation of the costs and benefits associated with alternative uses of capital.   Details underlying this activity (in millions, except per share data), were as follows:           For the Three                Months Ended                March 31,                2012     2011     Change      Common dividends to stockholders  $ 23   $ 16     44%     Repurchase of common stock    150     75     100%      Total cash returned to stockholders  $ 173   $ 91     90%                            Number of shares repurchased    6.018     2.414     149%     Average price per share  $ 24.90   $ 31.09     -20%                87             On November 10, 2011, our Board of Directors approved an increase of the dividend on our common stock from $0.05 to $0.08 per share. Additionally, we expect to repurchase additional shares of common stock during 2012 depending on market conditions and alternative uses of capital. For more information regarding share repurchases, see “Part II – Item 2(c)” below.   Other Uses of Capital   In addition to the amounts in the table above in “Return of Capital to Common Stockholders,” other uses of holding company cash flow (in millions) were as follows:           For the Three                Months Ended                March 31,                2012     2011     Change      Debt service (interest paid)  $ 59   $ 63     -6%     Capital contribution to subsidiaries    -     8     -100%      Total  $ 59   $ 71     -17%       The above table focuses on significant and recurring cash flow items and excludes the effects of certain financing activities, namely the periodic retirement of debt and cash flows related to our inter-company cash management account. Taxes have been eliminated from the analysis due to a tax sharing agreement among our primary subsidiaries resulting in a modest effect on net cash flows at the holding company.   Significant Trends in Sources and Uses of Cash Flow   As stated above, LNC’s cash flow, as a holding company, is largely dependent upon the dividend capacity of its insurance company subsidiaries as well as their ability to advance funds to it through inter-company borrowing arrangements, which may be affected by factors influencing the insurance subsidiaries’ RBC and statutory earnings performance. We currently expect to be able to meet the holding company’s ongoing cash needs and to have sufficient capital to offer downside protection in the event that the capital and credit markets experience another period of extreme volatility and disruption. A decline in capital market conditions, which reduces our insurance subsidiaries’ statutory surplus and RBC, may require them to retain more capital and may pressure our subsidiaries’ dividends to the holding company, which may lead us to take steps to preserve or raise additional capital. For factors that could affect our expectations for liquidity and capital, see “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2011 Form 10-K.   OTHER MATTERS   Other Factors Affecting Our Business   In general, our businesses are subject to a changing social, economic, legal, legislative and regulatory environment. Some of the changes include initiatives to require more reserves to be carried by our insurance subsidiaries. Although the eventual effect on us of the changing environment in which we operate remains uncertain, these factors and others could have a material effect on our results of operations, liquidity and capital resources. For factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in this section, see “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2011 Form 10-K and “Forward-Looking Statements – Cautionary Language” above.   Recent Accounting Pronouncements   See Note 2 for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements that have been implemented during the periods presented or that have been issued and are to be implemented in the future.   Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk   We analyze and manage the risks arising from market exposures of financial instruments, as well as other risks, in an integrated asset-liability management process that takes diversification into account. By aggregating the potential effect of market and other risks on the entire enterprise, we estimate, review and in some cases manage the risk to our earnings and shareholder value. We have exposures to several market risks including interest rate risk, equity market risk, default risk, basis risk, credit risk and, to a lesser extent, foreign currency exchange risk. The exposures of financial instruments to market risks, and the related risk management processes, are most important to our business where most of the invested assets support accumulation and investment-oriented insurance products. As an important element of our integrated asset-liability management processes, we use derivatives to minimize the effects of changes in interest levels, the shape of the yield curve, currency movements and volatility. In this context, derivatives are designated as a hedge and serve to minimize interest rate risk by mitigating the effect of significant          88             increases in interest rates on our earnings. Additional market exposures exist in our other general account insurance products and in our debt structure and derivatives positions. Our primary sources of market risk are: substantial, relatively rapid and sustained increases or decreases in interest rates or a sharp drop in equity market values. These market risks are discussed in detail in the following pages and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements (“Notes”) presented in “Item 1.

(2)    Contracts currently within new money rate bands are grouped according to the corresponding portfolio rate band in which they will fall upon their first anniversary.        (3)    The average crediting rates for discretionary rate setting products were 67 basis points, 6 basis points and 2 basis points in excess of average minimum guaranteed rates for our Annuities, Retirement Plan Services and Life Insurance segments, respectively.        (4)    The average crediting rates were 171 basis points in excess of average minimum guaranteed rates for multi-year guarantee             89             products; 19%, 10% and 71% of our total multi-year guarantee account values are scheduled to reset in 2012, 2013 and 2014 and beyond, respectively. Our indexed renewal business resets either annually or bi-annually. Upon reset, we are able to adjust product features to reflect changes in option prices.     (5)    For Annuities, this amount relates primarily to immediate annuity and short-term dollar cost averaging business. For Retirement Plan Services, this amount relates to indexed-based rate setting products in which the average crediting rates were 4 basis points in excess of average minimum guaranteed rates and 84% of account values were already at their minimum guaranteed rates.      The maturity structure and call provisions of the related portfolios are structured to afford protection against erosion of investment portfolio yields during periods of declining interest rates. We devote extensive effort to evaluating the risks associated with falling interest rates by simulating asset and liability cash flows for a wide range of interest rate scenarios. We seek to manage these exposures by maintaining a suitable maturity structure and by limiting our exposure to call risk in each respective investment portfolio.   Derivatives   See Note 5 for information on our derivatives used to hedge our exposure to changes in interest rates.   Equity Market Risk   Our revenues, assets, liabilities and derivatives are exposed to equity market risk. Due to the use of our reversion to the mean (“RTM”) process and our hedging strategies, we expect that, in general, short-term fluctuations in the equity markets should not have a significant effect on our quarterly earnings from unlocking of assumptions for deferred acquisition costs, value of business acquired, deferred sales inducements and deferred front-end loads. However, earnings are affected by equity market movements on account values and assets under management and the related fees we earn on those assets. Refer to “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Introduction – Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL” in our 2011 Form 10-K for further discussion on the effects of equity markets on our RTM.   Effect of Equity Market Sensitivity   The following presents our estimate of the effect on income (loss) from operations (in millions), from the change in asset-based fees and related expenses, if the level of the Standard & Poor’s (“S&P”) 500 Index® (“S&P 500”), which ended at 1408 as of March 31, 2012, were to decrease to 1126 over six months after March 31, 2012, and remain at that level through the next six months or increase to 1690 over six months after March 31, 2012, and remain at that level through the next six months, excluding any effect related to sales, prospective unlocking, persistency, hedge program performance or customer behavior caused by the equity market change:           S&P 500     S&P 500          at 1126 (1)     at 1690 (1)      Segment            Annuities  $ (82 ) $ 44     Retirement Plan Services    (9 )   10           (1)    The baseline for these effects assumes a 4% annual equity market growth rate, depending on the block of business, beginning on April 1, 2012. The baseline is then compared to scenarios of the S&P 500 at the 1126 and 1690 levels, which assume the index moves to those levels over six months, remains at those levels through the next six months and grows at 4% annually, depending on the block of business, thereafter. The difference between the baseline and the S&P 500 at the 1126 and 1690 level scenarios is presented in the table.      Refer to “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Introduction – Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL – Reversion to the Mean” in our 2011 Form 10-K for discussion of the effects of equity markets on our RTM.   The effect on earnings summarized above is a hypothetical scenario for the next 12 months. The effect of quarterly equity market changes upon fee revenues and asset-based expenses is generally not fully recognized in the first quarter of the change because fee revenues are earned and related expenses are incurred based upon daily variable account values. The difference between the current period average daily variable account values compared to the end of period variable account values affects fee revenues in subsequent periods. Additionally, the effect on earnings may not necessarily be symmetrical with comparable increases in the equity markets. This discussion concerning the estimated effects of ongoing equity market volatility on the fees we earn from          90             account values and assets under management is intended to be illustrative. Actual effects may vary depending on a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control, such as changing customer behaviors that might result in changes in the mix of our business between variable and fixed annuity contracts, switching among investment alternatives available within variable products, changes in sales production levels or changes in policy persistency. For purposes of this guidance, the change in account values is assumed to correlate with the change in the relevant index.    Credit-Related Derivatives   We use credit-related derivatives to minimize our exposure to credit-related events and we also sell credit default swaps to offer credit protection to our contract holders and investors. See Note 5 for additional information.   Credit Risk    See Note 5 for information on our credit risk.   In addition to the information provided about our counterparty exposure in Note 5, the fair value of our exposure by rating (in millions) was as follows:                   As of       As of                March 31,   December 31,                2012        2011         Rating                                AA       $    22        $    23         A            38             56         BBB            1             2             Total       $    61        $    81           Item 4. Controls and Procedures   Conclusions Regarding Disclosure Controls and Procedures   We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, which are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As of the end of the period required by this report, we, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting them to material information relating to us and our consolidated subsidiaries required to be disclosed in our periodic reports under the Exchange Act.   Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting   There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended March 31, 2012, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.   A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the company have been detected. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.            91             PART II – OTHER INFORMATION   Item 1.
