Item 1A. RISK FACTORSSee Item 1A: Risk Factors, on pages 14 - 25 of our 2011 Form 10-K for a discussion of risk factors that impact our operations and financial results. With the exception of the below, there have been no material changes in the risk factors as discussed therein.The acquisition of Morgan Keegan involves risks that could affect our business.On April 2, 2012 we completed our purchase of all of the issued and outstanding shares of Morgan Keegan (refer to the discussion of this acquisition in Note 2 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q). Acquisitions of this magnitude pose numerous risks, including: difficulty in integrating our and Morgan Keegan’s businesses, services and products; failure to achieve anticipated synergies or realize the projected benefits of the transaction; diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns due to transaction-related issues; potential loss of clients or key employees; the need to combine accounting and data processing systems and management controls and to integrate relationships with clients, trading counterparties and business partners; the inability to sustain revenue and earnings growth; and changes in the capital markets. There is no assurance that this acquisition will yield all of the positive benefits anticipated. If we are not able to integrate successfully, there is a risk that our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows may be materially and adversely affected.Under the SPA, Regions has ongoing obligations to indemnify RJF with respect to certain litigation. See Note 2 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements under “other items of significance” for further details. RJF is relying on Regions fulfilling its indemnification obligations under the SPA with respect to litigation, including the Fairfax case discussed in Item 1: Legal Proceedings in this Form 10-Q.
