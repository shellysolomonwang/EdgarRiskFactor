Item 1A. RISK FACTORS  The following is provided as an update to the risk factors included in Item 1A, “Risk Factors”, of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2007.   The Company's Operations Could Be Adversely Affected by Serious Weather Conditions  For the past several years, the Company has been unable to obtain meaningful hurricane-related insurance coverage at a reasonable cost for its headquarters complex in St. Petersburg, Florida. Due to the modest hurricane activity during the past three seasons, such coverage has become more readily available and, effective May 15, 2008, the Company has increased its limits to levels management considers adequate for such a catastrophe. Notwithstanding this coverage, the Company’s business continuity plan continues to be enhanced and tested to allow for continuous business processing in the event of weather-related or other interruptions of operations at the headquarters complex.
