Item 1A. RISK FACTORS   See Item 1A: Risk Factors, on pages 13 - 23 of our 2010 Form 10-K for a discussion of risk factors that impact our operations and financial results. With the exception of the below, there have been no material changes in the risk factors as discussed therein.   Concerns Regarding Downgrade of the U.S. Credit Rating Could Have a Material Adverse Effect on Our Business, Financial Condition and Liquidity   On August 5, 2011, Standard & Poor’s lowered its long term sovereign credit rating on the United States of America from AAA to AA+, while maintaining a negative outlook. While U.S. lawmakers reached agreement to raise the federal debt ceiling on August 2, 2011, the downgrade reflected Standard & Poor’s view that the fiscal consolidation plan within that agreement fell short of what would be necessary to stabilize the U.S. government’s medium term debt dynamics. This downgrade could have material adverse impacts on financial markets and economic conditions in the United States and throughout the world and, in turn, the market’s anticipation of these impacts could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and liquidity. Because of the unprecedented nature of negative credit rating actions with respect to U.S. government obligations, the ultimate impacts on global markets and our business, financial condition and liquidity are unpredictable and may not be immediately apparent.
