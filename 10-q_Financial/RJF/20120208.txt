Item 1A. RISK FACTORS   See Item 1A: Risk Factors, on pages 14 - 25 of our 2011 Form 10-K for a discussion of risk factors that impact our operations and financial results. With the exception of the below, there have been no material changes in the risk factors as discussed therein.   The acquisition of Morgan Keegan involves risks that could strategically affect our business.   On January 11, 2012 we announced that RJF entered into a definitive stock purchase agreement to acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of Morgan Keegan (refer to the discussion of this subsequent event in Note 19 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q).   Acquisitions of this magnitude pose numerous risks, including: difficulty in integrating our and Morgan Keegan’s businesses, services and products; failure to achieve anticipated synergies or realize the projected benefits of the transaction; diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns due to transaction related issues; potential loss of clients or key employees; the need to combine accounting and data processing systems and management controls and to integrate relationships with clients, trading counterparties and business partners; regulatory and other approvals and conditions to the transaction are not received or satisfied on a timely basis or at all; the possibility that modifications to the terms of the transaction may be required to obtain or satisfy regulatory approvals or conditions to closing; changes in the anticipated timing for closing the transaction; the inability to sustain revenue and earnings growth; and changes in the capital markets. There is no assurance that this acquisition will yield all of the positive benefits anticipated. If we are not able to integrate successfully, there is a risk that our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows may be materially and adversely affected.        77             Item 2.
