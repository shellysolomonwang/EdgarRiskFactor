Item 1a. Risk FactorsOur Form 10-K contains detailed cautionary statements which identify all known material risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from historical or expected results. Except as noted below, there have been no material changes to the risk factors we have previously disclosed in Item 1a, Risk Factors, in our Form 10-K.Our acquisitions and other strategic transactions may not produce anticipated results.•We have made and expect to continue to make acquisitions or enter into other strategic transactions to strengthen our business and grow our Company.•Such transactions, including our pending acquisition of SNL Financial LC, present significant challenges and risks.•The market for acquisition targets and other strategic transactions is highly competitive, especially in light of industry consolidation, which may affect our ability to complete such transactions.•If we are unsuccessful in completing such transactions or if such opportunities for expansion do not arise, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected.•If such transactions are completed, the anticipated growth and other strategic objectives of such transactions may not be fully realized, and a variety of factors may adversely affect any anticipated benefits from such transactions. For instance, the process of integration may require more resources than anticipated, we may assume unintended liabilities, there may be unexpected regulatory and operating difficulties and expenditures, we may fail to retain key personnel of the acquired business and such transactions may divert management’s focus from other business operations.•The anticipated benefits from an acquisition or other strategic transaction may not be realized fully, or may take longer to realize than expected. For instance, although we have identified approximately $70 million in synergies expected to be realized by 2019 largely from operational efficiencies and our ability to accelerate SNL Financial’s international growth through its global footprint, there is no guarantee that we will be able to achieve any or all of these synergies. As a result, the failure of acquisitions and other strategic transactions to perform as expected could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.Item 2.
