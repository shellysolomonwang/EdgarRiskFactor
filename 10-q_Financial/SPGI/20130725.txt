Item 1a. Risk FactorsOur Form 10-K contains detailed cautionary statements which identify all known material risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from historical or expected results. As we have completed the sale of McGraw-Hill Education on March 22, 2013 to investment funds affiliated with Apollo Global Management, LLC we have updated our associated risk factor in its entirety as set forth below in our Form 10-Q for the three months ended March 31, 2013. There have been no material changes to the other risk factors we have previously disclosed in Item 1a, Risk Factors, in our Form 10-K.Risks associated with the sale of McGraw-Hill Educationâ€¢The sale has resulted in two separate independent companies each of which is a smaller, less diversified company than we currently were with a narrower business focus than we previously had. In addition, diversification of revenues, costs, and cash flows may diminish. As such, it is possible that the results of operations, cash flows, working capital and financing requirements of the two separate businesses may be subject to increased volatility. Item 2.
