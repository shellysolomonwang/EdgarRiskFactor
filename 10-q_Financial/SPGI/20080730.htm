</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Board of Directors and Shareholders<BR>
of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We have reviewed the consolidated balance sheet of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc.,
as of June&nbsp;30, 2008, and the related consolidated statements of income for the
three-month and six-month periods ended June&nbsp;30, 2008 and 2007, and the consolidated
statements of cash flows for the six-month periods ended June&nbsp;30, 2008 and 2007.
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company&#146;s management.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We conducted our review in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). A review of interim financial information
consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of
persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less
in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board, the objective of which is the expression of an
opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not
express such an opinion.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Based on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be
made to the consolidated financial statements referred to above for them to be in
conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheet of The
McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. as of December&nbsp;31, 2007, and the related consolidated
statements of income, shareholders&#146; equity, and cash flows for the year then ended,
not presented herein, and in our report dated February&nbsp;26, 2008, we expressed an
unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements and included an
explanatory paragraph for the adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board
Interpretation No.&nbsp;48, &#147;Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an Interpretation
of FASB Statement No.&nbsp;109&#148;, effective January&nbsp;1, 2007. In our opinion, the
information set forth in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December
31, 2007, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the consolidated
balance sheet from which it has been derived.

    <TD>In March&nbsp;2007, the Company sold its mutual fund data business, which was part of
the Financial Services segment. This business was selected for divestiture, as it
no longer fit within the Company&#146;s strategic plans. The divestiture of the mutual
fund data business will enable the Financial Services segment to focus on its core
business of providing independent research, ratings, data indices and portfolio
services. For the six months ended June&nbsp;30, 2007 the Company recognized a pre-tax
gain of $17.3&nbsp;million ($10.3&nbsp;million after-tax, or $0.03 per diluted share). This

    <TD>On June&nbsp;22, 2007, the Company completed the conversion of its commercial paper
program from the Section&nbsp;3a (3)&nbsp;to the Section&nbsp;4(2) classification as defined
under the Securities Act of 1933. This conversion provides the Company with
greater flexibility relating to the use of proceeds received from the issuance of
commercial paper which may be sold to qualified institutional buyers and
accredited investors. All commercial paper issued by the Company subsequent to
this conversion date will be executed under the Section&nbsp;4(2) program. The Section
3a (3)&nbsp;program was officially terminated when all existing commercial paper
outstanding under this program matured in July&nbsp;2007. The size of the Company&#146;s
total commercial paper program remains $1.2&nbsp;billion and is supported by the
revolving credit agreement described below. Commercial paper borrowings
outstanding at June&nbsp;30, 2008 and 2007 totaled $526.2&nbsp;million and $536.1&nbsp;million,
respectively, with an average interest rate and average term of 2.2% and 27&nbsp;days,
and 5.4% and 43&nbsp;days, respectively. These total borrowings are classified as
current notes payable. There were no outstanding commercial paper borrowings as of
December&nbsp;31, 2007.</TD>

    <TD>The Company has a five-year revolving credit facility agreement of $1.2&nbsp;billion
that expires on July&nbsp;20, 2009. The Company pays a facility fee of seven basis
points on the credit facility agreement whether or not amounts have been borrowed,
and borrowings may be made at a spread of 13 basis points above the prevailing
London Inter-Bank Offer Rate (&#147;LIBOR&#148;). This spread increases to 18 basis points
for borrowings exceeding 50% of the total capacity available under the facility.</TD>

    <TD>The revolving credit facility contains certain covenants. The only financial
covenant requires that the Company not exceed indebtedness to cash flow ratio, as
defined, of 4 to 1 at any time. This restriction has never been exceeded. There

    <TD>The Company has the capacity to issue Extendible Commercial Notes (&#147;ECN&#147;s) of up
to $240&nbsp;million, provided that sufficient investor demand for the ECNs exists.
ECNs replicate commercial paper, except that the Company has an option to extend
the note beyond its initial redemption date to a maximum final maturity of 390
days. However, if exercised, such an extension is at a higher reset rate, which is
at a predetermined spread over LIBOR and is related to the Company&#146;s commercial
paper rating at the time of extension. As a result of the extension option, no
backup facilities for these borrowings are required. As is the case with
commercial paper, ECNs have no financial covenants. There were no ECN borrowings
outstanding as of June&nbsp;30, 2008 and December&nbsp;31, 2007. There were $66.1&nbsp;million in
ECN borrowings outstanding as of June&nbsp;30, 2007.</TD>

    <TD>On April&nbsp;19, 2007, the Company signed a promissory note with one of its providers
of banking services to enable the Company to borrow additional funds, on an
uncommitted basis, from time to time to supplement its commercial paper and ECN
borrowings. The specific terms (principal, interest rate and maturity date) of
each borrowing governed by this promissory note are determined on the borrowing
date of each loan. These borrowings have no financial covenants. There were no
promissory note borrowings outstanding as of June&nbsp;30, 2008 and December&nbsp;31, 2007.

    <TD>In December&nbsp;2003, the Company sold its 45% equity investment in Rock-McGraw, Inc.,
which owns the Company&#146;s headquarters building in New York City. The transaction
was valued at $450.0&nbsp;million, including assumed debt. Proceeds from the
disposition were $382.1&nbsp;million. The sale resulted in a pre-tax gain of $131.3
million and an after-tax benefit of $58.4&nbsp;million, or $0.15 per diluted share in
2003.</TD>

    <TD>The Company remains an anchor tenant of what continues to be known as The
McGraw-Hill Companies building and will continue to lease space from Rock-McGraw,
Inc., under an existing lease through 2020. As of December&nbsp;31, 2007, the Company
leased approximately 17% of the building space. This lease is being accounted for
as an operating lease. Pursuant to sale-leaseback accounting rules, as a result
of the Company&#146;s continued involvement, a pre-tax gain of approximately $212.3
million ($126.3&nbsp;million after-tax) was deferred and will be amortized over the
remaining lease term as a reduction in rent expense. Information relating to the
sale-leaseback transaction for the periods ended June&nbsp;30 is as

    <TD>In a separate proceeding, the prosecutor&#146;s office in Parma, Italy is conducting an
investigation into the bankruptcy of Parmalat. In June&nbsp;2006, the prosecutor&#146;s
office issued a Note of Completion of an Investigation (&#147;Note of Completion&#148;)

Parmalat, that individual Standard &#038; Poor&#146;s rating analysts conspired with
Parmalat insiders and rating advisors to fraudulently or negligently cause the
Parmalat bankruptcy. The Note of Completion was served on eight Standard &#038; Poor&#146;s

prosecutor&#146;s intention that the named rating analysts should appear before a judge
in Parma for a preliminary hearing, at which hearing the judge will determine
whether there is sufficient evidence against the rating analysts to proceed to
trial. No date has been set for the preliminary hearing. On July&nbsp;7, 2006, a
defense brief was filed with the Parma prosecutor&#146;s office on behalf of the rating
analysts. The Company believes that there is no basis in fact or law to support

action and permitting plaintiffs to amend the Complaint on or before April&nbsp;16,
2008. On April&nbsp;7, 2008, the District Court granted the application of the lead
plaintiff to extend the deadline for its amendment of the Complaint to May&nbsp;7,
2008. On May&nbsp;7, 2008 an amended Complaint was filed alleging violations of the
federal securities laws; the Company and Mr.&nbsp;McGraw were named as additional
defendants. The amended Complaint asserts, among other things, that the
defendants failed to warn investors that problems in the structured finance
market, particularly the sub-prime lending market, would negatively affect the
Company&#146;s financial performance. Service of the amended Complaint was thereafter
effectuated. On June&nbsp;18, 2008, in response to a Consent Motion filed on behalf of

    <TD>During 2006, the Company completed a restructuring of a limited number of business
operations in McGraw-Hill Education, Information &#038; Media and Corporate, to enhance
the Company&#146;s long-term growth prospects. The restructuring included the
integration of the Company&#146;s elementary and secondary basal publishing businesses.
The Company recorded a pre-tax restructuring charge of $31.5&nbsp;million, consisting
primarily of employee severance and benefit costs related to the reduction of
approximately 700 positions across the Company and vacant facilities. This charge
was comprised of $16.0&nbsp;million for McGraw-Hill Education, $8.7&nbsp;million for
Information &#038; Media and $6.8&nbsp;million for Corporate. The after-tax charge recorded
was $19.8
million, or $0.06 per diluted share. Restructuring expenses for Information &#038;
Media and Corporate were classified as selling and general service expenses within
the statement of income. Restructuring expenses for McGraw-Hill Education were
$9.3&nbsp;million classified as selling and general product expenses, and $6.7&nbsp;million
classified as selling and general service expense within the statement of income.
At December&nbsp;31, 2007, the remaining liability was approximately $9.6&nbsp;million.</TD>

    <TD>In September&nbsp;2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#147;FASB&#148;) issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (&#147;SFAS&#148;) No.&nbsp;157, &#147;Fair Value
Measurements,&#148; (&#147;SFAS No.&nbsp;157&#148;) to clarify the definition of fair value,
establish a framework for measuring fair value and expand the disclosures on fair
value measurements. SFAS No.&nbsp;157 defines fair value as the price that would be
received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly
transaction between market participants at the measurement date. SFAS No.&nbsp;157
also stipulates that, as a market-based measurement, fair value measurement should
be determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in
pricing the asset or liability, and establishes a fair value hierarchy that
distinguishes between (a)&nbsp;market participant assumptions developed based on market
data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity (observable inputs)
and (b)&nbsp;the reporting entity&#146;s own assumptions about market participant
assumptions developed based on the best information available in the circumstances
(unobservable inputs). The Company adopted SFAS No.&nbsp;157 as of January&nbsp;1, 2008 for
financial assets and liabilities. The adoption of SFAS No.&nbsp;157 for financial
assets and liabilities did not have a material impact on the consolidated
financial statements. Further, in February&nbsp;2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff
Position (&#147;FSP&#148;) 157-2, &#147;Effective Date of FASB Statement No.&nbsp;157,&#148; (&#147;FSP FAS
157-2&#148;) which delays the effective date of SFAS No.&nbsp;157 for nonfinancial assets
and nonfinancial liabilities until fiscal years beginning after November&nbsp;15, 2008,
which for the Company is 2009. The Company is currently evaluating the impact FSP
FAS 157-2 will have on its consolidated financial statements.</TD>

    <TD>In December&nbsp;2007, the FASB issued SFAS No.&nbsp;160 &#147;Noncontrolling Interests in
Consolidated Financial Statements-an amendment of ARB No.&nbsp;51,&#148; (&#147;SFAS No.&nbsp;160&#148;).
SFAS No.&nbsp;160 amends Accounting Research Bulletin No.&nbsp;51, &#147;Consolidated Financial
Statements,&#148; to establish accounting and reporting standards for any
noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a
subsidiary. SFAS No.&nbsp;160 clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary
should be reported as a component of equity in the consolidated financial
statements and requires disclosure, on the face of the consolidated statement of
income, of the amounts of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and
to the noncontrolled interest. SFAS No.&nbsp;160 is effective for the Company beginning
January&nbsp;1, 2009 and is to be applied prospectively, except for the presentation
and disclosure requirements, which upon adoption will be applied retrospectively
for all periods presented. Early adoption of SFAS No.&nbsp;160 is prohibited. The

No.&nbsp;141(R)&#148;). SFAS No.&nbsp;141(R) fundamentally changes many aspects of existing
accounting requirements for business combinations. SFAS No.&nbsp;141(R) includes
guidance for the recognition and measurement of the identifiable assets acquired,
the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling or minority interest in the
acquired company. It also provides guidance for the measurement of goodwill, the
recognition of contingent consideration, the accounting for pre-acquisition gain
and loss contingencies as well as acquisition-related transaction costs. SFAS No.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In the second quarter of 2008 revenue and operating profit declined by 2.6% and
20.7%, respectively. The decrease in revenue and operating profit is primarily
attributable to the decline in the Financial Services segment of 10.4% and 25.4%,
respectively, primarily due to weakness in Credit Market Services. Partially
offsetting the revenue decrease was an increase of 3.6% in the McGraw-Hill Education
segment driven by the School Education Group and an increase of 6.8% in the
Information &#038; Media segment driven by the Business-to-Business Group. Lower
2008 incentive compensation helped mitigate the operating profit decline. Foreign
exchange rates positively impacted both revenue and operating profit by $22.5&nbsp;million
and $7.8&nbsp;million, respectively, during the second quarter of 2008.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In the second quarter of 2008, the Company restructured a limited number of business
operations in its Financial Services and McGraw-Hill Education segments to more
efficiently serve its markets and strengthen its long-term growth prospects. The
Company incurred a pre-tax restructuring charge of $23.7&nbsp;million ($14.8&nbsp;million
after-tax, or $0.05 per diluted share), which consisted primarily of severance costs
related to a workforce reduction of 395 positions.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Product revenue increased 4.7% in the second quarter of 2008, due primarily to growth
in the McGraw-Hill Education and Information &#038; Media segments as compared to the
second quarter of 2007.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Product operating-related expenses increased 4.9%, as compared to the second quarter
of 2007, primarily due to the growth in expenses at McGraw-Hill Education related to
major product launches in a strong 2008 state adoption market. Amortization of
prepublication costs increased by $9.2&nbsp;million or 16.2%, as compared with the second
quarter of 2007, as a result of adoption cycles.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Product related selling and general expenses increased 10.1% and product margin
decreased 2.2%, as compared to the second quarter of 2007, primarily due to the
growth in expenses at McGraw-Hill Education related to major product launches in a
strong 2008 state adoption market.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Service revenue decreased 6.6% in the second quarter of 2008 as compared to the same
period in 2007, due primarily to a 10.4% decrease in Financial Services. Financial
Services revenue decreased primarily due to Credit Market Services in light of the
significant declines in the structured finance market resulting from the current
credit problems experienced in the U.S. and in Europe, partially offset by growth in
Investment Services. Additionally, growth in the Information &#038; Media segment helped
partially offset this revenue decline. The service margin decreased 5.3% to 31.3% for
the second quarter of 2008 primarily due to the decline in Credit Market Services,
partially offset by reduced 2008 incentive compensation expense.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Total expenses in the second quarter of 2008 increased $50.4&nbsp;million or 4.0% as
compared to the same period in 2007 driven by increased sales opportunities in the
McGraw-Hill Education segment and the restructuring charge incurred by the Company in
the second quarter of 2008.

compared with interest expense of $12.1&nbsp;million for the second quarter of 2007. The
increase was mainly driven by the impact of $1.2&nbsp;billion in senior
notes issued in the fourth quarter of 2007. Also included in the second quarter of

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In the second quarter of 2008, revenue for the McGraw-Hill Education (&#147;MHE&#148;) segment
increased 3.6% or $23.5&nbsp;million from the prior year, while operating profit decreased
13.5%. Foreign exchange rates favorably affected revenue by $5.3&nbsp;million and had an
immaterial impact on operating profit for the quarter.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">During the second quarter of 2008, the MHE segment incurred a pre-tax restructuring
charge of $8.5&nbsp;million consisting primarily of employee severance costs related to
the reduction of 149 positions, primarily in the assessment business, where MHE is
taking steps to consolidate its resources, better leverage partnerships with key
strategic suppliers, and facilitate a strategic shift toward increased investments in
its digital and custom offerings. Across other parts of the segment, MHE is taking
steps to enable greater efficiencies, better address new and existing revenue
streams, and shift investments toward digital products.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In the second quarter of 2008, revenue for the McGraw-Hill School Education Group
(&#147;SEG&#148;) increased 6.9% or $28.5&nbsp;million compared with the second quarter of 2007.
Strong basal sales of K-5 reading in Florida and K-5 math in Texas were partially
offset by lower reorders of workbooks and other consumable reading materials in
several states due to timing and budget concerns. Total U.S. PreK-12 enrollment for
2007-2008 is estimated at 56&nbsp;million students, up 0.4% from 2006-2007, according to
the National Center for Education Statistics (&#147;NCES&#148;). The total available state new
adoption market in 2008 is estimated at between $900&nbsp;million and $950&nbsp;million
compared with approximately $820&nbsp;million in 2007.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The year&#146;s key opportunities in the state new adoption market are primarily offered
by K-5 reading in Florida, K-5 math in Texas, and K-8 math in California. Other
opportunities for 2008 include science in California, reading in Alabama, Indiana,
Louisiana, and Oklahoma, and social studies in Arkansas and Tennessee. With
decision-making largely completed in the adoption states that are buying reading in
2008, the Company expects to capture a majority share of the important Florida K-5
market as well as a major share of the overall K-12 reading/literature state new
adoption market. In the overall K-12 math state new adoption market, SEG projects a
strong share based on solid results in the K-5 Texas adoption as well as announced
K-8 decisions in California, where some sales activity may continue into the fall.
Despite concerns about the economy in many areas, no state adoptions scheduled for
purchasing in 2008 were cancelled and adoption activity remained brisk at the
district level in most states within this market.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Open territory sales, which have remained flat over the past two years, are projected
to increase modestly owing to pent-up demand for new instructional materials. Open
territory net basal sales for the industry remained flat as compared to the prior
year through May&nbsp;2008, the most recent period for which detailed information is
currently available. However, the bulk of open territory purchasing traditionally
occurs in the third quarter. Despite budget pressures, most states have maintained
or increased education funding levels in their new fiscal-year budgets.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">According to statistics compiled by the Association of American Publishers (&#147;AAP&#148;),
total net basal and supplementary sales of elementary and secondary instructional
materials increased 1.5% through May&nbsp;2008 compared to the same period in 2007. The
supplementary market has been declining in recent years, in large part because basal
programs are increasingly comprehensive, offering integrated ancillary materials that
reduce the need for separate supplemental products. According to the AAP report, the
industry&#146;s total basal sales increased by 6.0% through May&nbsp;2008, driven by growth in
the adoption states.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In the testing market, SEG&#146;s second-quarter non-custom or &#147;shelf&#148; testing revenue
increased over the prior year primarily due to increased <I>Acuity </I>revenues in New York
City and sales of the <I>TABE </I>series of assessments for adult learners and the <I>LAS</I>
series for English-language learners, gains which more than offset declines in older
products. Custom contract work decreased in 2008 compared to the same period last
year primarily due to reductions in scope and price on contracts in Florida and
Missouri, partially offset by an increase in scope on a West Virginia contract.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">At the McGraw-Hill Higher Education, Professional and International Group (&#147;HPI&#148;),
revenue decreased $5.0&nbsp;million or 2.1% for the quarter compared to prior year.
Foreign exchange rates favorably affected revenue by $5.3&nbsp;million.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Higher Education revenue declined in comparison to the prior year, although the
Career product line showed strong growth. A variation in bookstore ordering trends
from June to July affected quarterly results. Key titles contributing to
second-quarter performance included Thomson, <I>Crafting an Executive Strategy, </I>16/e;
Hill, <I>International Business, </I>7/e; Silberberg, <I>Chemistry</I>, 5/e; Knorre, <I>Puntos de
partida, </I>8/e; and Ober, <I>Keyboarding</I>, 10/e.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Revenue in the professional market declined versus the prior-year quarter due to
strong first-year sales of <I>McGraw-Hill Encyclopedia of Science and Technology</I>, which
was published in May&nbsp;2007, and overall softness in the market in 2008 as some
retailers cut back on orders and reduced inventory through higher returns. Compared
with the second quarter of 2007, HPI&#146;s overall international revenue increased in
most regions, notably India, Asia, Canada, Latin America and the Middle East,
partially offset by sales declines in Spain and Italy.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Financial Services revenue and operating profit for the second quarter of 2008
decreased 10.4% and 25.4%, respectively, from the second quarter of 2007. The
revenue and operating profit declines from prior year are mainly due to lower revenue
in Credit Market Services (&#147;CMS&#148;), partially offset by revenue growth in Investment
Services (&#147;IS&#148;). A reduction in 2008 incentive compensation helped mitigate the
operating profit reduction. Foreign exchange positively impacted revenue by $16.8
million and operating profit by $7.9&nbsp;million.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">During the second quarter of 2008, the Financial Services segment incurred a pre-tax
restructuring charge of $15.2&nbsp;million consisting primarily of employee severance
costs related to the reduction of 246 positions, driven by the current credit market
environment as well as the consolidation of several support functions.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">CMS revenue declined $127.8&nbsp;million or 20.1% from prior year, primarily as a result
of significant decreases in structured finance as well as decreases in corporate
(industrial and financial services) ratings, partially offset by increases in public
finance ratings and credit ratings-related information products such as RatingsXpress
and RatingsDirect and credit risk evaluation products and services.

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">



<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">During the second quarter of 2008, significant decreases in issuance volumes in both
the United States and Europe of residential mortgage-backed securities (&#147;RMBS&#148;), commercial mortgage-backed securities (&#147;CMBS&#148;),
collateralized debt obligations (&#147;CDO&#148;) and asset-backed securities (&#147;ABS&#148;)
contributed to the decrease in revenue.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Total U.S. structured finance new issue dollar volume decreased 81.0% in the second
quarter versus prior year. U.S. CDO issuance decreased 88.2%, according to Harrison
Scott Publications and Standard &#038; Poor&#146;s internal estimates (Harrison Scott
Publications/S&#038;P). The large decline in CDO issuance resulted from continued lack of
investor appetite for the complex deal structures which were in demand in the second
quarter of 2007 and secondary market trading liquidity concerns. Continued
deterioration in the subprime mortgage market has significantly impacted dollar
volume issuance in the U.S. RMBS market, which decreased 97.0% compared to prior
year. U.S. CMBS issuance decreased 85.3% over the prior year due to the market
dislocation attributed to high credit spreads resulting in high interest rates which
are not economical to borrowers. U.S. ABS issuance
decreased 19.1% compared to prior year. According to Thomson Financial, U.S.
corporate issuance by dollar volume for the second quarter of 2008 decreased 15.1%,
with investment grade down 7.2% and high yield issuance down 59.4%, driven by higher
credit spreads and decreased merger and acquisition activity. The U.S. municipal
market increased 18.7% resulting from issuance to refund existing debt, in addition
to raise new money to fund infrastructure projects.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In Europe for the second quarter, structured finance issuance decreased 75.2%
compared to the prior year and corporate and government issuance increased 8.6%.
European RMBS issuance decreased 76.7%. European CDO and CMBS issuance declined
56.7% and 99.3%, respectively, which is primarily attributed to higher credit
spreads. ABS issuance decreased 68.7% compared to the prior year.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">IS revenue increased $42.3&nbsp;million or 22.8%, driven by growth in index services and
Capital IQ products. Revenue related to Standard &#038; Poor&#146;s indices increased as
assets under management for exchange-traded funds (&#147;ETF&#148;) rose 15.5% from June&nbsp;30,
2007 to $206.3&nbsp;billion as of June&nbsp;30, 2008 and license fee revenue increased. ETF
assets under management at December&nbsp;31, 2007 were $235.3&nbsp;billion. The number of
exchange-traded futures and option contracts based on S&#038;P indices exhibited strong
increases in the second quarter of 2008 compared to the same period of the prior
year, thereby also contributing to the revenue growth. The number of Capital IQ
clients increased 23% from the second quarter end of 2007 to second quarter end of
2008.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Because of the current credit market conditions, issuance levels deteriorated
significantly across all asset classes. It is possible that the current market
conditions and global issuance levels in structured finance could persist through
2008. The outlook for RMBS, CMBS and CDO asset classes as well as other asset
classes is dependent upon many factors, including the general condition of the
economy, interest rates, credit quality and spreads, and the level of liquidity in
the financial markets.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The financial services industry is subject to the potential for increased regulation
in the United States and abroad. The businesses conducted by the Financial Services
segment are in certain cases regulated under the Credit Rating Agency Reform Act of
2006, U.S. Investment Advisers Act of 1940, the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934
and/or the laws of the states or other jurisdictions in which they conduct business.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Standard &#038; Poor&#146;s Ratings Services is a credit rating agency that is registered with
the Securities and Exchange Commission (&#147;SEC&#148;) as one of ten Nationally Recognized
Statistical Rating Organizations, or NRSROs. The SEC first began designating NRSROs
in 1975 for use of their credit ratings in the determination of capital charges for
registered brokers and dealers under the SEC&#146;s Net Capital Rule.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Credit rating agency legislation entitled &#147;Credit Rating Agency Reform Act of 2006&#148;
(the &#147;Act&#148;) was signed into law on September&nbsp;29, 2006. The Act created a new SEC
registration system for rating agencies that volunteer to be recognized as NRSROs.
Under the Act, the SEC is given authority and oversight of NRSROs and can censure
NRSROs, revoke their registration or limit or suspend their registration in certain
cases. The SEC is not authorized to review the analytical process, ratings criteria
or methodology of the NRSROs. An agency&#146;s decision to register and comply with the
Act will not constitute a waiver of or diminish any right, defense or privilege
available under applicable law. Pre-emption language is included in the Act
consistent with other legal precedent. The Company does not believe the Act will
have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">NRSRO under the Act. In March&nbsp;2008,
S&#038;P filed its first annual update of its registration with the SEC. The public
portions of S&#038;P&#146;s Form&nbsp;NRSRO are available on S&#038;P&#146;s website.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On June&nbsp;16, 2008, the SEC issued proposed rules that focus largely on NRSROs&#146;
structured finance ratings process. The proposed rules address a broad range of
issues, including disclosure and management of conflicts related to the issuer-pays
model, prohibitions against analysts&#146; accepting gifts or making &#147;recommendations&#148;
when rating a security, and limitations on analyst participation in fee discussions.
Under the proposed rules, additional records of all rating actions must be created,
retained and made public, and records must be kept of material deviations in
ratings assigned from model outputs as well as complaints about analysts&#146;
performance. The proposals require more disclosure of performance statistics and
methodologies, a new annual report by NRSROs of their rating actions to be provided
confidentially to the SEC, and unless structured finance ratings are distinguished
from other ratings, NRSROs will be required to issue a report describing the
differences for each structured rating. The deadline for comments was July 25, 2008. S&#038;P submitted comments on the proposals. The Company believes
that some of the proposals raise serious legal issues. On July&nbsp;1, 2008, the SEC also proposed changes to
numerous SEC rules and forms that expressly utilize NRSRO ratings. The deadline for
comments is September&nbsp;5, 2008. S&#038;P currently plans to submit comments on some of the
SEC&#146;s key proposals.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In the third quarter of 2007, rating agencies became subject to scrutiny for their
ratings on structured finance transactions that involve the packaging of subprime
residential mortgages, including residential mortgage-backed securities (&#147;RMBS&#148;) and
collateralized debt obligations (&#147;CDOs&#148;).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On August&nbsp;29, 2007, Standard &#038; Poor&#146;s received a subpoena from the New York Attorney
General&#146;s Office requesting information and documents relating to Standard &#038; Poor&#146;s
ratings of securities backed by residential real estate mortgages. Standard &#038; Poor&#146;s
has entered into an agreement with the New York Attorney General&#146;s Office which calls
for S&#038;P to implement certain structural reforms. The agreement resolves the Attorney
General&#146;s investigation with no monetary payment and no admission of wrongdoing.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In September&nbsp;2007, the SEC commenced an examination of rating agencies&#146; policies and
procedures regarding conflicts of interest and the application of those policies and
procedures to ratings on RMBS and related CDOs. Standard &#038; Poor&#146;s is cooperating
with the SEC staff in connection with this examination. The SEC issued its public
Report on July&nbsp;8, 2008. The SEC findings and recommendations addressed the
following subjects: (a)&nbsp;the SEC noted there was a substantial increase in the number
and complexity of RMBS and CDO deals since 2002, and some rating agencies appeared to
struggle with the growth; (b)&nbsp;significant aspects of the rating process were not
always disclosed; (c)&nbsp;policies and procedures for rating RMBS and CDOs could be
better documented; (d)&nbsp;the implementation of new practices by rating agencies with
respect to the information provided to them; (e)&nbsp;rating agencies did not always
document significant steps in the ratings process and they did not always document
significant participants in the ratings process; (f)&nbsp;the surveillance processes used
by the rating agencies appear to have been less robust than their initial ratings
processes; (g)&nbsp;issues were identified in the management of conflicts of interest and
improvements could be made; and (h)&nbsp;internal audit processes. S&#038;P has advised the SEC
it will be taking steps to enhance S&#038;P&#146;s policies and procedures consistent with the
SEC&#146;s recommendations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On October&nbsp;16, 2007, Standard &#038; Poor&#146;s received a subpoena from the Connecticut
Attorney General&#146;s Office requesting information and documents relating to the
conduct of Standard &#038; Poor&#146;s credit ratings business. The subpoena appears to relate
to an investigation by the Connecticut Attorney General into whether Standard &#038;
Poor&#146;s, in the conduct of its credit ratings business, violated the Connecticut
Antitrust Act. Subsequently, a second subpoena dated December&nbsp;6, 2007, seeking
information and documents relating to the rating of securities backed by residential
real estate mortgages, and a third subpoena dated January&nbsp;14, 2008, seeking
information and documents relating to the rating of municipal and corporate debt,
were served. The Attorney General&#146;s Office has also indicated that its investigation
is looking into whether Standard &#038; Poor&#146;s may have violated the Connecticut Unfair
Trade Practices Act. The Company is responding to the subpoenas.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On November&nbsp;8, 2007, Standard &#038; Poor&#146;s received a civil investigative demand from the
Massachusetts Attorney General&#146;s Office requesting information and documents relating
to Standard &#038; Poor&#146;s ratings of securities backed by residential real estate
mortgages. Standard &#038; Poor&#146;s is responding to this request.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Outside the United States, particularly in Europe, regulators and government

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Committee of
European Securities Regulators (&#147;CESR&#148;) which is charged with monitoring and
reporting to the European Commission on rating agencies&#146; compliance with IOSCO&#146;s Code
of Conduct (see below), and the International Organization of Securities Commissions
(&#147;IOSCO&#148;) have issued reports, consultations and questionnaires concerning the role
of credit rating agencies and potential regulation. In May&nbsp;2008, IOSCO issued a
report on the role of rating agencies in the structured finance market and related
changes to its 2004 Code of Conduct Fundamentals for Credit Rating Agencies. IOSCO&#146;s
report reflects comments received during a public consultation process. S&#038;P and other
global rating agencies contributed to this process. S&#038;P has started to implement many
of IOSCO&#146;s recommendations and expects to update its Code of Conduct as appropriate.
In May&nbsp;2008, CESR issued its second report to the European Commission on rating
agencies&#146; compliance with IOSCO&#146;s original Code of Conduct, the role of rating
agencies in structured finance and recommendations for, among other things,
additional
monitoring and oversight of rating agencies. CESR also requested public comments
during a consultation period leading up to the final report. In June&nbsp;2008, the
European Securities Markets Expert Group (ESME), a group of senior practitioners and
advisors to the European Commission, issued its report on the role of rating agencies
and a separate set of recommendations. S&#038;P engaged with ESME during its review
process. The European review of rating agencies and potential additional oversight
is expected to continue into the fall and, possibly, 2009.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Other regulatory developments include: a March&nbsp;2008 report by the President&#146;s Working
Group on Financial Markets that includes recommendations relating to rating agencies;
an April&nbsp;2008 report by the Financial Stability Forum that recommends changes in the
role and uses of credit ratings; and a July&nbsp;2008 report by the Committee on the
Global Financial System (Bank for International Settlements) on ratings in structured
finance. S&#038;P expects to continue to be involved in the follow up to these reports.
In many countries, S&#038;P is also an External Credit Assessment Institution (ECAI)&nbsp;under
Basel II for purposes of allowing banks to use its ratings in determining risk
weightings for many credit exposures. Recognized ECAIs may be subject to additional
oversight in the future.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">New legislation, regulations or judicial determinations applicable to credit rating
agencies in the United States and abroad could affect the competitive position of
Standard &#038; Poor&#146;s Ratings Services; however, the Company does not believe that any
new or currently proposed legislation, regulations or judicial determinations would
have a materially adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The market for credit ratings as well as research and investment advisory services is
very competitive. The Financial Services segment competes domestically and
internationally on the basis of a number of factors, including quality of ratings,
research and investment advice, client service, reputation, price, geographic scope,
range of products and technological innovation. In addition, in some of the
countries in which Standard &#038; Poor&#146;s competes, governments may provide financial or
other support to locally-based rating agencies and may from time to time establish
official credit rating agencies, credit ratings criteria or procedures for evaluating
local issuers.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">A writ of summons was served on The McGraw-Hill Companies, SRL and on The McGraw-Hill
Companies, SA (both indirect subsidiaries of the Company) (collectively, &#147;Standard &#038;
Poor&#146;s&#148;) on September&nbsp;29, 2005 and October&nbsp;7, 2005, respectively, in an action
brought in the Tribunal of Milan, Italy by Enrico Bondi (&#147;Bondi&#148;), the Extraordinary
Commissioner of Parmalat Finanziaria S.p.A. and Parmalat S.p.A. (collectively,
&#147;Parmalat&#148;). Bondi has brought numerous other lawsuits in both Italy and the United
States against entities and individuals who had dealings with Parmalat. In this
suit, Bondi claims that Standard &#038; Poor&#146;s, which had issued investment grade ratings
on Parmalat until shortly before Parmalat&#146;s collapse in December&nbsp;2003, breached its
duty to issue an independent and professional rating and negligently and knowingly
assigned inflated ratings in order to retain Parmalat&#146;s business. Alleging joint and
several liability, Bondi claims damages of euros 4,073,984,120 (representing the
value of bonds issued by Parmalat and the rating fees paid by Parmalat) with
interest, plus damages to be ascertained for Standard &#038; Poor&#146;s alleged complicity in
aggravating Parmalat&#146;s financial difficulties and/or for having contributed in
bringing about Parmalat&#146;s indebtedness towards its bondholders, and legal fees. The
Company believes that Bondi&#146;s allegations and claims for damages lack legal or
factual merit. Standard &#038; Poor&#146;s filed its answer, counterclaim and third-party
claims on March&nbsp;16, 2006 and will continue to vigorously contest the action.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In a separate proceeding, the prosecutor&#146;s office in Parma, Italy is conducting an
investigation into the bankruptcy of Parmalat. In June&nbsp;2006, the prosecutor&#146;s office
issued a Note of Completion of an Investigation (&#147;Note of Completion&#148;) concerning
allegations, based on Standard &#038; Poor&#146;s investment grade ratings of Parmalat, that
individual Standard &#038; Poor&#146;s rating analysts conspired with Parmalat insiders and
rating advisors to fraudulently or negligently cause the Parmalat bankruptcy. The
Note of Completion was served on eight Standard &#038; Poor&#146;s rating analysts. While not
a formal charge, the Note of Completion indicates the prosecutor&#146;s intention that the
named rating analysts should appear before a judge in Parma for a preliminary
hearing, at which hearing the judge will determine whether there is sufficient
evidence against the rating analysts to proceed to trial. No date has been set for
the preliminary hearing. On July&nbsp;7, 2006, a defense brief was filed with the Parma
prosecutor&#146;s office on behalf of

there is no basis in fact or law to support the allegations against the rating
analysts, and they will be vigorously defended by the subsidiaries involved.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company learned on August&nbsp;9, 2007 that a pro se action titled <I>Blomquist v.
Washington Mutual</I>, et al., was filed in the District Court for the Northern District
of California against numerous financial institutions, government agencies and
individuals, including the Company and Mr.&nbsp;Harold McGraw III, the CEO of the Company,
alleging various state and federal claims. The claims against the Company and Mr.
McGraw concern Standard &#038; Poor&#146;s ratings of subprime mortgage-backed securities. An
amended Complaint was filed in the <I>Blomquist </I>action on September&nbsp;10, 2007 which added
two other rating agencies as defendants. On February&nbsp;19, 2008 the Company was served
with the Complaint and, on February&nbsp;29, 2008, Mr.&nbsp;McGraw was served with the
Complaint. On May&nbsp;12, 2008, the Company and Mr.&nbsp;McGraw filed a motion to dismiss all
claims asserted against them. Similar motions were filed by other defendants.
Plaintiff filed papers opposing the motions on July&nbsp;1, 2008. A hearing on the motions was held on July 11, 2008 and, by Order dated July 23, 2008, the Court dismissed all claims asserted against the Company and Mr. McGraw and denied plaintiff leave to amend as against them.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company also learned that on August&nbsp;28, 2007 a putative shareholder class
action titled <I>Reese v. Bahash </I>was filed in the District Court for the District of
Columbia against Mr.&nbsp;Robert Bahash, the CFO of the Company, alleging claims under the
federal securities laws and state tort law concerning Standard &#038; Poor&#146;s ratings,
particularly its ratings of subprime mortgage-backed securities. Mr.&nbsp;Bahash was not
served with the Complaint. On February&nbsp;11, 2008, the District Court in the <I>Reese</I>
matter entered an order appointing a lead plaintiff in that action and permitting
plaintiffs to amend the Complaint on or before April&nbsp;16, 2008. On April&nbsp;7, 2008, the
District Court granted the application of the lead plaintiff to extend the deadline
for its amendment of the Complaint to May&nbsp;7, 2008. On May&nbsp;7, 2008 an amended
Complaint was filed alleging violations of the federal securities laws; the Company
and Mr.&nbsp;McGraw were named as additional defendants. The amended Complaint asserts,
among other things, that the defendants failed to warn investors that problems in the
structured finance market, particularly the sub-prime lending market, would
negatively affect the Company&#146;s financial performance. Service of the amended
Complaint was thereafter effectuated. On June&nbsp;18, 2008, in response to a Consent
Motion filed on behalf of the Company and Messrs.&nbsp;McGraw and Bahash, the District
Court entered an Order transferring the action to the United States District Court
for the Southern District of New York. A scheduling order has not yet been entered.
The Company believes the litigation to be without merit and intends to vigorously
defend against it.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Three actions were recently filed in New York State Supreme Court, New York County,
naming The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. (&#147;McGraw-Hill&#148; or the &#147;Company&#148;) as a
defendant. The first case, brought by the New Jersey Carpenters Vacation Fund, on
behalf of itself and all others similarly situated, was filed on May&nbsp;14, 2008 and
relates to certain mortgage-backed securities issued by various HarborView Mortgage
Loan Trusts. The second, brought by the New Jersey Carpenters Health Fund, on behalf
of itself and all others similarly situated, was filed on May&nbsp;21, 2008 and relates to
certain mortgage-backed securities issued by various NovaStar Mortgage Funding
Trusts. The third case, brought again by the New Jersey Carpenters Vacation Fund, on
behalf of itself and all others similarly situated, was filed on June&nbsp;3, 2008 and
relates to an October&nbsp;30, 2006 offering by Home Equity Mortgage Trust 2006-5. The
central allegation against the Company in each of these cases is that the Company
issued inappropriate credit ratings on the applicable mortgage-backed securities in
alleged violation of Section&nbsp;11 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1933. In each,
Plaintiff seeks as relief compensatory damages for the alleged decline in value of
the securities, as well as an award of reasonable costs and expenses. Plaintiff has
sued other parties, including the issuers and underwriters of the securities, in each
case as well. All three cases were originally filed in New York State Supreme Court,
New York County and have been subsequently removed to the United States District
Court for the Southern District of New York. Plaintiff is seeking to remand in the three cases, and those motions are in the process of being briefed. The
Company believes the litigations to be without merit and intends to
defend against them vigorously.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On July&nbsp;11, 2008, plaintiff Oddo Asset Management filed an action in New York State
Supreme Court, New York County, against a number of defendants, including the
Company. The action, titled <I>Oddo Asset Management v. Barclays Bank PLC</I>, arises out
of plaintiff&#146;s investment in two structured investment vehicles, or SIV-Lites, that
plaintiff alleges suffered losses as a result of violations of law by those who
created, managed, arranged, and issued credit ratings for those investments.
Plaintiff alleges various common law causes of action against the defendants. The
central allegation against the Company is that it aided and abetted breaches of
fiduciary duty by the collateral managers of the two SIV-Lites by falsely confirming
the credit ratings it had previously given those investments. Plaintiff seeks
compensatory and punitive damages plus reasonable costs, expenses, and attorneys
fees. The Company believes the litigation to be without merit and intends to defend
against it vigorously.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In the second quarter 2008, revenue grew by 6.8% or $17.0&nbsp;million over the prior year
while operating profit increased 68.2% or $10.1&nbsp;million, driven by the
Business-to-Business Group. Foreign exchange rates had an immaterial impact on
segment revenue and operating profit growth.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">At the Business-to-Business Group, revenue increased 7.8% in the second quarter of
2008 as compared to prior year driven by Platts, a leading provider of energy and
other commodities information, as well as J.D. Power and Associates, partially offset
by declines in <I>BusinessWeek</I>.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Oil, natural gas and power news and pricing products experienced growth as the
increased volatility in crude oil and other commodity prices drove the increased need
for market information.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Improved market penetration in the international consumer research studies,
particularly in Asia, positively influenced growth for the Business-to-Business Group
in the second quarter of 2008 over the second quarter of 2007.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In the second quarter of 2008, the dollar value of total U.S. construction starts was
down 17% against the same period of the prior year. Most of the decline was due to
reduced residential building activity, down 38% from the second quarter of 2007.
Nonresidential construction fell 5% from the second quarter of 2007, as a drop in
commercial building activity outweighed gains in the manufacturing sector, while
non-building construction increased 4%.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">According to the Publishing Information Bureau (&#147;PIB&#148;), <I>BusinessWeek&#146;s </I>advertising
pages in the global edition for the second quarter were down 11%, with a comparable
number of issues year to year for PIB purposes and a comparable number of issues for
revenue recognition purposes.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Broadcasting revenue for the quarter declined by 1.0% compared to the second quarter
of 2007 as increases in political advertising were offset by declines in base
advertising due to economic weakness in key markets.

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">





<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In the first six months of 2008 revenue and operating profit declined by 4.1% and
24.7%, respectively. The decrease in revenue and operating profit is primarily
attributable to the decline in the Financial Services segment of 11.0% and 25.4%,
respectively, primarily due to weakness in Credit Market Services. Partially
offsetting the revenue decrease was an increase of 5.1% in the Information &#038; Media
segment driven by the Business-to-Business Group and an increase of 2.2% in
the McGraw-Hill Education segment driven by the School Education Group. Lower 2008
incentive compensation helped mitigate the operating profit decline. Foreign exchange
rates positively impacted both revenue and operating profit by $42.1&nbsp;million and
$11.0&nbsp;million, respectively, during the first six months of 2008.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In the second quarter of 2008, the Company restructured a limited number of business
operations in its Financial Services and McGraw-Hill Education segments to more
efficiently serve its markets and strengthen its long-term growth prospects. The
Company incurred a pre-tax restructuring charge of $23.7&nbsp;million ($14.8&nbsp;million
after-tax, or $0.05 per diluted share), which consisted primarily of severance costs
related to a workforce reduction of 395 positions.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In March&nbsp;2007, the Company sold its mutual fund data business, which was part of the
Financial Services segment. The sale resulted in a $17.3&nbsp;million pre-tax gain ($10.3
million after-tax, or $0.03 per diluted share), recorded as other income. The
divestiture of the mutual fund data business was consistent with the Financial
Services segment&#146;s strategy of directing resources to those businesses which have the
best opportunities to achieve both significant financial growth and market
leadership. The divestiture will enable the Financial Services segment to focus on
its core business of providing independent research, ratings, data, indices and
portfolio services.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Product revenue increased 3.7% in the first six months of 2008, due primarily to
growth in the McGraw-Hill Education and the Information &#038; Media segments.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Product operating-related expenses increased 5.5%, as compared to the first six
months of 2007, primarily due to the growth in expenses at McGraw-Hill Education
related to major product launches in a strong 2008 state adoption market.
Amortization of prepublication costs increased by $9.3&nbsp;million or 10.9%, as compared
with the same period of 2007, as a result of adoption cycles.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Product related selling and general expenses increased 4.1% and product margin
declined 1.0%, as compared to the first six months of 2007, primarily due to the
growth in expenses at McGraw-Hill Education related to major product launches in a
strong 2008 state adoption market.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Service revenue decreased 7.5% in the first six months of 2008 as compared to the
same period of 2007, due primarily to an 11.0% decrease in Financial Services.
Financial Services revenue decreased primarily due to Credit Market Services in light
of the significant declines in the structured finance market resulting from the
current credit problems experienced in the U.S. and in Europe, partially offset by
growth in Investment Services. Additionally, growth in the Information &#038; Media
segment helped partially offset this revenue decline. The service margin decreased
4.9% to 29.7% for the first six months of 2008 primarily due to the decline in Credit
Market Services, partially offset by reduced 2008 incentive compensation expense.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Total expenses in the first six months of 2008 increased $39.2&nbsp;million or 1.7% as
compared to the same period in 2007 driven by increased sales opportunities in the
McGraw-Hill Education segment, and the restructuring charge incurred by the Company
in the second quarter of 2008.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Interest expense increased to $38.2&nbsp;million in the first six months of 2008, as
compared with interest expense of $13.3&nbsp;million for the first half of 2007. The
increase was mainly driven by the impact of $1.2&nbsp;billion in senior notes issued in
the fourth quarter of 2007. Also included in the first six months of 2008 and 2007 is
interest income earned on investment balances.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">For the six months ended June&nbsp;30, 2008 and 2007, the effective tax rate was 37.5% and
37.6%, respectively. The minor decrease in the effective tax rate for the period
ended June&nbsp;30, 2008, compared with the same period during the prior year, is
primarily attributable to the impact of the 2007 divestiture of the mutual fund data
business.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company expects the effective tax rate to be at 37.5% for the remainder of the
year absent the impact of events such as intervening audit settlements, changes in
federal, state or foreign law and changes in the geographical mix of the Company&#146;s
pre-tax income.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Revenue for the McGraw-Hill Education (&#147;MHE&#148;) segment increased 2.2% or $22.0&nbsp;million
from the prior year, while the operating loss grew $10.5&nbsp;million. Results over the
six months reflect the seasonal nature of the Company&#146;s educational publishing
operations, with the first quarter being the least significant, and the third quarter
being the most significant. Foreign exchange rates positively affected revenue by
$9.7&nbsp;million and had an immaterial impact on the operating loss.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">During the second quarter of 2008, the MHE segment incurred a pre-tax restructuring
charge of $8.5&nbsp;million consisting primarily of employee severance costs related to
the reduction of 149 positions, primarily in the assessment business, where MHE is
taking steps to consolidate its resources, better leverage partnerships with key
strategic suppliers, and facilitate a strategic shift toward increased investments in
its digital and custom offerings. Across other parts of the segment, MHE is taking
steps to enable greater efficiencies, better address new and existing revenue
streams, and shift investments toward digital products.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">During the first six months of 2008, revenue for the McGraw-Hill School Education
Group (&#147;SEG&#148;) increased 3.9% or $21.5&nbsp;million compared with the first six months of
2007. The increase was primarily due to strong basal sales of K-5 reading in Florida
and K-5 math in Texas partially offset by lower reorders of workbooks and other
consumable reading materials in several states due to timing and budget concerns.
Total U.S. PreK-12 enrollment for 2007-2008 is estimated at 56&nbsp;million students, up
0.4% from 2006-2007, according to the National Center for Education Statistics
(&#147;NCES&#148;). The total available state new adoption market in 2008 is estimated at
between $900&nbsp;million and $950&nbsp;million compared with approximately $820&nbsp;million in
2007.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The year&#146;s key opportunities in the state new adoption market are primarily offered
by K-5 reading in Florida, K-5 math in Texas, and K-8 math in California. Other
opportunities for 2008 include science in California, reading in Alabama, Indiana,

decision-making largely completed in the adoption states that are buying reading in
2008, the Company expects to capture a majority share of the important Florida K-5
market as well as a major share of the overall K-12 reading/literature state new
adoption market. In the overall K-12 math state new adoption market, the School
Group projects a strong share based on solid results in the K-5 Texas adoption as
well as announced K-8 decisions in California, where some sales activity may continue
into the fall. Despite concerns about the economy in many areas, no state adoptions
scheduled for purchasing in 2008 were cancelled and adoption activity remained brisk
at the district level in most states within this market.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Open territory sales, which have remained flat over the past two years, are projected
to increase modestly due to pent-up demand for new instructional materials. Open
territory net basal sales for the industry remained flat as compared to the prior
year through May&nbsp;2008, the most recent period for which detailed information is
currently available. However, the bulk of open territory purchasing traditionally
occurs in the third quarter. Despite budget pressures, most states have maintained
or increased education funding levels in their new fiscal-year budgets.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">compared to the same period in 2007. The supplementary market has been declining in recent years, in large part because basal
programs are increasingly comprehensive, offering integrated ancillary materials that
reduce the need for separate supplemental products. According to the AAP report, the industry&#146;s
total basal sales increased by 6.0% through May&nbsp;2008, driven by growth in the
adoption states.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In the testing market, SEG&#146;s non-custom or &#147;shelf&#148; testing revenue increased over the
prior year primarily due to increased <I>Acuity </I>revenues in New York City and sales of
the <I>TABE </I>series of assessments for adult learners and the <I>LAS </I>series for
English-language learners, gains which more than offset declines in older products.
Custom contract work decreased in 2008 compared to the same period last year
primarily due to reductions in scope and price on contracts in Florida and Missouri,
partially offset by an increase in scope on a West Virginia contract.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Higher Education revenue declined from the prior-year period, although the Career

retailers cut back on orders and reduced inventory through higher returns. Compared

India, Asia, Canada and the Middle East, partially offset by sales declines in Spain,
Italy and Latin America.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Financial Services revenue and operating profit for the first six months of 2008
decreased 11.0% and 25.4%, respectively, from the same period in 2007. The revenue
and operating profit declines from prior year are mainly due to lower revenue in
Credit Market Services (&#147;CMS&#148;), partially offset by revenue growth in Investment
Services (&#147;IS&#148;). A reduction in 2008 incentive compensation helped mitigate the
operating profit reduction. Foreign exchange positively impacted revenue by $31.6
million and operating profit by $14.4&nbsp;million.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">During the second quarter of 2008, the Financial Services segment incurred a pre-tax
restructuring charge of $15.2&nbsp;million consisting primarily of employee severance
costs related to the reduction of 246 positions, driven by the current credit market
environment as well as the consolidation of several support functions.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In March&nbsp;2007, the Company sold its mutual fund data business, which resulted in a
$17.3&nbsp;million pre-tax gain. Included in IS  in the first six months
of 2007 was $7.8&nbsp;million of revenue relating to this mutual fund data business, with
no comparable amount in the first six months of 2008.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">CMS revenue declined $245.5&nbsp;million or 20.8% from prior year, primarily as a result
of significant decreases in structured finance as well as decreases in corporate
(industrial and financial services) ratings partially offset by increases in public
finance ratings and credit ratings-related information products such as RatingsXpress
and RatingsDirect and credit risk evaluation products and services.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">During the first six months of 2008, significant decreases in issuance volumes in
both the United States and Europe for residential mortgage-backed securities
(&#147;RMBS&#148;), commercial mortgage-backed securities (&#147;CMBS&#148;) and collateralized debt
obligations (&#147;CDO&#148;) contributed to the decrease in revenue. In Europe, a decrease in
issuance volume of asset-backed securities (&#147;ABS&#148;) also contributed to the decrease
in revenue.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Total U.S. structured finance new issue dollar volume decreased 79.0% in the first
six months versus prior year. U.S. CDO issuance decreased 89.7%, according to
Harrison Scott Publications and Standard &#038; Poor&#146;s internal estimates (Harrison Scott
Publications/S&#038;P). The large decline in CDO issuance resulted from continued lack of
investor appetite for the complex deal structures which were in demand in the first
six months of 2007 and secondary market trading liquidity concerns. Continued
deterioration in the subprime mortgage market has significantly impacted dollar
volume issuance in the U.S. RMBS market, which decreased 96.0% compared to prior
year. U.S. CMBS issuance decreased 87.9% over the prior year due to the market
dislocation attributed to high credit spreads resulting in high interest rates which
are not economical to borrowers. U.S. ABS issuance was
flat compared to prior year, driven by a large private placement of $29&nbsp;billion in
the first quarter of 2008. Excluding the impact of this private placement deal, U.S.
ABS was down 18.5% as compared to the same period in 2007. According to Thomson
Financial, U.S. corporate issuance by dollar volume for the first six months of 2008
decreased 22.0%, with investment grade down 13.8% and high yield issuance down 71.5%,
driven by higher credit spreads and decreased merger and acquisition activity.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In Europe for the first six months, structured finance issuance declined 77.9%
compared to the prior year and corporate and government issuance declined 14.6%,
contributing to the revenue decline in CMS. RMBS issuance in Europe decreased 81.3%.
European CDO and CMBS issuance declined 63.7% and 97.2%, respectively, which is also
primarily attributed to higher credit spreads. ABS issuance decreased 63.3% compared
to the prior year.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">IS revenue increased $75.4&nbsp;million or 20.4%, driven by growth in index services and
Capital IQ products. Revenue related to Standard &#038; Poor&#146;s indices increased as
assets under management for exchange-traded funds (&#147;ETF&#148;) rose 15.5% from June&nbsp;30,
2007 to $206.3&nbsp;billion as of June&nbsp;30, 2008 and license fee revenue increased. ETF
assets under management at December&nbsp;31, 2007 were $235.3&nbsp;billion. The number of
exchange-traded futures and option contracts based on S&#038;P indices exhibited strong
increases in the first six months of 2008 compared to the same period of the prior
year, thereby also contributing to the revenue growth. The number of Capital IQ
clients increased 23% from the second quarter end of 2007 to second quarter end of
2008.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Because of the current credit market conditions, issuance levels deteriorated
significantly across all asset classes. It is possible that the current market
conditions and global issuance levels in structured finance could persist through
2008. The outlook for RMBS, CMBS and CDO asset classes as well as other asset
classes is dependent upon many factors, including the general condition of the
economy, interest rates, credit quality and spreads, and the level of liquidity in
the financial markets.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The financial services industry is subject to the potential for increased regulation
in the United States and abroad. The businesses conducted by the Financial Services
segment are in certain cases regulated under the Credit Rating Agency Reform Act of
2006, U.S. Investment Advisers Act of 1940, the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934
and/or the laws of the states or other jurisdictions in which they conduct business.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Standard &#038; Poor&#146;s Ratings Services is a credit rating agency that is registered with
the Securities and Exchange Commission (&#147;SEC&#148;) as one of ten Nationally Recognized
Statistical Rating Organizations, or NRSROs. The SEC first began designating NRSROs
in 1975 for use of their credit ratings in the determination of capital charges for
registered brokers and dealers under the SEC&#146;s Net Capital Rule.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Credit rating agency legislation entitled &#147;Credit Rating Agency Reform Act of 2006&#148;
(the &#147;Act&#148;) was signed into law on September&nbsp;29, 2006. The Act created a new SEC
registration system for rating agencies that volunteer to be recognized as NRSROs.
Under the Act, the SEC is given authority and oversight of NRSROs and can censure
NRSROs, revoke their registration or limit or suspend their registration in certain
cases. The SEC is not authorized to review the analytical process, ratings criteria
or methodology of the NRSROs. An agency&#146;s decision to register and comply with the
Act will not constitute a waiver of or diminish any right, defense or privilege
available under applicable law. Pre-emption language is included in the Act
consistent with other legal precedent. The Company does not believe the Act will
have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The SEC issued rules to implement the Act, effective June&nbsp;2007. Standard &#038; Poor&#146;s
submitted its application on Form&nbsp;NRSRO on June&nbsp;25, 2007. On September&nbsp;24, 2007, the
SEC granted Standard &#038; Poor&#146;s registration as an NRSRO under the Act. In March&nbsp;2008,
S&#038;P filed its first annual update of its registration with the SEC. The public
portions of S&#038;P&#146;s Form&nbsp;NRSRO are available on S&#038;P&#146;s website.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On June&nbsp;16, 2008, the SEC issued proposed rules that focus largely on NRSROs&#146;
structured finance ratings process. The proposed rules address a broad range of
issues, including disclosure and management of conflicts related to the issuer-pays
model, prohibitions against analysts&#146; accepting gifts or making &#147;recommendations&#148;

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">security, and limitations on analyst participation in fee discussions. Under the proposed rules, additional records of all rating actions must be created,
retained and made public, and records must be kept of material deviations in ratings
assigned from model outputs as well as complaints about analysts&#146; performance. The
proposals require more disclosure of performance statistics and methodologies, a new
annual report by NRSROs of their rating actions to be provided confidentially to the
SEC, and unless structured finance ratings are distinguished from other ratings, NRSROs will be required to issue a report describing the differences for each
structured rating. The deadline for comments was July 25, 2008. S&#038;P submitted comments on the proposals. The Company believes that some of the proposals raise serious legal issues. On July&nbsp;1, 2008, the SEC also proposed changes to numerous SEC
rules and forms that expressly utilize NRSRO ratings. The deadline for comments is
September&nbsp;5, 2008. S&#038;P currently plans to submit comments on some of the SEC&#146;s key
proposals.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In the third quarter of 2007, rating agencies became subject to scrutiny for their
ratings on structured finance transactions that involve the packaging of subprime
residential mortgages, including residential mortgage-backed securities (&#147;RMBS&#148;) and
collateralized debt obligations (&#147;CDOs&#148;).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On August&nbsp;29, 2007, Standard &#038; Poor&#146;s received a subpoena from the New York Attorney
General&#146;s Office requesting information and documents relating to Standard &#038; Poor&#146;s
ratings of securities backed by residential real estate mortgages. Standard &#038; Poor&#146;s
has entered into an agreement with the New York Attorney General&#146;s Office which calls
for S&#038;P to implement certain structural reforms. The agreement resolves the Attorney
General&#146;s investigation with no monetary payment and no admission of wrongdoing.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In September&nbsp;2007, the SEC commenced an examination of rating agencies&#146; policies and
procedures regarding conflicts of interest and the application of those policies and
procedures to ratings on RMBS and related CDOs. Standard &#038; Poor&#146;s is cooperating
with the SEC staff in connection with this examination. The SEC issued its public
Report on July&nbsp;8, 2008. The SEC findings and recommendations addressed the
following subjects: (a)&nbsp;the SEC noted there was a substantial increase in the number
and complexity of RMBS and CDO deals since 2002, and some rating agencies appeared to
struggle with the growth; (b)&nbsp;significant aspects of the rating process were not
always disclosed; (c)&nbsp;policies and procedures for rating RMBS and CDOs could be
better documented; (d)&nbsp;the implementation of new practices by ratings agencies with
respect to the information provided to them; (e)&nbsp;rating agencies did not always
document significant steps in the ratings process and they did not always document
significant participants in the ratings process; (f)&nbsp;the surveillance processes used
by the rating agencies appear to have been less robust than their initial ratings
processes; (g)&nbsp;issues were identified in the management of conflicts of interest and
improvements could be made; and (h)&nbsp;internal audit processes. S&#038;P has advised the SEC
it will be taking steps to enhance S&#038;P&#146;s policies and procedures consistent with the
SEC&#146;s recommendations.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On October&nbsp;16, 2007, Standard &#038; Poor&#146;s received a subpoena from the Connecticut
Attorney General&#146;s Office requesting information and documents relating to the
conduct of Standard &#038; Poor&#146;s credit ratings business. The subpoena appears to relate
to an investigation by the Connecticut Attorney General into whether Standard &#038;
Poor&#146;s, in the conduct of its credit ratings business, violated the Connecticut
Antitrust Act. Subsequently, a second subpoena dated December&nbsp;6, 2007, seeking
information and documents relating to the rating of securities backed by residential
real estate mortgages, and a third subpoena dated January&nbsp;14, 2008, seeking
information and documents relating to the rating of municipal and corporate debt,
were served. The Attorney General&#146;s Office has also indicated that its investigation
is looking into whether Standard &#038; Poor&#146;s may have violated the Connecticut Unfair
Trade Practices Act. The Company is responding to the subpoenas.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Outside the United States, particularly in Europe, regulators and government

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">consultation process. S&#038;P and other global rating agencies contributed to this process. S&#038;P has started to implement many
of IOSCO&#146;s recommendations and expects to update its Code of Conduct as appropriate.
In May&nbsp;2008, CESR issued its second report to the European Commission on rating
agencies&#146; compliance with IOSCO&#146;s original Code of Conduct, the role of rating
agencies in structured finance and recommendations for, among other things,
additional monitoring and oversight of rating agencies. CESR also requested public
comments during a consultation period leading up to the final report. In June&nbsp;2008,
the European Securities Markets Expert Group (ESME), a group of senior practitioners
and advisors to the European Commission, issued its report on the role of rating
agencies and a separate set of recommendations. S&#038;P engaged with ESME during its review process.
The European review of rating agencies and potential additional oversight is expected
to continue into the fall and, possibly, 2009.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Other regulatory developments include: a March&nbsp;2008 report by the President&#146;s Working
Group on Financial Markets that includes recommendations relating to rating agencies;
an April&nbsp;2008 report by the Financial Stability Forum that recommends changes in the
role and uses of credit ratings; and a July&nbsp;2008 report by the Committee on the
Global Financial System (Bank for International Settlements) on ratings in structured
finance. S&#038;P expects to continue to be involved in the follow up to these reports.
In many countries, S&#038;P is also an External Credit Assessment Institution (ECAI)&nbsp;under
Basel II for purposes of allowing banks to use its ratings in determining risk
weightings for many credit exposures. Recognized ECAIs may be subject to additional
oversight in the future.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">New legislation, regulations or judicial determinations applicable to credit rating
agencies in the United States and abroad could affect the competitive position of
Standard &#038; Poor&#146;s Ratings Services; however, the Company does not believe that any
new or currently proposed legislation, regulations or judicial determinations would
have a materially adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The market for credit ratings as well as research and investment advisory services is
very competitive. The Financial Services segment competes domestically and
internationally on the basis of a number of factors, including quality of ratings,
research and investment advice, client service, reputation, price, geographic scope,
range of products and technological innovation. In addition, in some of the
countries in which Standard &#038; Poor&#146;s competes, governments may provide financial or
other support to locally-based rating agencies and may from time to time establish
official credit rating agencies, credit ratings criteria or procedures for evaluating
local issuers.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">A writ of summons was served on The McGraw-Hill Companies, SRL and on The McGraw-Hill
Companies, SA (both indirect subsidiaries of the Company) (collectively, &#147;Standard &#038;
Poor&#146;s&#148;) on September&nbsp;29, 2005 and October&nbsp;7, 2005, respectively, in an action
brought in the Tribunal of Milan, Italy by Enrico Bondi (&#147;Bondi&#148;), the Extraordinary
Commissioner of Parmalat Finanziaria S.p.A. and Parmalat S.p.A. (collectively,
&#147;Parmalat&#148;). Bondi has brought numerous other lawsuits in both Italy and the United
States against entities and individuals who had dealings with Parmalat. In this
suit, Bondi claims that Standard &#038; Poor&#146;s, which had issued investment grade ratings
on Parmalat until shortly before Parmalat&#146;s collapse in December&nbsp;2003, breached its
duty to issue an independent and professional rating and negligently and knowingly
assigned inflated ratings in order to retain Parmalat&#146;s business. Alleging joint and
several liability, Bondi claims damages of euros 4,073,984,120 (representing the
value of bonds issued by Parmalat and the rating fees paid by Parmalat) with
interest, plus damages to be ascertained for Standard &#038; Poor&#146;s alleged complicity in
aggravating Parmalat&#146;s financial difficulties and/or for having contributed in
bringing about Parmalat&#146;s indebtedness towards its bondholders, and legal fees. The
Company believes that Bondi&#146;s allegations and claims for damages lack legal or
factual merit. Standard &#038; Poor&#146;s filed its answer, counterclaim and third-party
claims on March&nbsp;16, 2006 and will continue to vigorously contest the action.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In a separate proceeding, the prosecutor&#146;s office in Parma, Italy is conducting an
investigation into the bankruptcy of Parmalat. In June&nbsp;2006, the prosecutor&#146;s office
issued a Note of Completion of an Investigation (&#147;Note of Completion&#148;) concerning
allegations, based on Standard &#038; Poor&#146;s investment grade ratings of Parmalat, that
individual Standard &#038; Poor&#146;s rating analysts conspired with Parmalat insiders and
rating advisors to fraudulently or negligently cause the Parmalat bankruptcy. The
Note of Completion was served on eight Standard &#038; Poor&#146;s rating analysts. While not
a formal charge, the Note of Completion indicates the prosecutor&#146;s intention that the
named rating analysts should appear before a judge in Parma for a preliminary
hearing, at which hearing the judge will determine whether there is sufficient
evidence against the rating analysts to proceed to trial. No date has been set for
the preliminary hearing. On July&nbsp;7, 2006, a defense brief was filed with the Parma
prosecutor&#146;s office on behalf of the rating analysts. The Company believes that
there is no basis in fact or law to support the allegations against the rating
analysts, and they will be vigorously defended by the subsidiaries involved.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company learned on August&nbsp;9, 2007 that a pro se action titled <I>Blomquist v.

of California against numerous financial institutions, government agencies and

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">various state and federal claims. The claims against the Company and Mr.
McGraw concern Standard &#038; Poor&#146;s ratings of subprime mortgage-backed securities. An
amended Complaint was filed in the <I>Blomquist </I>action on September&nbsp;10, 2007 which added
two other rating agencies as defendants. On February&nbsp;19, 2008 the Company was served
with the Complaint and, on February&nbsp;29, 2008, Mr.&nbsp;McGraw was served with the
Complaint. On May&nbsp;12, 2008, the Company and Mr.&nbsp;McGraw filed a motion to dismiss all
claims asserted against them. Similar motions were filed by other defendants.
Plaintiff filed papers opposing the motions on July&nbsp;1, 2008. A hearing on the motions was held on July 11, 2008 and, by Order dated July 23, 2008, the Court dismissed all claims asserted against the Company and Mr. McGraw and denied plaintiff leave to amend as against them.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company also learned that on August&nbsp;28, 2007 a putative shareholder class action
titled <I>Reese v. Bahash </I>was filed in the District Court for the District of Columbia
against Mr.&nbsp;Robert Bahash, the CFO of the Company, alleging claims under the federal
securities laws and state tort law concerning Standard &#038; Poor&#146;s ratings, particularly
its ratings of subprime mortgage-backed securities. Mr.&nbsp;Bahash was not served with
the Complaint. On February&nbsp;11, 2008, the District Court in the <I>Reese </I>matter entered
an order appointing a lead plaintiff in that action and permitting plaintiffs to
amend the Complaint on or before April&nbsp;16, 2008. On April&nbsp;7, 2008, the District
Court granted the application of the lead plaintiff to extend the deadline for its
amendment of the Complaint to May&nbsp;7, 2008. On May&nbsp;7, 2008 an amended Complaint was
filed alleging violations of the federal securities laws; the Company and Mr.&nbsp;McGraw
were named as additional defendants. The amended Complaint asserts, among other
things, that the defendants failed to warn investors that problems in the structured
finance market, particularly the sub-prime lending market, would negatively affect
the Company&#146;s financial performance. Service of the amended Complaint was thereafter
effectuated. On June&nbsp;18, 2008, in response to a Consent Motion filed on behalf of
the Company and Messrs.&nbsp;McGraw and Bahash, the District Court entered an Order
transferring the action to the United States District Court for the Southern District
of New York. A scheduling order has not yet been entered. The Company believes the
litigation to be without merit and intends to vigorously defend against it.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Three actions were recently filed in New York State Supreme Court, New York County,
naming The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. (&#147;McGraw-Hill&#148; or the &#147;Company&#148;) as a
defendant. The first case, brought by the New Jersey Carpenters Vacation Fund, on
behalf of itself and all others similarly situated, was filed on May&nbsp;14, 2008 and
relates to certain mortgage-backed securities issued by various HarborView Mortgage
Loan Trusts. The second, brought by the New Jersey Carpenters Health Fund, on behalf
of itself and all others similarly situated, was filed on May&nbsp;21, 2008 and relates to
certain mortgage-backed securities issued by various NovaStar Mortgage Funding
Trusts. The third case, brought again by the New Jersey Carpenters Vacation Fund, on
behalf of itself and all others similarly situated, was filed on June&nbsp;3, 2008 and
relates to an October&nbsp;30, 2006 offering by Home Equity Mortgage Trust 2006-5. The
central allegation against the Company in each of these cases is that the Company
issued inappropriate credit ratings on the applicable mortgage-backed securities in
alleged violation of Section&nbsp;11 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1933. In each,
Plaintiff seeks as relief compensatory damages for the alleged decline in value of
the securities, as well as an award of reasonable costs and expenses. Plaintiff has
sued other parties, including the issuers and underwriters of the securities, in each
case as well. All three cases were originally filed in New York State Supreme Court,
New York County and have been subsequently removed to the United States District
Court for the Southern District of New York. Plaintiff is seeking to remand in the three cases, and those motions are in the process of being briefed. The
Company believes the litigations to be without merit and intends to
defend against them vigorously.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On July&nbsp;11, 2008, plaintiff Oddo Asset Management filed an action in New York State
Supreme Court, New York County, against a number of defendants, including the
Company. The action, titled <I>Oddo Asset Management v. Barclays Bank PLC</I>, arises out
of plaintiff&#146;s investment in two structured investment vehicles, or SIV-Lites, that
plaintiff alleges suffered losses as a result of violations of law by those who
created, managed, arranged, and issued credit ratings for those investments.
Plaintiff alleges various common law causes of action against the defendants. The
central allegation against the Company is that it aided and abetted breaches of
fiduciary duty by the collateral managers of the two SIV-Lites by falsely confirming
the credit ratings it had previously given those investments. Plaintiff seeks
compensatory and punitive damages plus reasonable costs, expenses, and attorneys
fees. The Company believes the litigation to be without merit and intends to defend
against it vigorously.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In addition, in the normal course of business both in the United States and abroad,
the Company and its subsidiaries are defendants in numerous legal proceedings and are
involved, from time to time, in governmental and self-regulatory agency proceedings,
which may result in adverse judgments, damages, fines or penalties. Also, various
governmental and self-regulatory agencies regularly make inquiries and conduct
investigations concerning compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Based on
information currently known by the Company&#146;s management, the Company does not believe
that any pending legal, governmental or self-regulatory proceedings or investigations
will result in a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of
operations.

year while operating profit increased 48.3% or $11.9&nbsp;million, driven by the
Business-to-Business Group. Foreign exchange rates had an immaterial impact on
segment revenue and a negative impact of $2.1&nbsp;million on segment operating profit
growth.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">At the Business-to-Business Group, revenue increased 5.7% or $24.8&nbsp;million in the
first six months of 2008 as compared to prior year driven by Platts, a leading
provider of energy and other commodities information, as well as J.D. Power and
Associates, partially offset by declines in <I>BusinessWeek</I>.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Oil, natural gas and power news and pricing products experienced growth as the
increased volatility in crude oil and other commodity prices drove the increased need
for market information.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Improved market penetration of international consumer research studies, particularly
in Asia, positively influenced growth for the Business-to-Business Group in the first
six months of 2008 over the first half of 2007.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In the first six months of 2008, the dollar value of total U.S. construction starts
was down 16% compared to the same period of the prior year. Most of the decline was
due to reduced residential building activity, down 39% from the first half of 2007.
Nonresidential construction was up 6% from the first half of 2007 as gains in the
manufacturing sector outweighed a drop in commercial building activity, while
non-building construction slipped 3%.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">According to the Publishing Information Bureau (&#147;PIB&#148;), <I>BusinessWeek&#146;s </I>advertising
pages in the global edition for the first six months were down 15%, with comparable
number of issues year to year for PIB purposes and comparable number of issues for
revenue recognition purposes. The Company continues to make investments in the
<I>BusinessWeek.com </I>brand.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Broadcasting revenue for the first six months was flat compared to the same period of
the prior year as increases in political advertising were offset by declines in base
advertising due to economic weakness in key markets.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company continues to maintain a strong financial position. The Company&#146;s primary
source of funds for operations is cash generated by operating activities. The
Company&#146;s core businesses have been strong cash generators. Income and, consequently,
cash provided from operations during the year are significantly impacted by the
seasonality of businesses, particularly educational publishing. This seasonality also
impacts cash flow and related borrowing patterns. The Company&#146;s cash flow is
typically weaker in the first half of the year and strengthens during the third and
fourth quarters. Debt financing is used as necessary for share repurchases, seasonal
fluctuations in working capital and acquisitions. Cash and cash equivalents were
$355.3&nbsp;million at June&nbsp;30, 2008, a decrease of $40.8&nbsp;million from December&nbsp;31, 2007.
Most of the cash and equivalents as of June&nbsp;30, 2008 are held outside the United
States. The Company&#146;s subsidiaries maintain cash balances at financial institutions
located throughout the world. These cash balances are subject to normal currency
exchange fluctuations. Typically, cash held outside the U.S. is anticipated to be
utilized to fund international operations or to be reinvested outside the U.S. as a
significant portion of the Company&#146;s opportunities for growth in the coming years are
expected to be abroad.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Cash Flow
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Operating Activities: Cash provided by operations was $37.4&nbsp;million for the first six
months of 2008, as compared to $388.5&nbsp;million during the same period in 2007. The
decrease in cash from operating activities from the prior year is primarily the
result of a decline in income from operations as well as decreases in accounts
payable and accrued expenses.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">As of June&nbsp;30, 2008, accounts receivable (before reserves) increased $77.4&nbsp;million
from the prior year-end, primarily due to the seasonality of the educational business
and growth in the Information &#038; Media segment. This increase compares to a $49.7
million increase in 2007. Year-to-date, the number of days sales outstanding for
operations have increased by 2&nbsp;days year over year, primarily due to the Financial
Services segment, particularly related to declines in structured finance
transactions. Inventories increased by $143.1&nbsp;million from the end of 2007 as the
Company&#146;s education business prepares for its selling season. The increase in
inventories over the prior year is primarily the result of the stronger adoption
opportunities in 2008 compared with 2007.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Accounts payable and accrued expenses decreased by $324.6&nbsp;million versus year-end
primarily due to the timing of performance based compensation payments in the first
quarter of 2008, and a reduction in 2008 incentive compensation accruals. This
decrease compares to a $187.4&nbsp;million decrease in 2007.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Investing Activities: Cash used for investing activities was $225.3&nbsp;million and
$208.8&nbsp;million in the first six months of 2008 and 2007, respectively. The increase
over the prior year is primarily due to increased investment in technology projects
in the first half of 2008 as compared to 2007, and the disposition of the mutual fund
data business in the first quarter of 2007.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Purchases of property and equipment totaled $48.8&nbsp;million in the first six months of
2008 compared with $83.4&nbsp;million in 2007. For 2008, capital expenditures are expected
to be approximately $160&nbsp;million and primarily relate to increased investment in the
Company&#146;s information technology data centers and other technology initiatives.

2007, as spending outpaced amortization. Prepublication investment in the current
year totaled $131.9&nbsp;million as of June&nbsp;30, 2008, in line with the same period in
2007. Prepublication investment for 2008 is expected to be approximately $270
million, reflecting new product development in light of the significant adoption
opportunities in key states in 2008 and beyond.

June&nbsp;30, 2008 compared to cash used for financing activities of $182.7&nbsp;million in for
the same period in 2007. The difference is primarily attributable to the reduced
share repurchases in 2008 partially offset by a reduction of $465.6&nbsp;million in
borrowings of commercial paper. In 2008, cash was utilized to repurchase
approximately 6.7&nbsp;million shares for $275.5&nbsp;million on a settlement date basis. An
additional 0.7&nbsp;million shares were repurchased in the second quarter of 2008 for
$29.2&nbsp;million, which settled in July&nbsp;2008. In 2007, cash was utilized to repurchase
approximately 18.1&nbsp;million shares for $1,178.3&nbsp;million on a settlement basis. An
additional 1.4&nbsp;million shares were repurchased in the second quarter of 2007 for
$95.6&nbsp;million, which settled in July&nbsp;2007. Shares repurchased under the repurchase
program were used for general corporate purposes, including the issuance of shares
for stock compensation plans and to offset the dilutive effect of the exercise of
employee stock options.

outstanding as of June&nbsp;30, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Commercial paper borrowings
are supported by the Company&#146;s five-year revolving credit facility agreement of $1.2
billion which expires on July&nbsp;20, 2009. The Company pays a facility fee of seven
basis points on the credit facility whether or not amounts have been borrowed, and
borrowings may be made at a spread of 13 basis points above the prevailing LIBOR
rates. This spread increases to 18 basis points for borrowings exceeding 50% of the
total capacity available under the facility. The facility contains certain
covenants, and the only financial covenant requires that the Company not exceed
indebtedness to cash flow ratio, as defined, of 4 to 1 at any time. This restriction
has never been exceeded. There were no borrowings under this agreement as of June&nbsp;30,
2008 and 2007.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company also has the capacity to issue Extendible Commercial Notes (&#147;ECNs&#148;) of up
to $240&nbsp;million. ECNs replicate commercial paper, except that the Company has an
option to extend the note beyond its initial redemption date to a maximum final
maturity of 390&nbsp;days. However, if exercised, such an extension is at a higher reset
rate, which is at a predetermined spread over LIBOR and is related to the Company&#146;s
commercial paper rating at the time of extension. As a result of the extension
option, no backup facilities for these borrowings are required. As is the

terms (principal, interest rate and maturity date) of each borrowing governed by this
promissory note will be determined on the borrowing date of each loan. There were no

approximately 12.7% of the total shares of the Company&#146;s outstanding common stock at
that time. The repurchased shares may be used for general corporate purposes,
including the issuance of shares in connection with the exercise of employee stock
options. Purchases under this program may be made from time to time on the open
market and in private transactions depending on market conditions. At December&nbsp;31,
2007, authorization for the repurchase of 28&nbsp;million shares remained under the 2007
program. The Company repurchased 7.4&nbsp;million shares (on a trade date basis) from the
2007 program during the first six months of 2008 for $304.8&nbsp;million at an average

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign exchange rates. The
Company has operations in various foreign countries. For most international
operations, the functional currency is the local currency. For international
operations that are determined to be extensions of the Parent Company, the U.S.
dollar is the functional currency. For hyper-inflationary economies, the functional
currency is the U.S. dollar. In the normal course of business, these operations are
exposed to fluctuations in currency values. The Company does not generally enter into
derivative financial instruments in the normal course of business, nor are such
instruments used for speculative purposes. The Company has no such instruments
outstanding at this time.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company has naturally hedged positions in most countries from a local currency
perspective with offsetting assets and liabilities. The gross amount of the Company&#146;s
foreign exchange balance sheet exposure from operations is $168.9&nbsp;million as of June
30, 2008. Management has estimated using an undiversified average value-at-risk
analysis with a 95% confidence level that the foreign exchange gains and losses
should not exceed $15.9&nbsp;million over the next year based on the historical
volatilities of the portfolio.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">A writ of summons was served on The McGraw-Hill Companies, SRL and on The McGraw-Hill
Companies, SA (both indirect subsidiaries of the Company) (collectively, &#147;Standard &#038;
Poor&#146;s&#148;) on September&nbsp;29, 2005 and October&nbsp;7, 2005, respectively, in an action
brought in the Tribunal of Milan, Italy by Enrico Bondi (&#147;Bondi&#148;), the Extraordinary
Commissioner of Parmalat Finanziaria S.p.A. and Parmalat S.p.A. (collectively,
&#147;Parmalat&#148;). Bondi has brought numerous other lawsuits in both Italy and the United
States against entities and individuals who had dealings with Parmalat. In this
suit, Bondi claims that Standard &#038; Poor&#146;s, which had issued investment grade ratings
on Parmalat until shortly before Parmalat&#146;s collapse in December&nbsp;2003, breached its
duty to issue an independent and professional rating and negligently and knowingly
assigned inflated ratings in order to retain Parmalat&#146;s business. Alleging joint and
several liability, Bondi claims damages of euros 4,073,984,120 (representing the
value of bonds issued by Parmalat and the rating fees paid by Parmalat) with
interest, plus damages to be ascertained for Standard &#038; Poor&#146;s alleged complicity in
aggravating Parmalat&#146;s financial difficulties and/or for having contributed in
bringing about Parmalat&#146;s indebtedness towards its bondholders, and legal fees. The
Company believes that Bondi&#146;s allegations and claims for damages lack legal or
factual merit. Standard &#038; Poor&#146;s filed its answer, counterclaim and third-party
claims on March&nbsp;16, 2006 and will continue to vigorously contest the action.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In a separate proceeding, the prosecutor&#146;s office in Parma, Italy is conducting an
investigation into the bankruptcy of Parmalat. In June&nbsp;2006, the prosecutor&#146;s office
issued a Note of Completion of an Investigation (&#147;Note of Completion&#148;) concerning
allegations, based on Standard &#038; Poor&#146;s investment grade ratings of Parmalat, that
individual Standard &#038; Poor&#146;s rating analysts conspired with Parmalat insiders and
rating advisors to fraudulently or negligently cause the Parmalat bankruptcy. The
Note of Completion was served on eight Standard &#038; Poor&#146;s rating analysts. While not a
formal charge, the Note of Completion indicates the prosecutor&#146;s intention that the
named rating analysts should appear before a judge in Parma for a preliminary
hearing, at which hearing the judge will determine whether there is sufficient
evidence against the rating analysts to proceed to trial. No date has been set for
the preliminary hearing. On July&nbsp;7, 2006, a defense brief was filed with the Parma
prosecutor&#146;s office on behalf of the rating analysts. The Company believes that
there is no basis in fact or law to support the allegations against the rating
analysts, and they will be vigorously defended by the subsidiaries involved.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company learned on August&nbsp;9, 2007 that a pro se action titled <I>Blomquist v.
Washington Mutual</I>, et al., was filed in the District Court for the Northern District
of California against numerous financial institutions, government agencies and
individuals, including the Company and Mr.&nbsp;Harold McGraw III, the CEO of the Company,
alleging various state and federal claims. The claims against the Company and Mr.
McGraw concern Standard &#038; Poor&#146;s ratings of subprime mortgage-backed securities. An
amended Complaint was filed in the <I>Blomquist </I>action on September&nbsp;10, 2007 which added
two other rating agencies as defendants. On February&nbsp;19, 2008 the Company was served
with the Complaint and, on February&nbsp;29, 2008, Mr.&nbsp;McGraw was served with the
Complaint. On May&nbsp;12, 2008, the Company and Mr.&nbsp;McGraw filed a motion to dismiss all
claims asserted against them. Similar motions were filed by other defendants.
Plaintiff filed papers opposing the motions on July&nbsp;1, 2008. A hearing on the motions was held on July 11, 2008 and, by Order dated July 23, 2008, the Court dismissed all claims asserted against the Company and Mr. McGraw and denied plaintiff leave to amend as against them.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company also learned that on August&nbsp;28, 2007 a putative shareholder class
action titled <I>Reese v. Bahash </I>was filed in the District Court for the District of
Columbia against Mr.&nbsp;Robert Bahash, the CFO of the Company, alleging claims under the
federal securities laws and state tort law concerning Standard &#038; Poor&#146;s ratings,
particularly its ratings of subprime mortgage-backed securities. Mr.&nbsp;Bahash was not
served with the Complaint. On February&nbsp;11, 2008, the District Court in the <I>Reese</I>
matter entered an order appointing a lead plaintiff in that action and permitting
plaintiffs to amend the Complaint on or before April&nbsp;16, 2008. On April&nbsp;7, 2008, the
District Court granted the application of the lead plaintiff to extend the deadline
for its amendment of the Complaint to May&nbsp;7, 2008. On May&nbsp;7, 2008 an amended
Complaint was filed alleging violations of the federal securities laws; the Company
and Mr.&nbsp;McGraw were named as additional defendants. The amended Complaint asserts,
among other things, that the defendants failed to warn investors that problems in the
structured finance market, particularly the sub-prime lending market, would
negatively affect the Company&#146;s financial performance. Service of the amended
Complaint was thereafter effectuated. On June&nbsp;18, 2008, in response to a Consent
Motion filed on behalf of the Company and Messrs.&nbsp;McGraw and Bahash, the District
Court entered an Order transferring the action to the United States District Court
for the Southern District of New York. A scheduling order has not yet been entered.
The Company believes the litigation to be without merit and intends to vigorously
defend against it.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Three actions were recently filed in New York State Supreme Court, New York County,
naming The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. (&#147;McGraw-Hill&#148; or the &#147;Company&#148;) as a
defendant. The first case, brought by the New Jersey Carpenters Vacation Fund, on
behalf of itself and all others similarly situated, was filed on May&nbsp;14, 2008 and
relates to certain mortgage-backed securities issued by various HarborView Mortgage
Loan Trusts. The second, brought by the New Jersey Carpenters Health Fund, on behalf
of itself and all others similarly situated, was filed on May&nbsp;21, 2008 and relates to
certain mortgage-backed securities issued by various NovaStar Mortgage Funding
Trusts. The third case, brought again by the New Jersey Carpenters Vacation Fund, on
behalf of itself and all others similarly situated, was filed on June&nbsp;3, 2008 and
relates to an October&nbsp;30, 2006 offering by Home Equity Mortgage Trust 2006-5. The
central allegation against the Company in each of these cases is that the Company
issued inappropriate credit ratings on the applicable mortgage-backed securities in
alleged violation of Section&nbsp;11 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1933. In each,
Plaintiff seeks as relief compensatory damages for the alleged decline in value of
the securities, as well as an award of reasonable costs and expenses. Plaintiff has
sued other parties, including the issuers and underwriters of the securities, in each
case as well. All three cases were originally filed in New York State Supreme Court,
New York County and have been subsequently removed to the United States District
Court for the Southern District of New York. Plaintiff is seeking to remand in the three cases, and those motions are in the process of being briefed. The
Company believes the litigations to be without merit and intends to
defend against them vigorously.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On July&nbsp;11, 2008, plaintiff Oddo Asset Management filed an action in New York State
Supreme Court, New York County, against a number of defendants, including the
Company. The action, titled <I>Oddo Asset Management v. Barclays Bank PLC</I>, arises out
of plaintiff&#146;s investment in two structured investment vehicles, or SIV-Lites, that
plaintiff alleges suffered losses as a result of violations of law by those who
created, managed, arranged, and issued credit ratings for those investments.
Plaintiff alleges various common law causes of action against the defendants. The
central allegation against the Company is that it aided and abetted breaches of
fiduciary duty by the collateral managers of the two SIV-Lites by falsely confirming
the credit ratings it had previously given those investments. Plaintiff seeks
compensatory and punitive damages plus reasonable costs, expenses, and attorneys
fees. The Company believes the litigation to be without merit and intends to defend
against it vigorously.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In addition, in the normal course of business both in the United States and abroad,
the Company and its subsidiaries are defendants in numerous legal proceedings and are
involved, from time to time, in governmental and self-regulatory agency proceedings,
which may result in adverse judgments, damages, fines or penalties. Also, various
governmental and self-regulatory agencies regularly make inquiries and conduct
investigations concerning compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Based on
information currently known by the Company&#146;s management, the Company does not believe
that any pending legal, governmental or self-regulatory proceedings or investigations
will result in a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of
operations.
