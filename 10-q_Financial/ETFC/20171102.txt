MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this document and with the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016. OVERVIEWCompany OverviewE*TRADE is a financial services company that provides online brokerage and related products and services primarily to individual retail investors. Our mission is to enhance the financial independence of traders and investors through a powerful digital offering and professional guidance. Our vision is to be the #1 digital broker and advisor to traders and investors, known for ease of use and the completeness of our offering. StrategyOur business strategy is centered on two key objectives: accelerating the growth of our core brokerage business to drive organic growth and improve competitive position, and generating robust earnings growth and healthy returns on capital to deliver long-term value for our stakeholders. Accelerate Growth of Core Brokerage Business•Enhance overall customer experienceWe are focused on delivering cutting-edge trading solutions while improving our market position in investing products. Through these offerings, we aim to drive customer acquisition while deepening engagement with our existing customers.•Capitalize on value of corporate services channelWe leverage our industry-leading position in corporate stock plan administration to improve client acquisition and engage with plan participants to bolster awareness of our full suite of offerings. Our corporate services channel is a strategically important driver of brokerage account and asset growth.Generate Robust Earnings Growth and Healthy Returns on Capital•Utilize balance sheet to enhance returnsWe utilize our bank structure to effectively monetize brokerage relationships by investing stable, low-cost deposits primarily in agency mortgage-backed securities. •Put capital to work for shareholdersWe have put significant capital to work through balance sheet growth, share repurchases and acquisition activity. We are focused on generating and effectively deploying capital for the benefit of our shareholders.Financial PerformanceOur net revenue is generated primarily from net interest income, commissions and fees and service charges. Net interest income is largely impacted by the size of our balance sheet, our balance sheet mix, and average yields on our assets and liabilities. Net interest income is driven primarily from interest earned on investment securities and margin receivables, less interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities, including deposits, customer E*TRADE | Q3 2017 10-Q  2  Table of Contents payables, corporate debt and other borrowings. Net interest income is also earned on our legacy mortgage and consumer loan portfolio which we expect to continue to run off in future periods. Commissions revenue is generated by customer trades and is largely impacted by trade volume and commission rates. Fees and service charges revenue is mainly impacted by order flow revenue, fees earned on off-balance sheet customer cash and other assets, and advisor management fees. Our net revenue is offset by non-interest expenses, the largest of which are compensation and benefits and advertising and market development.Significant Events in the Third Quarter of 2017Announced Trust Company of America acquisitionOn October 19, 2017, we announced an agreement to acquire Trust Company of America, Inc. (TCA), a leading provider of technology solutions and custody services to the registered investment adviser market, for $275 million in cash. We anticipate funding the transaction through the issuance of non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock. The acquisition is expected to close in the second quarter of 2018, subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals.Completed OptionsHouse integrationIn August 2017, we completed the integration of Aperture, LLC (dba OptionsHouse), which was acquired by the Company in 2016. Completion of the integration included the rollout of OptionsHouse features and functionality through E*TRADE.com and the transfer of retail brokerage accounts and customer-related balances of OptionsHouse to E*TRADE Securities LLC (E*TRADE Securities). Futures accounts and balances of E*TRADE Securities were transferred to E*TRADE Futures LLC (formerly known as Aperture, LLC).Issued $1 billion of senior notes and redeemed higher cost corporate debtWe issued $600 million of 2.95% Senior Notes and $400 million of 3.80% Senior Notes and used the net proceeds, along with existing corporate cash, to redeem our outstanding $540 million of 5.375% Senior Notes and $460 million of 4.625% Senior Notes, resulting in a $58 million loss on early extinguishment of debt. This transaction reduces our annual corporate debt service costs from $50 million to $33 million.Repurchased 4.6 million shares of our common stockWe continue to execute on our stock repurchase plan, under which the Board of Directors has authorized a $1 billion repurchase of shares of our common stock. During the three months ended September 30, 2017, the Company repurchased 4.6 million shares of common stock at an average price of $40.64 for a total of $187 million. As of September 30, 2017, $813 million remained available for additional repurchases. As of October 31, 2017, we have subsequently repurchased an additional 1.0 million shares of common stock at an average price of $43.53.E*TRADE | Q3 2017 10-Q  3  Table of Contents Key Performance MetricsManagement monitors a number of customer activity and company metrics to evaluate the Company’s performance.

Customer margin balances were $8.5 billion and $6.8 billion at September 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Customer margin for periods prior to September 30, 2017, includes OptionsHouse balances which were held by a third party clearing firm.

Managed products are a driver of fees and service charges revenue. Managed products were $4.9 billion and $3.7 billion at September 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively.End of period brokerage accounts, net new brokerage accounts and brokerage account attrition rate are indicators of our ability to attract and retain brokerage customers. End of period brokerage accounts were 3.6 million and 3.4 million at September 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Net new brokerage accounts were 26,225 and 125,711 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017, respectively, and 161,885 and 225,434 for the same periods in 2016.

End of period brokerage accounts and net new brokerage accounts for the three months ended September 30, 2016 include 147,761 accounts from the OptionsHouse acquisition. Customer assets is an indicator of the value of our relationship with the customer. An increase generally indicates that the use of our products and services by existing and new customers is expanding. Changes in this metric are also driven by changes in the valuations of our customers' underlying securities. Customer assets were $365.3 billion and $306.8 billion at September 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively.Net new brokerage assets is total inflows to new and existing brokerage accounts less total outflows from closed and existing brokerage accounts.

Operating margin was 37% and 44% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017, respectively, compared to 46% and 44% for the same periods in 2016.Adjusted operating margin is a non-GAAP measure that provides useful information about our ongoing operating performance by excluding the provision (benefit) for loan losses and losses on early extinguishment of debt, which are not viewed as key factors governing our investment in the business and are excluded by management when evaluating operating margin performance. Adjusted operating margin was 42% and 39% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017, respectively, compared to 34% and 35% for the same periods in 2016. See Earnings Overview for a reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to the most directly comparable GAAP measure.Corporate cash, a non-GAAP measure, is a component of cash and equivalents and represents the primary source of capital above and beyond the capital deployed in our regulated subsidiaries. Corporate cash was $309 million and $306 million at September 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively, while cash and equivalents was $896 million and $1.5 billion for the same periods. See Liquidity and Capital Resources for a reconciliation of corporate cash to cash and equivalents.Tier 1 leverage ratio is an indicator of capital adequacy for E*TRADE Financial and E*TRADE Bank.

Allowance for loan losses was $94 million and $235 million at September 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively.Interest-earning assets, along with net interest margin, is an indicator of our ability to generate net interest income. Average interest-earning assets were $54.8 billion and $51.8 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017, respectively, compared to $44.5 billion and $42.9 billion for the same periods in 2016.Net interest margin is a measure of the net yield on our average interest-earning assets. Net interest margin is calculated for a given period by dividing the annualized sum of net interest income by average interest-earning assets. Net interest margin was 2.85% and 2.74% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017, respectively, compared to 2.59% and 2.67% for the same periods in 2016. Total employees were 3,584 and 3,655 at September 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively.E*TRADE | Q3 2017 10-Q  8  Table of Contents Regulatory DevelopmentsIn April 2016, the U.S. Department of Labor published its final fiduciary regulations under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Certain aspects of these regulations began to take effect in June 2017. These regulations generally subject particular persons, such as broker-dealers and other financial advisers providing investment advice to individual retirement accounts and other qualified retirement plans and accounts, to fiduciary duties and additional regulatory restrictions for a wider range of customer interactions. The remaining aspects of these regulations are currently scheduled to take effect on January 1, 2018. During this transition period, the Department of Labor indicated in Field Assistance Bulletin 2017-02 issued in May 2017, that it will not take enforcement actions against impacted parties that are in reasonable compliance with the regulations. The Company is in the process of implementing the remaining applicable components for compliance.The Company has historically not been subject to certain regulatory requirements that apply to banking organizations with $50 billion or more in total consolidated assets as defined by each applicable regulation. Total consolidated assets of $50 billion, which is measured in accordance with each applicable regulation, but generally on the basis of the average of the four most recent quarters, is a meaningful regulatory threshold as U.S. banking organizations become subject to a number of additional and, in some cases, more stringent regulatory requirements once they reach that size. The Company surpassed $50 billion in total consolidated assets on a four quarter average in the first quarter of 2017. The Company expects these regulatory requirements, not all of which have been finalized, to start becoming applicable to it in 2018. The Company has begun implementing policies, procedures, systems and governance structures that are designed to comply with the requirements. Additionally, while savings and loan holding companies are currently excluded from the scope of certain regulations that apply to bank holding companies, the Company expects it will ultimately be subject to these requirements.

Business of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016.E*TRADE | Q3 2017 10-Q  9  Table of Contents EARNINGS OVERVIEWWe generated net income of $147 million and $485 million on total net revenue of $599 million and $1.7 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017, respectively. The following chart provides a reconciliation of net income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 to net income for the three months ended September 30, 2017 (dollars in millions):(1)Total non-interest expense increased $82 million for the periods presented which includes $58 million of losses on early extinguishment of debt.E*TRADE | Q3 2017 10-Q  10  Table of Contents The significant components of the consolidated statement of income are as follows (dollars in millions except per share amounts): Three Months Ended September 30, Variance Nine Months Ended September 30, Variance  2017 vs. 2016  2017 vs. 2016 2017 2016 Amount % 2017 2016 Amount %Net interest income$391 $287 $104 36 % $1,066 $860 $206 24%Total non-interest income208 199 9 5 % 663 572 91 16%Total net revenue599 486 113 23 % 1,729 1,432 297 21%Provision (benefit) for loan losses(29) (62) 33 (53)% (142) (131) (11) 8%Total non-interest expense405 323 82 25 % 1,106 930 176 19%Income before income tax expense223 225 (2) (1)% 765 633 132 21%Income tax expense76 86 (10) (12)% 280 208 72 35%Net income$147 $139 $8 6 % $485 $425 $60 14%Preferred stock dividends12 — 12 100 % 25 — 25 100%Net income available to common shareholders$135 $139 $(4) (3)% $460 $425 $35 8%Diluted earnings per common share$0.49 $0.51 $(0.02) (4)% $1.67 $1.52 $0.15 10%Net income increased 6% to $147 million and 14% to $485 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2016. Net income available to common shareholders was $135 million and $460 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017, respectively, which reflects payments of $12 million and $25 million in preferred stock dividends, respectively, compared to net income available to common shareholders of $139 million and $425 million during the same periods in 2016. The increase in net income for both periods in 2017 was driven by higher interest income due to a larger balance sheet and higher interest rates, as well as higher fees and service charges revenue. We recognized a benefit for loan losses of $29 million and $142 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017, respectively, compared to $62 million and $131 million for the same periods in 2016. Net income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017 also included $11 million and $27 million, respectively, of pre-tax costs primarily incurred in connection with the OptionsHouse integration and preparation for the incremental regulatory and reporting requirements that our balance sheet growth requires, as well as pre-tax losses on early extinguishment of debt of $58 million. Non-interest expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017 also included higher advertising and market development expenses driven by our new advertising campaign, as well as increased communications expense. These expenses were partially offset by lower restructuring and acquisition-related activities and an income tax benefit related to the revaluation of certain net state deferred tax assets. Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 included an income tax benefit related to the release of a valuation allowance against certain state deferred tax assets.E*TRADE | Q3 2017 10-Q  11  Table of Contents Net RevenueThe components of net revenue and the resulting variances are as follows (dollars in millions): Three Months Ended September 30, Variance Nine Months Ended September 30, Variance  2017 vs. 2016  2017 vs. 2016 2017 2016 Amount % 2017 2016 Amount %Net interest income$391 $287 $104 36 % $1,066 $860 $206 24 %Commissions100 107 (7) (7)% 332 320 12 4 %Fees and service charges92 68 24 35 % 276 188 88 47 %Gains on securities and other, net6 14 (8) (57)% 23 34 (11) (32)%Other revenue10 10 — — % 32 30 2 7 %Total non-interest income208 199 9 5 % 663 572 91 16 %Total net revenue$599 $486 $113 23 % $1,729 $1,432 $297 21 %Net Interest IncomeNet interest income increased 36% to $391 million and 24% to $1.1 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2016.

The fluctuation in interest-earning assets is generally driven by changes in interest-bearing liabilities, primarily deposits and customer payables. Average interest-bearing liabilities increased 23% to $52.4 billion and 20% to $49.4 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2016. The increase was primarily due to higher deposits as a result of transferring customer cash held by third parties to our balance sheet. For additional information on our balance sheet growth and customer cash held by third parties, see Balance Sheet Overview.Net interest margin increased 26 basis points to 2.85% and 7 basis points to 2.74% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2016. Net interest margin is driven by the mix of asset and liability average balances and the interest rates earned or paid on those balances. The increase during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017, compared to the same period in 2016, is due to higher interest rates earned on increased margin receivable balances E*TRADE | Q3 2017 10-Q  14  Table of Contents and higher securities lending activities, partially offset by the continued run-off of our higher yielding legacy mortgage and consumer loan portfolio. CommissionsCommissions revenue decreased 7% to $100 million and increased 4% to $332 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2016. The main factors that affect commissions revenue are DARTs, average commission per trade and the number of trading days. DARTs volume increased 35% to 205,763 and 32% to 207,065 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2016, mainly driven by the inclusion of OptionsHouse accounts and the strength of the equity markets. Derivative DARTs represented 32% and 31% of trading volume for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017, respectively, compared to 26% and 25% of trading volume for the same periods in 2016. Average commission per trade decreased 29% to $7.76 and 21% to $8.54 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2016. Average commission per trade is impacted by customer mix and differing commission rates on various trade types (e.g. equities, derivatives, stock plan and mutual funds). Average commission per trade for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017 was impacted by reduced commission rates implemented in March 2017 as well as the lower price structure for customer accounts associated with the OptionsHouse acquisition. We have also experienced increased trading activity from certain customers, qualifying them for lower commission rates due to our new active trader pricing. This increased engagement is a key driver behind the decrease in average commission per trade.Fees and Service ChargesThe components of fees and service charges and the resulting variances are as follows (dollars in millions):  Three Months Ended September 30, Variance Nine Months Ended September 30, Variance  2017 vs. 2016  2017 vs. 2016 2017 2016 Amount % 2017 2016 Amount %Order flow revenue$33 $24 $9 38% $98 $68 $30 44%Money market funds and sweep deposits revenue(1)23 13 10 77% 71 31 40 129%Mutual fund service fees10 9 1 11% 29 27 2 7%Advisor management fees9 8 1 13% 26 21 5 24%Foreign exchange revenue6 6 — —% 20 15 5 33%Reorganization fees5 4 1 25% 13 11 2 18%Other fees and service charges6 4 2 50% 19 15 4 27%Total fees and service charges$92 $68 $24 35% $276 $188 $88 47%(1)Includes revenue earned on average customer cash held by third parties based on the federal funds rate or LIBOR plus a negotiated spread or other contractual arrangements with the third party institutions.Fees and service charges increased 35% to $92 million and 47% to $276 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2016. The increase in fees and service charges was largely driven by an increase in revenue earned on customer cash held by third parties, which was impacted by a higher interest rate environment, partially offset by lower average balances. The gross yield on customer cash held by third parties for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017 of approximately 120 and 85 basis points compares to approximately 45 and 40 basis E*TRADE | Q3 2017 10-Q  15  Table of Contents points for the same periods in 2016.

The timing and magnitude of the provision (benefit) for loan losses is affected by many factors that could result in variability. These benefits reflected better than expected performance of our portfolio as well as recoveries in excess of prior estimates, including recoveries of previous charge-offs. The benefit for loan losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 also reflected approximately $70 million of benefit recognized in the second quarter of 2017 resulting from refined default assumptions based on the sustained outperformance of converted mortgage loans that had been amortizing for 12 months or longer.

The increase was primarily driven by increased market data fees resulting from higher trading activity. Additionally, during the three months ended June 30, 2017, we updated our accrual estimate for professional users of real time market data and recognized $9 million related to previous usage. E*TRADE | Q3 2017 10-Q  17  Table of Contents Restructuring and Acquisition-Related ActivitiesRestructuring and acquisition-related activities were $4 million and $12 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017, respectively, compared to $25 million and $28 million the same periods in 2016. Restructuring and acquisition-related activities during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 reflected $18 million and $21 million, respectively, of restructuring costs related to the realignment of our core brokerage business and $7 million of acquisition related expense from the OptionsHouse acquisition. Losses on Early Extinguishment of DebtLosses on early extinguishment of debt were $58 million for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017. During the third quarter of 2017, we issued $600 million of 2.95% Senior Notes and $400 million of 3.80% Senior Notes and used the net proceeds, along with existing corporate cash, to redeem our outstanding $540 million of 5.375% Senior Notes and $460 million of 4.625% Senior Notes, which resulted in a $58 million loss on early extinguishment of debt.Operating MarginOperating margin was 37% and 44% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017, respectively, compared to 46% and 44% for the same periods in 2016. Adjusted operating margin, a non-GAAP measure, was 42% and 39% the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017, respectively, compared to 34% and 35% for the same periods in 2016.Adjusted operating margin is a non-GAAP measure calculated by dividing adjusted income before income tax expense by total net revenue.

Cash and equivalents will fluctuate based on a variety of factors, including, among other drivers, liquidity needs at the parent, customer activity at our regulated subsidiaries, and the timing of investments at E*TRADE Bank. For additional information on our use of cash and equivalents, including corporate cash, see Liquidity and Capital Resources.Segregated CashCash required to be segregated under federal or other regulations decreased 52% to $696 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2017. The level of segregated cash is driven largely by customer payables and securities lending balances we hold as liabilities compared with the amount of margin receivables and securities borrowed balances we hold as assets. The excess represents customer cash that we are required by our regulators to segregate for the exclusive benefit of our brokerage customers. At E*TRADE | Q3 2017 10-Q  20  Table of Contents September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, $800 million and $500 million, respectively, of reverse repurchase agreements between E*TRADE Securities and E*TRADE Bank, representing investments that were segregated under federal or other regulations by E*TRADE Securities, were eliminated in consolidation.

We classify debt securities as available-for-sale or held-to-maturity based on our investment strategy and management’s assessment of our intent and ability to hold the debt securities until maturity. The increase in total investments in securities during the nine months ended September 30, 2017 was primarily due to net purchases as a result of our efforts to grow the balance sheet by transferring customer cash held by third parties to our balance sheet. Margin ReceivablesMargin receivables increased 27% to $8.5 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2017. The increase in margin receivables was primarily driven by improved market sentiment increasing demand for additional margin lending. During the three months ended September 30, 2017, we also transferred $0.4 billion of customer margin balances held by a third party clearing firm to E*TRADE Securities in connection with the integration of OptionsHouse.E*TRADE | Q3 2017 10-Q  21  Table of Contents Loans Receivable, NetLoans receivable, net are summarized as follows (dollars in millions):   Variance September 30, December 31, 2017 vs. 2016 2017 2016 Amount %One- to four-family$1,531 $1,950 $(419) (21)%Home equity1,197 1,556 (359) (23)%Consumer and other192 250 (58) (23)%Total loans receivable2,920 3,756 (836) (22)%Unamortized premiums, net12 16 (4) (25)%Allowance for loan losses(94) (221) 127 (57)%Total loans receivable, net$2,838 $3,551 $(713) (20)%Loans receivable, net decreased 20% to $2.8 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2017.

See Liquidity and Capital Resources for additional information on liquidity and funding sources at E*TRADE Bank.LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESWe have established liquidity and capital policies to support the successful execution of our business strategy, while maintaining ongoing and sufficient liquidity through the business cycle. We believe liquidity is of critical importance to the Company and especially important for E*TRADE Bank and our broker-dealer subsidiaries. The objective of our policies is to ensure that we can meet our corporate, banking and broker-dealer liquidity needs under both normal operating conditions and under periods of stress in the financial markets. LiquidityOur corporate liquidity needs are primarily driven by capital needs at E*TRADE Bank and E*TRADE Securities as well as by the principal and interest due on our corporate debt and the amount of dividend payments on our preferred stock. Our banking and brokerage subsidiaries' liquidity needs are driven primarily by the level and volatility of our customer activity. Management maintains a set of liquidity sources and monitors certain business trends and market metrics closely in an effort to ensure we have sufficient liquidity. Potential loans by E*TRADE Bank to the parent company and its other non-bank subsidiaries are subject to various quantitative, arm’s length, collateralization, capital and other requirements. Parent Company LiquidityThe parent company's primary source of liquidity is corporate cash. Corporate cash, a non-GAAP measure, is a component of cash and equivalents; see the consolidated statement of cash flows within Item 1. Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) for information on cash and equivalents activity. We define corporate cash as cash held at the parent company and subsidiaries, excluding bank, broker-dealer, and futures commission merchant (FCM) subsidiaries that require regulatory approval or notification prior to the payment of certain dividends to the parent company.We believe corporate cash is a useful measure of the parent company’s liquidity as it is the primary source of capital above and beyond the capital deployed in our regulated subsidiaries. Corporate cash can fluctuate in any given quarter and is impacted primarily by the following:•Dividends from subsidiaries•Non-cumulative preferred stock dividends •Share repurchases•Debt service costs•Acquisitions and investments•Tax payments and the reimbursement from the parent company's subsidiaries for the use of its deferred tax assets•Other overhead and expense reimbursements through cost sharing arrangementsE*TRADE | Q3 2017 10-Q  24  Table of Contents The following chart provides a roll forward of corporate cash at December 31, 2016 to corporate cash at September 30, 2017 (dollars in millions):(1) Other activity includes contributions to subsidiaries and parent company overhead, offset by reimbursements from subsidiaries for use of the parent's deferred tax assets and related proceeds under overhead cost sharing arrangements.The following table provides a reconciliation of consolidated cash and equivalents to corporate cash, a non-GAAP measure (dollars in millions): September 30, December 31, September 30, 2017 2016 2016Consolidated cash and equivalents$896 $1,950 $1,467Less: Cash at regulated subsidiaries(1)(587) (1,489) (1,161)Corporate cash$309 $461 $306(1) Reported net of corporate cash on deposit at E*TRADE Bank that is eliminated in consolidation. Corporate cash decreased $152 million to $309 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2017. Corporate cash included dividends of $220 million from E*TRADE Securities to the parent company during the nine months ended September 30, 2017. Corporate cash also included the impact of share repurchases, corporate debt refinance activity, preferred stock dividends, debt service, overhead cost sharing arrangements between the parent and our operating subsidiaries, and the impact of annual incentive compensation payments in the nine months ended September 30, 2017.E*TRADE | Q3 2017 10-Q  25  Table of Contents During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017, we used $76 million of corporate cash along with the net proceeds from the issuance of $1 billion of senior notes, to redeem our higher cost corporate debt, and to pay the associated redemption premiums, accrued and unpaid interest and related fees and expenses. This transaction decreased our annual corporate debt service costs from $50 million to $33 million. We maintain corporate cash at a minimum of two times our scheduled annual corporate debt service payments and scheduled maturities over the next 12 months. As we do not have any scheduled maturities of corporate debt in the coming year, our current minimum under this methodology is approximately $66 million; however, we are currently targeting $200 million in corporate cash for future periods. Our nearest maturity of interest-bearing corporate debt is August 2022.On June 23, 2017, we entered into an unsecured committed revolving credit facility with certain lenders, which replaced our previous secured committed revolving credit facility entered into in November 2014 and increased our total borrowing capacity under the facility to $300 million. The Company has the ability to borrow against the credit facility for working capital and general corporate purposes. The unsecured committed revolving credit facility will mature on June 23, 2020. At September 30, 2017, there was no outstanding balance under this revolving credit facility.On October 19, 2017, we announced an agreement to acquire TCA for $275 million in cash. We anticipate funding the transaction through the issuance of non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock. Based on this structure, we do not expect the acquisition to impact our ability to maintain a 6.5% Tier 1 leverage ratio.E*TRADE Bank LiquidityE*TRADE Bank relies on bank cash and deposits for liquidity needs. Management believes that within deposits, sweep deposits are of particular importance as they are a stable source of liquidity for E*TRADE Bank. We have the ability to generate liquidity in the form of additional deposits by raising the yield on our customer deposit products and by bringing additional deposits onto our balance sheet. Sweep deposits on our balance sheet as of September 30, 2017 increased $10.1 billion compared to December 31, 2016. We utilize our sweep deposit platform to efficiently manage our balance sheet size.We may utilize wholesale funding sources for short-term liquidity and contingency funding requirements. Our ability to borrow these funds is dependent upon the continued availability of funding in the wholesale borrowings market. In addition, we can borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond's discount window to meet short-term liquidity requirements, although it is not viewed as a primary source of funding. At September 30, 2017, E*TRADE Bank had approximately $5.1 billion and $0.9 billion in additional collateralized borrowing capacity with the FHLB and the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, respectively. E*TRADE Securities LiquidityE*TRADE Securities relies on customer payables, securities lending, and internal and external lines of credit to provide liquidity and to fund margin lending. At September 30, 2017, E*TRADE Securities' external liquidity lines totaled approximately $1.1 billion and included the following:•A 364-day, $450 million senior unsecured committed revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks, with a maturity date of June 2018 and a commitment fee of 0.35% on unused balances•Secured committed lines of credit with two unaffiliated banks, aggregating to $175 million, with a maturity date of June 2018 and a commitment fee of 0.15% on unused balances•Unsecured uncommitted lines of credit with two unaffiliated banks, aggregating to $75 million, of which $50 million matures in June 2018 and the remaining line has no maturity date•Secured uncommitted lines of credit with several unaffiliated banks, aggregating to $375 million with no maturity dateThe revolving credit facility contains certain covenants, including maintenance covenants related to E*TRADE Securities' minimum consolidated tangible net worth and regulatory net capital ratio. There were E*TRADE | Q3 2017 10-Q  26  Table of Contents no outstanding balances for any of these lines at September 30, 2017. E*TRADE Securities also maintains lines of credit with the parent company and E*TRADE Bank.Liquidity Coverage RatioAs a result of the Company's balance sheet growth, we will be subject to the modified liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) requirement beginning April 1, 2018. The purpose of the LCR is to require banking organizations to hold minimum amounts of high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) based on a percentage of their net cash outflows over a 30-day period. Bank and savings and loan holding companies with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more, based on the average of the four most recent quarters, are subject to a modified LCR requiring them to hold HQLA in an amount equal to at least 70% of their projected net cash outflows over a 30-day period. The Company believes the LCR is an important measure of liquidity and has been managing against it in preparation for the applicability of these requirements. In addition, beginning October 1, 2018, we will be required to disclose certain quantitative and qualitative information related to our LCR calculation after each calendar quarter. Capital ResourcesBank Capital RequirementsThe Dodd-Frank Act requires all companies, including savings and loan holding companies, that directly or indirectly control an insured depository institution, to serve as a source of strength for the institution. The Company and E*TRADE Bank are subject to regulatory capital requirements. Some of these requirements are still subject to phase-in periods, including certain deductions from and adjustments to regulatory capital. These requirements are currently scheduled to be fully implemented in 2018, though proposed rulemaking may impact the phase-in periods or certain deductions. For additional information on bank regulatory requirements and phase-in periods, see Overview—Regulatory Developments as well as Part I. Item 1. Business—Regulation in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016. At September 30, 2017, our regulatory capital ratios for E*TRADE Financial were well above the minimum ratios required to be "well capitalized."

Broker-Dealer and FCM Capital RequirementsOur broker-dealer and FCM subsidiaries are subject to capital requirements determined by their respective regulators. At September 30, 2017, these subsidiaries met their minimum net capital requirements. We continue to assess our ability to distribute excess net capital to the parent while maintaining adequate capital at the broker-dealer and FCM subsidiaries. E*TRADE Securities paid dividends of $220 million to the parent company during the nine months ended September 30, 2017. For additional information on our broker-dealer and FCM capital requirements, see Note 13—Regulatory Requirements.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe enter into various off-balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business, primarily to meet the needs of our customers and to reduce our own exposure to interest rate risk. These arrangements include firm commitments to extend credit. Additionally, we enter into guarantees and other similar arrangements as part of transactions in the ordinary course of business. For additional information on these arrangements, see Note 14—Commitments, Contingencies and Other Regulatory Matters.E*TRADE | Q3 2017 10-Q  30  Table of Contents RISK MANAGEMENTThe identification, mitigation and management of existing and potential risks is critical to effective enterprise risk management. There are certain risks inherent to our industry (e.g. execution of transactions) and certain risks that will surface through the conduct of our business operations. We seek to monitor and manage our significant risk exposures by operating under a set of Board-approved limits and by monitoring certain risk indicators. Our governance framework is designed to comply with applicable requirements and requires regular reporting on metrics and significant risks and exposures to senior management and the Board of Directors.We face the following key types of risks: credit, interest rate, liquidity, market, operational, information security, strategic, reputational, legal, as well as regulatory and compliance. We have a Board-approved Enterprise Risk Appetite Statement (RAS) that is provided to all employees. The RAS specifies significant risk exposures and addresses the Company's tolerance of those risks, which are described in further detail within Part II. Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016. In August 2017, the RAS was updated and approved by the Board to include Data Management Risk—the risk of impairment to or loss of data assets through ineffective governance over the creation, usage, quality, inventory, storage, security and disposal of data assets.We are also subject to other risks that could impact our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows in future periods. See Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016.CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISKCredit risk is the risk of loss arising from the inability or failure of a borrower or counterparty to meet its credit obligations. Our loan portfolio represents our most significant credit risk exposure. See Part II. Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 for additional information on our management of credit risk. One- to Four-Family Interest-Only LoansOne- to four-family loans include loans with a five to ten year interest-only period, followed by an amortizing period ranging from 20 to 25 years. At September 30, 2017, over 99% of the loans were amortizing and the portfolio will be fully converted in 2018. Home Equity LoansThe home equity loan portfolio consists of home equity installment loans (HEILs) and home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) and is primarily second lien loans on residential real estate properties that have a higher level of credit risk than first lien mortgage loans. HEILs are primarily fixed rate and fixed term, fully amortizing loans that do not offer the option of an interest-only payment. The majority of HELOCs had an interest only draw period at origination and converted to amortizing loans at the end of the draw period, which typically ranged from five to ten years. At September 30, 2017, 1% of the HELOC portfolio had not converted from the interest-only draw period and will be fully converted in 2019.E*TRADE | Q3 2017 10-Q  31  Table of Contents Nonperforming AssetsWe classify loans as nonperforming when they are no longer accruing interest, which includes loans that are 90 days and greater past due, TDRs that are on nonaccrual status for all classes of loans (including loans in bankruptcy) and certain junior liens that have a delinquent senior lien. The following table shows comparative data for nonperforming loans and assets at September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 (dollars in millions): September 30, 2017 December 31, 2016One- to four-family$196 $215Home equity109 136Consumer and other— 1Total nonperforming loans receivable305 352Real estate owned and other repossessed assets, net28 36Total nonperforming assets, net$333$388Allowance for Loan LossesThe allowance for loan losses is management’s estimate of probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date, as well as the forecasted losses, including economic concessions to borrowers, over the estimated remaining life of loans modified as TDRs. The general allowance for loan losses includes a qualitative component to account for a variety of factors that present additional uncertainty that may not be fully considered in the quantitative loss model but are factors we believe may impact the level of credit losses.

The benefit for loan losses of $142 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 reflected approximately $70 million of benefit recognized in the second quarter of 2017 resulting from refined default assumptions based on the sustained outperformance of converted mortgage loans that had been amortizing for 12 months or longer.E*TRADE | Q3 2017 10-Q  32  Table of Contents Net recoveries for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 were $15 million compared to $13 million in the same period in 2016. The timing and magnitude of charge-offs and recoveries are affected by many factors and we anticipate variability from quarter to quarter. For additional information on the loans portfolio and management's estimate of the allowance for loan losses, see Note 6—Loans Receivable, Net and Summary of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates.SecuritiesWe focus primarily on security type and credit rating to monitor credit risk in our securities portfolios. We consider securities backed by the U.S. government or its agencies to have low credit risk as the long-term debt rating of the U.S. government is AA+ by S&P and AAA by Moody’s and Fitch at September 30, 2017. The amortized cost of these securities accounted for over 99% of our total securities portfolio at September 30, 2017. We review the remaining debt securities that were not backed by the U.S. government or its agencies according to their credit ratings from S&P, Moody’s and Fitch where available. At September 30, 2017, all municipal bonds in our securities portfolio were rated investment grade (defined as a rating equivalent to a Moody’s rating of "Baa3" or higher, or an S&P or Fitch rating of "BBB-" or higher).E*TRADE | Q3 2017 10-Q  33  Table of Contents SUMMARY OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATESThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in conformity with GAAP. Note 1—Organization, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, contains a summary of our significant accounting policies, many of which require the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and related notes for the periods presented. We believe that of our significant accounting policies, the following are critical because they are based on estimates and assumptions that require complex and subjective judgments by management: allowance for loan losses; valuation and impairment of goodwill and acquired intangible assets; and estimates of effective tax rates, deferred taxes and valuation allowance. Changes in these estimates or assumptions could materially impact our financial condition and results of operations, and actual results could differ from our estimates. With respect to the allowance for loan losses, we refined our default assumptions during the second quarter of 2017 based on the sustained outperformance of loans that reached the end of their interest-only period. Our remaining critical accounting policies are more fully described in Part II. Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Summary of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016.Allowance for Loan LossesDescriptionThe allowance for loan losses is management’s estimate of probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date. In determining the adequacy of the allowance, we perform ongoing evaluations of the loan portfolio and loss forecasting assumptions. As of September 30, 2017, the allowance for loan losses was $94 million on $2.9 billion of total gross loans receivable designated as held-for-investment.JudgmentsDetermining the adequacy of the allowance is complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Subsequent evaluations of the loan portfolio, in light of the factors then prevailing, may result in significant changes in the allowance for loan losses in future periods. For loans that are not TDRs, we establish a general allowance and evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses by loan portfolio segment: one- to four-family, home equity and consumer. For modified loans accounted for as TDRs that are valued using the discounted cash flow model, we establish a specific allowance by forecasting losses, including economic concessions to borrowers, over the estimated remaining life of these loans. E*TRADE | Q3 2017 10-Q  34  Table of Contents The estimate of the allowance for loan losses continues to be based on a variety of quantitative and qualitative factors, including:•The composition and quality of the portfolio•Delinquency levels and trends•Current and historical charge-off and loss experience•Our historical loss mitigation experience•The condition of the real estate market and geographic concentrations within the loan portfolio•The interest rate climate•The overall availability of housing credit•General economic conditions, including the impact of weather-related eventsTotal loans receivable designated as held-for-investment decreased $0.7 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2017. The allowance for loan losses was $94 million, or 3.2% of total loans receivable, as of September 30, 2017 compared to $221 million, or 5.8% of total loans receivable, as of December 31, 2016. The benefit for loan losses was $29 million and $142 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017, respectively. The allowance for loan losses is typically equal to management’s forecast of loan losses in the 18 months following the balance sheet date as well as the forecasted losses, including economic concessions to borrowers, over the estimated remaining life of loans modified as TDRs. The quantitative allowance methodology also includes the identification of higher risk mortgage loans and the period of loan losses captured within the general allowance includes the total probable loss over the remaining life of these loans. As mortgage loan conversions from interest-only to amortizing have continued, 99% of HELOCs and over 99% of one- to four-family mortgages had converted at September 30, 2017. During the second quarter of 2017, management refined the default assumptions in the quantitative allowance methodology based on the sustained outperformance of converted mortgage loans that had been amortizing for 12 months or longer. At the time of this refinement, more than 50% of these converted loans had been amortizing 12 months or longer. This actual performance data was better than our prior performance assumptions, and combined with the substantial performance history, the uncertainty with respect to the population of converting loans had significantly decreased as of June 30, 2017. This refinement resulted in approximately $70 million of benefit for loan losses during the second quarter of 2017. In order to refine our default assumptions around the remaining population that had not yet started amortizing or that had not reached 12 months post conversion, we evaluated whether the credit quality and performance of these loans was consistent with the seasoned amortizing portfolio. We determined that FICO scores, LTV/CLTVs and delinquency rates were comparable to the seasoned portfolio, and therefore applied the refined default assumptions to this remaining population.The general allowance for loan losses also included a qualitative component to account for a variety of factors that present additional uncertainty that may not be fully considered in the quantitative loss model but are factors we believe may impact the level of credit losses. We utilize a qualitative factor framework whereby, on a quarterly basis, management assesses the risk associated with three primary sets of factors: external factors, internal factors, and portfolio specific factors. The uncertainty related to these factors may expand over time, temporarily increasing the qualitative component in advance of the more precise identification of these probable losses being captured within the quantitative component of the general allowance. The total qualitative component was $10 million and $6 million as of September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively.E*TRADE | Q3 2017 10-Q  35  Table of Contents Effects if Actual Results DifferIt is difficult to estimate how potential changes in the quantitative and qualitative factors, including the impact of loans converting from interest only to amortizing, might impact the allowance for loan losses. Our underlying assumptions and judgments could prove to be inaccurate, which could materially impact our regulatory capital position and results of operations in future periods.During the normal course of conducting examinations, our banking regulators, the OCC and Federal Reserve, continue to review our business and practices. This process is dynamic and ongoing and we cannot be certain that additional changes or actions will not result from their continuing review.ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKThe following discussion about market risk includes forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including, but not limited to, those set forth in Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016. Interest Rate RiskOur exposure to interest rate risk is related primarily to interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Managing interest rate risk is essential to profitability. The primary objective of the management of interest rate risk is to control exposure to interest rates within the Board-approved limits and with limited exposure to earnings volatility resulting from interest rate fluctuations. Our general strategies to manage interest rate risk include balancing variable-rate and fixed-rate assets and liabilities and utilizing derivatives to help manage exposures to changes in interest rates. Exposure to interest rate risk requires management to make complex assumptions regarding maturities, market interest rates and customer behavior. Changes in interest rates, including the following, could impact interest income and expense:•Interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities may re-price at different times or by different amounts, creating a mismatch.•The yield curve may steepen, flatten or otherwise change shape, which could affect the spread between short- and long-term rates. Widening or narrowing spreads could impact net interest income.•Market interest rates may influence prepayments, resulting in maturity mismatches. In addition, prepayments could impact yields as premiums and discounts amortize.Exposure to interest rate risk is dependent upon the distribution and composition of interest-earning assets, interest-bearing liabilities and derivatives. The differing risk characteristics of each product are managed to mitigate our exposure to interest rate fluctuations. At September 30, 2017, 93% of our total assets were interest-earning assets and we had no securities classified as trading.At September 30, 2017, approximately 67% of total assets were available-for-sale and held-to-maturity mortgage-backed securities and residential real estate loans. The values of these assets are sensitive to changes in interest rates as well as expected prepayment levels. As interest rates increase, fixed-rate residential mortgages and mortgage-backed securities tend to exhibit lower prepayments. The inverse is true in a falling rate environment.When real estate loans are prepaid, unamortized premiums and/or discounts are recognized immediately in interest income. Depending on the timing of the prepayment, these adjustments to income would impact anticipated yields. The Company reviews estimates of the impact of changing market rates on prepayments. This information is incorporated into our interest rate risk management strategy.E*TRADE | Q3 2017 10-Q  36  Table of Contents Our liability structure consists of two central sources of funding: deposits and customer payables, both of which re-price at management’s discretion. We may utilize wholesale funding sources as needed for short-term liquidity and contingency funding requirements. Derivative InstrumentsWe use derivative instruments to help manage interest rate risk using designated hedge relationships. Interest rate swaps involve the exchange of fixed-rate and variable-rate interest payments between two parties based on a contractual underlying notional amount, but do not involve the exchange of the underlying notional amounts. See Note 7—Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities for additional information about our use of derivative contracts.Scenario AnalysisScenario analysis is an advanced approach to estimating interest rate risk exposure. The Company monitors interest rate risk using the Economic Value of Equity (EVE) approach and the Earnings-at-Risk (EAR) approach. Under the EVE approach, the present value of expected cash flows of all existing interest-earning assets, interest-bearing liabilities, derivatives and forward commitments are estimated and combined to produce an EVE figure. The change in EVE is a long-term sensitivity measure of interest rate risk. The approach values only the current balance sheet in which the most significant assumptions are the prepayment rates of the loan portfolio and mortgage-backed securities and the repricing of deposits. This approach does not incorporate assumptions related to business growth, or liquidation and re-investment of instruments. This approach provides an indicator of future earnings and capital levels because changes in EVE indicate the anticipated change in the value of future cash flows. The sensitivity of this value to changes in interest rates is then determined by applying alternative interest rate scenarios. The change in EVE amounts fluctuate based on instantaneous parallel shifts in interest rates primarily due to the change in timing of cash flows, which considers prepayment estimates, in the Company’s residential loan and mortgage-backed securities portfolios.EAR is a short-term sensitivity measure of interest rate risk and illustrates the impact of alternative interest rate scenarios on net interest income, including corporate interest expense, over a twelve month time frame. In measuring the sensitivity of net interest income to changes in interest rates, we assume instantaneous parallel interest rate shocks applied to the forward curve. In addition, we assume that cash flows from loan payoffs are reinvested in mortgage-backed securities, we exclude revenue from off-balance sheet customer cash and we assume no balance sheet growth.The sensitivity of EAR and EVE at the consolidated E*TRADE Financial level at September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 is as follows (dollars in millions):Instantaneous Parallel Change in Interest Rates (basis points) (1) Economic Value of Equity Earnings-at-Risk September 30, 2017 December 31, 2016 September 30, 2017 December 31, 2016 Amount Percentage Amount Percentage Amount Percentage Amount Percentage+200 $(205) (2.6)% $(129) (2.1)% $207 13.4 % $169 13.9 %+100 $95 1.2 % $59 0.9 % $142 9.2 % $109 9.0 %-50 $(203) (2.6)% $(106) (1.7)% $(96) (6.2)% $(73) (6.0)%(1)These scenario analyses assume a balance sheet size as of the dates indicated. Any changes in size would cause the amounts to vary.We actively manage interest rate risk positions. As interest rates change, we will adjust our strategy and mix of assets, liabilities and derivatives to optimize our position. For example, a 100 basis points increase in rates may not result in a change in value as indicated above. We compare the instantaneous parallel shift in interest rate changes in EVE and EAR to the established limits set by the Board of Directors in order to E*TRADE | Q3 2017 10-Q  37  Table of Contents assess interest rate risk. In the event that the percentage change in EVE or EAR exceeds the Board limits, our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Risk Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer must all be promptly notified in writing and decide upon a plan of remediation. In addition, the Board of Directors must be notified of the exception and the planned resolution.

CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Unaudited)NOTE 1—ORGANIZATION, BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIESOrganizationE*TRADE Financial Corporation is a financial services company that provides brokerage and related products and services primarily to individual retail investors under the brand E*TRADE Financial. The Company also provides investor-focused banking products, primarily sweep deposits, to retail investors. Basis of PresentationThe condensed consolidated financial statements, also referred to herein as the consolidated financial statements, include the accounts of the Company and its majority-owned subsidiaries as determined under the voting interest model. Entities in which the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence but in which the Company does not possess control are generally accounted for by the equity method. Entities in which the Company does not have the ability to exercise significant influence are generally carried at cost. Investments in marketable equity securities where the Company does not have the ability to exercise significant influence over the entities are accounted for as available-for-sale equity securities. The Company also evaluates its initial and continuing involvement with certain entities to determine if the Company is required to consolidate the entities under the variable interest entity (VIE) model. This evaluation is based on a qualitative assessment of whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of the VIE, which requires the Company to possess both: 1) the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the VIE; and 2) the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. The consolidated financial statements do not include any consolidated VIEs for all periods presented.The Company's consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. Intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. These financial statements reflect all adjustments, which are normal and recurring in nature, necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. These consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016. While certain disclosures included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been omitted in this quarterly report, the Company believes that the information and disclosures presented herein are adequate and that such disclosures are not misleading.Use of EstimatesPreparing the Company's consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and related notes for the periods presented. Actual results could differ from management’s estimates. Certain significant accounting policies are critical because they are based on estimates and assumptions that require complex and subjective judgments by management. Changes in these estimates or assumptions could materially impact the Company’s financial condition and results of operations. Material estimates in which management believes changes could reasonably occur include: allowance for loan losses; valuation and impairment of goodwill and acquired intangible assets; and estimates of effective tax rates, deferred taxes and valuation allowance.E*TRADE | Q3 2017 10-Q  50  Table of Contents Adoption of New Accounting StandardsAccounting for Employee Share-Based PaymentsIn March 2016, the FASB amended the accounting guidance on employee share-based payments. Relevant changes in the amended guidance include the requirement to recognize all excess tax benefits and deficiencies upon exercise or vesting as income tax expense or benefit in the consolidated statement of income; to treat excess tax benefits and deficiencies as discrete items in the reporting period they occur; to not delay recognition of excess tax benefits until the tax benefit is realized through a reduction in current taxes payable; and to make an accounting policy election to either estimate forfeitures or account for them as they occur. The Company adopted the amended accounting guidance as of January 1, 2017 and recognized a $3 million deferred tax asset and cumulative-effect adjustment to equity as of the beginning of the period. In addition, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 the Company reclassified $17 million related to shares withheld to pay taxes from cash flows from operating activities to the other line item within cash flows from financing activities. Forfeitures will continue to be estimated consistent with the Company's prior accounting policies. The impact to the Company's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows will vary based on, among other factors, the market price of the Company's common stock. During the nine months ended September 30, 2017 the Company recognized an $8 million income tax benefit in accordance with the new guidance.New Accounting Standards Not Yet AdoptedRevenue Recognition on Contracts with CustomersIn May 2014, the FASB amended the guidance on revenue recognition on contracts with customers. The new standard outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to apply in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers. The Company's accounting for net interest income is not expected to be impacted by the new standard. The FASB issued supplemental amendments to the new standard to clarify certain accounting guidance and provide narrow scope improvements and practical expedients during 2016. The amended guidance will be effective for annual and interim periods beginning on January 1, 2018 and may be applied on either a full retrospective or modified retrospective basis. Based on the Company's analysis to date, this adoption is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows as the satisfaction of performance obligations under the new guidance is expected to be materially consistent with the Company's existing revenue recognition policies. Similarly, the amended guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the recognition of costs incurred to obtain new contracts. The Company is in process of completing its evaluation of the new guidance, including considerations relating to financial statement presentation, disclosures and controls. The Company intends to apply the guidance on a modified retrospective basis. Classification and Measurement of Financial InstrumentsIn January 2016, the FASB amended the accounting and disclosure guidance on the classification and measurement of financial instruments. Relevant changes in the amended guidance include the requirement that equity investments, excluding those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those resulting in consolidation of the investee, be measured at fair value in the consolidated balance sheet with changes in fair value recognized in net income. For disclosure purposes, the Company will no longer be required to disclose the methods and significant assumptions used to estimate fair value for financial instruments measured at amortized cost in the consolidated balance sheet. The amended guidance will be effective for interim and annual periods beginning on January 1, 2018, and is required to be applied on a modified retrospective basis by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the consolidated balance sheet on that date. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows as debt securities represent the majority of the Company's investment portfolio.E*TRADE | Q3 2017 10-Q  51  Table of Contents Accounting for LeasesIn February 2016, the FASB amended the guidance on accounting for leases. The new standard requires lessees to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for the rights and obligations created by all qualifying leases with terms of more than twelve months. The recognition, measurement and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease by a lessee remains substantially unchanged and depends on classification as a finance or operating lease. The new standard also requires quantitative and qualitative disclosures that provide information about the amounts related to leasing arrangements recorded in the consolidated financial statements. The new guidance will be effective for interim and annual periods beginning on January 1, 2019, and is required to be applied on a modified retrospective basis to the earliest period presented, which includes practical expedient options in certain circumstances. The Company is in the process of evaluating the new accounting guidance, which includes the assessment of whether certain executory contracts contain embedded leases. The Company has 30 regional branches and 10 corporate locations which are leased. The right of use asset and corresponding lease liability for these leases will be recognized on the Company's balance sheet upon adoption. Accounting for Credit LossesIn June 2016, the FASB amended the accounting guidance on accounting for credit losses. The amended guidance requires measurement of all expected credit losses for financial instruments and other commitments to extend credit held at the reporting date. For financial assets measured at amortized cost, factors such as historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts will be used to estimate expected credit losses. The amended guidance will also change the manner in which credit losses are recognized on debt securities classified as available-for-sale. The new guidance will be effective for interim and annual periods beginning January 1, 2020. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the new accounting guidance on the Company's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The Company does not expect the amended accounting guidance to have as significant of an impact as it could have if the Company were originating or purchasing loans. Our evaluation is contemplating the recent performance of the Company's run-off legacy mortgage and consumer loan portfolio and the credit profile of the current investment securities portfolio; however, the impact of the new guidance will depend on the current and expected macroeconomic conditions and the nature and characteristics of financial assets held by us on the date of adoption.Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash PaymentsIn August 2016, the FASB amended the guidance on the presentation and classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments in the consolidated statement of cash flows to eliminate current diversity in practice. The new guidance will be effective for interim and annual periods beginning January 1, 2018, and must be applied using a retrospective transition method to each period presented. Among other changes, the Company expects to begin classifying debt extinguishment costs within cash flows from financing activities. Classification of Restricted CashIn November 2016, the FASB amended the guidance on the presentation and classification of changes in restricted cash in the consolidated statement of cash flows to eliminate current diversity in practice. The amended guidance requires the consolidated statement of cash flows to explain the change during the period in the total cash, cash equivalents, and amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents. The Company expects to begin presenting segregated cash activity on the consolidated statement of cash flows. The guidance will be effective for interim and annual periods beginning January 1, 2018, and must be applied using a retrospective transition method to each period presented. E*TRADE | Q3 2017 10-Q  52  Table of Contents Clarifying the Definition of a BusinessIn January 2017, the FASB issued guidance to clarify the definition of a business in order to assist companies in the evaluation of whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions or disposals of assets or businesses. The amended guidance also removes the existing evaluation of a market participant's ability to replace missing elements and narrows the definition of output to achieve consistency with other topics. The guidance will be effective for interim and annual periods beginning January 1, 2018, and must be applied prospectively.Simplifying the Test for Goodwill ImpairmentIn January 2017, the FASB issued guidance to simplify the test for goodwill impairment by eliminating Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. The amended guidance requires the Company to perform its annual goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. An impairment charge should be recognized at the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit; however, the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Income tax effects resulting from any tax deductible goodwill should be considered when measuring the goodwill impairment loss, if applicable. The Company will still have the option to perform a qualitative assessment to conclude whether it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of the Company exceeds its fair value. The guidance will be effective for interim and annual periods beginning January 1, 2020, and must be applied prospectively. Early adoption is permitted. Premium Amortization on Purchased Callable Debt SecuritiesIn March 2017, the FASB issued guidance to amend the amortization period for certain purchased callable debt securities held at a premium. The amended guidance shortens the amortization period for certain callable debt securities held at a premium by requiring the premium to be amortized to the earliest call date. The guidance does not amend the accounting for securities held at a discount. The guidance will be effective for interim and annual periods beginning January 1, 2019, and must be applied on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. Early adoption is permitted. Based on the current composition of the Company's securities portfolio, the new guidance is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company's financial condition or results of operations. Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging ActivitiesIn August 2017, the FASB issued guidance to update the recognition and presentation of hedging relationships. Among other changes, the new guidance eases hedge documentation requirements and allows additional types of accounting hedges. In addition, the guidance provides a one-time transition election to transfer certain debt securities from held-to-maturity to available-for-sale. The guidance will be effective for interim and annual periods beginning January 1, 2019, and must be applied on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is in process of evaluating the new guidance, including adoption timing, which could be as early as January 1, 2018.E*TRADE | Q3 2017 10-Q  53  Table of Contents NOTE 2—INTEREST INCOME AND INTEREST EXPENSEThe following table shows the components of interest income and interest expense (dollars in millions): Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2017 2016 2017 2016Interest income:       Cash and equivalents$2 $2 $6 $5Cash required to be segregated under federal or other regulations3 2 9 4Available-for-sale securities102 66 282 198Held-to-maturity securities153 109 410 319Margin receivables87 60 228 185Loans37 46 121 146Broker-related receivables and other1 — 2 1Subtotal interest income385 285 1,058 858Other interest revenue(1)28 24 74 65Total interest income413 309 1,132 923Interest expense:       Deposits(1) (1) (3) (3)Customer payables(1) (2) (4) (4)Other borrowings(6) (4) (16) (13)Corporate debt(12) (13) (39) (40)Subtotal interest expense(20)(20) (62) (60)Other interest expense(2)(2) (2) (4) (3)Total interest expense(22) (22) (66) (63)Net interest income$391 $287 $1,066 $860(1)Represents interest income on securities loaned.(2)Represents interest expense on securities borrowed.NOTE 3—FAIR VALUE DISCLOSURESFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In determining fair value, the Company may use various valuation approaches, including market, income and/or cost approaches. The fair value hierarchy requires the Company to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Fair value is a market-based measure considered from the perspective of a market participant. Accordingly, even when market assumptions are not readily available, the Company’s own assumptions reflect those that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. The fair value measurement accounting guidance describes the following three levels used to classify fair value measurements:•Level 1—unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that are accessible by the Company•Level 2—quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in an active market, quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly•Level 3—unobservable inputs that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilitiesE*TRADE | Q3 2017 10-Q  54  Table of Contents The availability of observable inputs can vary and in certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, the level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The Company’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to a fair value measurement requires judgment and consideration of factors specific to the asset or liability.Recurring Fair Value Measurement TechniquesMortgage-backed SecuritiesThe Company’s mortgage-backed securities portfolio is comprised of agency mortgage-backed securities which are guaranteed by U.S. government sponsored enterprises and federal agencies. The fair value of agency mortgage-backed securities was determined using a market approach with quoted market prices, recent transactions and spread data for identical or similar instruments. Agency mortgage-backed securities were categorized in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.Other Debt SecuritiesThe Company's fair value level classification of U.S. Treasuries is based on the original maturity dates of the securities and whether the securities are the most recent issuances of a given maturity. U.S. Treasuries with original maturities less than one year are classified as Level 1. U.S. Treasuries with original maturities longer than one year are classified as Level 1 if they represent the most recent issuance of a given maturity; otherwise, these securities are classified as Level 2. The fair value measurements of agency debentures and agency debt securities were determined using market and income approaches along with the Company’s own trading activities for identical or similar instruments and were categorized in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.All of the Company’s municipal bonds were rated investment grade at September 30, 2017. These securities were valued using a market approach with pricing service valuations corroborated by recent market transactions for identical or similar bonds. Municipal bonds and corporate bonds were categorized in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.Publicly Traded Equity SecuritiesThe fair value measurements of the Company's publicly traded equity securities were classified as Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy as they were based on quoted prices in active markets.Derivative InstrumentsInterest rate swap and option contracts were valued with an income approach using pricing models that are commonly used by the financial services industry. The market observable inputs used in the pricing models include the swap curve, the volatility surface, and prime or overnight indexed swap basis from a financial data provider. The Company does not consider these models to involve significant judgment on the part of management, and the Company corroborated the fair value measurements with counterparty valuations. The Company’s derivative instruments were categorized in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The consideration of credit risk, the Company’s or the counterparty’s, did not result in an adjustment to the valuation of its derivative instruments in the periods presented.E*TRADE | Q3 2017 10-Q  55  Table of Contents Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurement TechniquesCertain other assets are recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis: 1) one- to four-family and home equity loans in which the amount of the loan balance in excess of the estimated current value of the underlying property less estimated selling costs has been charged-off; and 2) real estate owned that is carried at the lower of the property’s carrying value or fair value less estimated selling costs.The Company evaluates and reviews assets that have been subject to fair value measurement requirements on a quarterly basis in accordance with policies and procedures that were designed to be in compliance with guidance from the Company’s regulators. These policies and procedures govern the frequency of the review, the use of acceptable valuation methods, and the consideration of estimated selling costs.Loans ReceivableLoans that have been delinquent for 180 days or that are in bankruptcy and certain TDR loan modifications are charged-off based on the estimated current value of the underlying property less estimated selling costs. Property valuations for these one- to four-family and home equity loans are based on the most recent "as is" property valuation data available, which may include appraisals, broker price opinions (BPOs), automated valuation models or updated values using home price indices. Subsequent to the recording of an initial fair value measurement, these loans continue to be measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, utilizing the estimated value of the underlying property less estimated selling costs. These property valuations are updated on a monthly, quarterly or semi-annual basis depending on the type of valuation initially used. If the valuation data obtained is significantly different from the valuation previously received, the Company reviews additional property valuation data to corroborate or update the valuation. If the value of the underlying property has declined, an additional charge-off is recorded. If the value of the underlying property has increased, previously charged-off amounts are not reversed. Recoveries of previously charged-off amounts are recognized within the allowance for loan losses when received. Real Estate OwnedProperty valuations for real estate owned are based on the lowest value of the most recent property valuation data available, which may include appraisals, listing prices or approved offer prices. Nonrecurring fair value measurements on one- to four-family and home equity loans and real estate owned were classified as Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy as the valuations included unobservable inputs that were significant to the fair value. The following table presents additional information about significant unobservable inputs used in the valuation of assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis that were categorized in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy at September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016: Unobservable Inputs Average RangeSeptember 30, 2017     Loans receivable:     One- to four-familyAppraised value $470,600 $40,500-$1,200,000Home equityAppraised value $327,800 $30,000-$2,200,000Real estate ownedAppraised value $363,700 $13,500-$2,200,000      December 31, 2016     Loans receivable:     One- to four-familyAppraised value $408,100 $50,000-$1,490,000Home equityAppraised value $312,000 $6,000-$2,500,000Real estate ownedAppraised value $342,300 $21,500-$1,800,000E*TRADE | Q3 2017 10-Q  56  Table of Contents Recurring and Nonrecurring Fair Value MeasurementsAssets and liabilities measured at fair value at September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 are summarized in the following tables (dollars in millions): Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 TotalFair ValueSeptember 30, 2017:       Recurring fair value measurements:       Assets       Available-for-sale securities:       Debt securities:       Agency mortgage-backed securities$— $17,663 $— $17,663Agency debentures— 989 — 989U.S. Treasuries— 450 — 450Agency debt securities— 33 — 33Municipal bonds— 31 — 31Total debt securities— 19,166 — 19,166Publicly traded equity securities7 — — 7Total available-for-sale securities7 19,166 — 19,173Receivables from brokers, dealers and clearing organizations:       U.S. Treasuries200 — — 200Other assets:       Derivative assets(1)— 92 — 92Total assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis(2)$207 $19,258 $— $19,465Liabilities       Other liabilities:       Derivative liabilities(1)$— $37 $— $37Total liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis(2)$— $37 $— $37Nonrecurring fair value measurements:       Loans receivable, net:       One- to four-family$— $— $19 $19Home equity— — 18 18Total loans receivable— — 37 37Other assets:       Real estate owned— — 23 23Total assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis(3)$— $— $60 $60 (1)All derivative assets and liabilities were interest rate contracts at September 30, 2017.

The fair value of held-to-maturity securities is determined consistently with the pricing of available-for-sale securities described above.Loans receivable, net—Fair value is estimated using a discounted cash flow model. Loans are differentiated based on their individual portfolio characteristics, such as product classification, loan category and pricing features. Assumptions for expected losses, prepayments, cash flows and discount rates are adjusted to reflect the individual characteristics of the loans, such as credit risk, coupon, lien position, and payment characteristics, as well as the secondary market conditions for these types of loans.E*TRADE | Q3 2017 10-Q  61  Table of Contents Although the market for one- to four-family and home equity loan portfolios has improved, given the lack of observability of valuation inputs, these fair value measurements cannot be determined with precision and changes in the underlying assumptions used, including discount rates, could significantly affect the results of current or future fair value estimates. In addition, the amount that would be realized in a forced liquidation, an actual sale or immediate settlement could be lower than both the carrying value and the estimated fair value of the portfolio.Deposits—For certificates of deposit, fair value is estimated using a discounted cash flow model. For the remainder of deposits, fair value is the amount payable on demand at the reporting date.FHLB advances—Fair value for FHLB advances was determined by discounting future cash flows using discount factors derived from current observable rates implied for other similar instruments with similar remaining maturities.Trust preferred securities—For subordinated debentures, fair value is estimated by discounting future cash flows at the yield implied by dealer pricing quotes. Corporate debt—For interest-bearing corporate debt, fair value is estimated using dealer pricing quotes. Fair Value of Commitments and ContingenciesIn the normal course of business, the Company makes various commitments to extend credit and incur contingent liabilities that are not reflected in the consolidated balance sheet. Changes in the economy or interest rates may influence the impact that these commitments and contingencies have on the Company in the future. The Company does not estimate the fair value of those commitments. The Company has the right to cancel these commitments in certain circumstances and has closed a significant amount of customer HELOCs in the past ten years. Information related to such commitments and contingent liabilities is included in Note 14—Commitments, Contingencies and Other Regulatory Matters.E*TRADE | Q3 2017 10-Q  62  Table of Contents NOTE 4—OFFSETTING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES For financial statement purposes, the Company does not offset derivative instruments or securities borrowing and securities lending transactions. These activities are generally transacted under master agreements that are widely used by counterparties and that may allow for net settlements of payments in the normal course, as well as offsetting of all contracts with a given counterparty in the event of bankruptcy or default of one of the two parties to the transaction. The following table presents information about these transactions to enable the users of the Company’s consolidated financial statements to evaluate the potential effect of rights of set-off between these recognized assets and liabilities at September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 (dollars in millions):          Gross Amounts Not Offset in the Consolidated Balance Sheet      Gross Amounts of Recognized Assets and Liabilities Gross Amounts Offset in the Consolidated Balance Sheet Net Amounts Presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet (1) Financial Instruments Collateral Received or Pledged (Including Cash) Net AmountSeptember 30, 2017            Assets:             Deposits paid for securities borrowed (2)$484 $— $484 $(200) $(273) $11   Total$484 $— $484 $(200) $(273) $11                Liabilities:             Deposits received for securities loaned (3)$1,348 $— $1,348 $(200) $(1,049) $99  Derivative liabilities (4)(5)7 — 7 — (7) —   Total$1,355 $— $1,355 $(200) $(1,056) $99               December 31, 2016            Assets:             Deposits paid for securities borrowed (2)$774 $— $774 $(192) $(560) $22   Total$774 $— $774 $(192) $(560) $22                Liabilities:             Deposits received for securities loaned (3)$926 $— $926 $(192) $(661) $73  Derivative liabilities (4)(5)6 — 6 — (6) —   Total$932 $— $932 $(192) $(667) $73(1)Net amount of deposits paid for securities borrowed are reflected in the receivables from brokers, dealers and clearing organizations line item in the consolidated balance sheet. Net amount of deposits received for securities loaned and derivative liabilities are reflected in the payables to brokers, dealers and clearing organizations and other liabilities line items in the consolidated balance sheet, respectively.(2)Included in the gross amounts of deposits paid for securities borrowed was $257 million and $307 million at September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively, transacted through a program with a clearing organization, which guarantees the return of cash to the Company. For presentation purposes, these amounts presented are based on the counterparties under the Company’s master securities loan agreements.E*TRADE | Q3 2017 10-Q  63  Table of Contents (3)Included in the gross amounts of deposits received for securities loaned was $801 million and $546 million at September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively, transacted through a program with a clearing organization, which guarantees the return of securities to the Company. For presentation purposes, these amounts presented are based on the counterparties under the Company’s master securities loan agreements.(4)Excludes net accrued interest payable of $1 million at September 30, 2017 and $2 million at December 31, 2016, respectively.(5)Collateral pledged included held-to-maturity securities at amortized cost at both September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016.Securities Lending TransactionsDeposits paid for securities borrowed and deposits received for securities loaned are recorded at the amount of cash collateral advanced or received. Securities borrowing transactions require the Company to deposit cash with the lender whereas securities lending transactions result in the Company receiving collateral in the form of cash, with both requiring cash in an amount generally in excess of the market value of the securities. These transactions have overnight or continuous remaining contractual maturities.Securities lending transactions expose the Company to counterparty credit risk and market risk. To manage the counterparty risk, the Company maintains internal standards for approving counterparties, reviews and analyzes the credit rating of each counterparty, and monitors its positions with each counterparty on an ongoing basis. In addition, for certain of the Company's securities lending transactions, the Company uses a program with a clearing organization that guarantees the return of securities. The Company monitors the market value of the securities borrowed and loaned using collateral arrangements that require additional collateral to be obtained from or excess collateral to be returned to the counterparties based on changes in market value, to maintain specified collateral levels.Derivative TransactionsCertain types of derivatives that the Company utilizes in its hedging activities are subject to derivatives clearing agreements (cleared derivatives contracts) under the Dodd-Frank Act. These cleared derivatives contracts enable clearing by a derivatives clearing organization through a clearing member. Under the contracts, the clearing member typically has a one-way right to offset all contracts in the event of the Company's default or bankruptcy. Collateral exchanged under these contracts is not included in the table above as the contracts may not qualify as master netting agreements. At September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the Company had $92 million and $165 million, respectively, of cleared derivative contract assets. At September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the Company had $30 million and $25 million, respectively, of cleared derivative contract liabilities.In January 2017, a clearing organization through which the Company executes certain of its derivative contracts amended its rulebook to legally characterize variation margin payments as settlements of the derivatives' exposure rather than collateral against the exposure. For these contracts, amounts exchanged with counterparties are reflected as a reduction of the related derivative assets or liabilities, including accrued interest, on the consolidated balance sheet. At September 30, 2017, the Company had derivative assets and liabilities of $10 million and $20 million, respectively, excluding accrued interest, that were settled by variation margin payments and are therefore excluded from the table above.E*TRADE | Q3 2017 10-Q  64  Table of Contents NOTE 5—AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE AND HELD-TO-MATURITY SECURITIESThe amortized cost and fair value of

At September 30, 2017, over 99% of the loans were amortizing and this portfolio will be fully converted in 2018. The home equity loan portfolio consists of HEILs and HELOCs. HEILs are primarily fully amortizing loans that do not offer the option of an interest-only payment. The majority of HELOCs had an interest only draw period at origination and converted to amortizing loans at the end of the draw period. At September 30, 2017, 1% of the HELOC portfolio had not converted from the interest-only draw period and will be fully converted in 2019.The average age of our mortgage and consumer loans receivable was 11.6 and 10.8 years at September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. Approximately 34% and 36% of the Company’s mortgage loans receivable were concentrated in California at September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. No other state had concentrations of mortgage loans that represented 10% or more of the Company’s mortgage loans receivable at September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016.E*TRADE | Q3 2017 10-Q  70  Table of Contents Delinquent LoansThe following table shows total loans receivable by delinquency category at September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 (dollars in millions):  Current 30-89 DaysDelinquent 90-179 DaysDelinquent 180+ DaysDelinquent TotalSeptember 30, 2017         One- to four-family$1,363 $56 $27 $85 $1,531Home equity1,101 42 19 35 1,197Consumer and other188 4 — — 192Total loans receivable$2,652 $102 $46 $120 $2,920December 31, 2016         One- to four-family$1,774 $67 $23 $86 $1,950Home equity1,442 43 18 53 1,556Consumer and other245 4 1 — 250Total loans receivable$3,461 $114 $42 $139 $3,756One- to four-family loans are generally secured in a first lien position by real estate assets, reducing the potential loss when compared to an unsecured loan.

In order to refine the default assumptions around the remaining population that had not yet started amortizing or that E*TRADE | Q3 2017 10-Q  72  Table of Contents had not reached 12 months post conversion, the Company evaluated whether the credit quality and performance of these loans was consistent with the seasoned amortizing portfolio. The Company determined that FICO scores, LTV/CLTVs and delinquency rates were comparable to the seasoned portfolio, and therefore applied the refined default assumptions to this remaining population. The current period benefit also reflected recoveries in excess of prior estimates, including recoveries of previous charge-offs.Impaired Loans—Troubled Debt RestructuringsThe following table shows a summary of the Company’s recorded investment in TDRs that were on accrual and nonaccrual status, further disaggregated by delinquency status, in addition to the recorded investment in TDRs at September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 (dollars in millions):   Nonaccrual TDRs   Accrual TDRs(1) Current(2) 30-89 DaysDelinquent 90-179 DaysDelinquent 180+ DaysDelinquent Total RecordedInvestment in TDRs (3)(4)September 30, 2017           One- to four-family$88 $69 $15 $9 $33 $214Home equity108 36 10 5 15 174Total$196 $105 $25 $14 $48 $388December 31, 2016           One- to four-family$97 $90 $16 $8 $35 $246Home equity119 41 10 4 21 195Total$216 $131 $26 $12 $56 $441(1)Represents loans modified as TDRs that are current and have made six or more consecutive payments.(2)Represents loans modified as TDRs that are current but have not yet made six consecutive payments, bankruptcy loans and certain junior lien TDRs that have a delinquent senior lien.

(2)Reflected in the other assets line item on the consolidated balance sheet.(3)Reflected in the other liabilities line item on the consolidated balance sheet.(4)Represents net fair value of derivative instruments for disclosure purposes only.(5)All derivatives were designated as hedging instruments at September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016.Fair Value HedgesFair value hedges are used to offset exposure to changes in value of certain fixed-rate assets. Fair value hedges are accounted for by recording the fair value of the derivative instrument and the fair value of the asset being hedged on the consolidated balance sheet. Changes in the fair value of both the derivative instruments and the underlying assets are recognized in the gains on securities and other, net line item in the consolidated statement of income. To the extent that the hedge is ineffective, the changes in the fair values will not offset and the difference, or hedge ineffectiveness, is reflected in the gains on securities and other, net line item in the consolidated statement of income.Hedge accounting is discontinued for fair value hedges if a derivative instrument is sold, terminated or otherwise de-designated. If fair value hedge accounting is discontinued, the previously hedged item is no longer adjusted for changes in fair value through the consolidated statement of income and the cumulative net gain or loss on the hedged asset or liability at the time of de-designation is amortized to interest income or interest expense using the effective interest method over the expected remaining life of the hedged item. Changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments after de-designation of fair value hedge accounting are recorded in the gains on securities and other, net line item in the consolidated statement of income.E*TRADE | Q3 2017 10-Q  76  Table of Contents The following table summarizes the effect of interest rate contracts designated as fair value hedges and related hedged items on the consolidated statement of income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017 and 2016 (dollars in millions):  Three Months Ended September 30, 2017 2016 HedgingInstrument HedgedItem HedgeIneffectiveness(1) HedgingInstrument HedgedItem HedgeIneffectiveness(1)Agency debentures$(1) $1 $— $1 $(3) $(2)Agency mortgage-backed securities4 (6) (2) 14 (16) (2)Total gains (losses) included in earnings$3 $(5) $(2) $15 $(19) $(4)             Nine Months Ended September 30, 2017 2016 HedgingInstrument HedgedItem HedgeIneffectiveness(1) HedgingInstrument HedgedItem HedgeIneffectiveness(1)Agency debentures$(7) $7 $— $(89) $85 $(4)Agency mortgage-backed securities(29) 24 (5) (100) 96 (4)Total gains (losses) included in earnings$(36) $31 $(5) $(189) $181 $(8)(1)Reflected in the gains on securities and other, net line item on the consolidated statement of income.NOTE 8—DEPOSITSDeposits are summarized as follows (dollars in millions): Amount Weighted-Average Rate September 30, 2017 December 31, 2016 September 30, 2017 December 31, 2016Sweep deposits$36,507 $26,362 0.01% 0.01%Savings deposits3,011 3,185 0.01% 0.01%Other deposits(1)(2)2,025 2,135 0.03% 0.03%Total deposits$41,543 $31,682 0.01% 0.01%(1)Includes checking deposits, money market and time deposits.(2)As of September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the Company had $202 million and $177 million in non-interest bearing deposits, respectively.E*TRADE | Q3 2017 10-Q  77  Table of Contents NOTE 9—OTHER BORROWINGSOther borrowings at September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 are summarized as follows (dollars in millions): September 30, December 31, 2017 2016FHLB advances$200 $—Trust preferred securities (1)409 409Total other borrowings$609 $409(1)Trust preferred securities begin maturing in 2031.External Lines of Credit maintained at E*TRADE SecuritiesE*TRADE Securities' external liquidity lines total approximately $1.1 billion as of September 30, 2017 and include the following:•A 364-day, $450 million senior unsecured committed revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks, with a maturity date of June 2018•Secured committed lines of credit with two unaffiliated banks, aggregating to $175 million, with a maturity date of June 2018•Unsecured uncommitted lines of credit with two unaffiliated banks aggregating to $75 million, of which $50 million has a maturity date of June 2018 and the remaining line has no maturity date•Secured uncommitted lines of credit with several unaffiliated banks aggregating to $375 million with no maturity dateThe revolving credit facility contains maintenance covenants related to E*TRADE Securities' minimum consolidated tangible net worth and regulatory net capital ratio.

E*TRADE Securities is required to maintain net capital equal to the greater of $250,000 or 2% of aggregate debit balances arising from customer transactions. The Company’s international broker-dealer subsidiary is subject to capital requirements determined by its respective regulator.The Company’s FCM subsidiary, E*TRADE Futures, is subject to CFTC net capital requirements, including the maintenance of adjusted net capital equal to or in excess of the greater of (1) $1,000,000, (2) the FCM's risk-based capital requirement, computed as 8% of the total risk margin requirements for all positions carried in customer and non-customer accounts, or (3) the amount of adjusted net capital required by the NFA. At September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, all of the Company’s broker-dealer and FCM subsidiaries met minimum net capital requirements.

Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can trigger certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on E*TRADE Financial’s and E*TRADE Bank’s financial condition and results of operations. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, E*TRADE Financial and E*TRADE Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. In addition, E*TRADE Bank may not pay dividends to the parent company without the non-E*TRADE | Q3 2017 10-Q  84  Table of Contents objection, or in certain cases the approval, of its regulators, and any loans by E*TRADE Bank to the parent company and its other non-bank subsidiaries are subject to various quantitative, arm’s length, collateralization and other requirements. E*TRADE Financial’s and E*TRADE Bank’s capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors.Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require E*TRADE Financial and E*TRADE Bank to meet minimum Tier 1 leverage, common equity Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 risk-based capital and total risk-based capital ratios. Events beyond management's control, such as deterioration in credit markets, could adversely affect future earnings and E*TRADE Financial’s and E*TRADE Bank’s ability to meet future capital requirements.

The Company establishes an accrual for losses at management's best estimate when it assesses that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company monitors these matters for developments that would affect the likelihood of a loss and the accrued amount, if any, and adjusts the amount as appropriate.Litigation MattersOn October 27, 2000, Ajaxo, Inc. (Ajaxo) filed a complaint in the Superior Court for the State of California, County of Santa Clara. Ajaxo sought damages and certain non-monetary relief for the Company’s alleged breach of a non-disclosure agreement with Ajaxo pertaining to certain wireless technology that Ajaxo offered the Company as well as damages and other relief against the Company for their alleged misappropriation of Ajaxo’s trade secrets. Following a jury trial, a judgment was entered in 2003 in favor of Ajaxo against the Company for $1 million for breach of the Ajaxo non-disclosure agreement. The trial court subsequently denied Ajaxo’s requests for additional damages and relief following which Ajaxo appealed. Although the Company paid Ajaxo the full amount due on the above-described judgment, the case was remanded back to the trial court by the California Court of Appeal, and on May 30, 2008, a jury returned a verdict in favor of the Company denying all claims raised and demands for damages against the Company. After various appeals the case was again remanded back to the trial court. Following the third trial of the matter, in a Judgment and Statement of Decision filed September 16, 2015, the Court denied all claims for royalties by Ajaxo. Ajaxo’s post-trial motions were denied. Ajaxo has appealed to the Court of Appeal, Sixth District. Briefing of this appeal is expected to continue to November 21, 2017. The Company will continue to defend itself vigorously in this matter.On May 16, 2011, Droplets Inc., the holder of two patents pertaining to user interface servers, filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas against E*TRADE Financial Corporation, E*TRADE Securities, E*TRADE Bank and multiple other unaffiliated financial services firms. The plaintiff contends that the defendants engaged in patent infringement under federal law and seeks unspecified damages and an injunction against future infringements, plus royalties, costs, interest and attorneys’ fees. On March 28, 2012, a change of venue was granted and the case was transferred to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The Company's motion for summary judgment on the grounds of non-infringement was granted by the U.S. District Court in a Decision and Order dated March 9, 2015. All remaining claims are stayed pending resolution of issues on Droplet's remaining patents under review by the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB). After a hearing, the PTAB deemed Droplets’ putative '115 patent to be “unpatentable” on June 23, 2016. In a separate proceeding, the PTAB has also separately deemed Droplets’ putative '838 patent to be “unpatentable.” Droplets has appealed to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. The briefing was completed on July 24, 2017, and oral argument has not yet been scheduled. The Company will continue to defend itself vigorously in this matter.On April 30, 2013, a putative class action was filed by John Scranton, on behalf of himself and a class of persons similarly situated, against E*TRADE Financial Corporation and E*TRADE Securities in the Superior Court of California, County of Santa Clara, pursuant to the California procedures for a private Attorney General action. The complaint alleged that the Company misrepresented through its website that it would always automatically exercise options that were in-the-money by $0.01 or more on expiration date. The plaintiffs allege violations of the California Unfair Competition Law, the California Consumer Remedies Act, fraud, misrepresentation, negligent misrepresentation and breach of fiduciary duty and plaintiffs seek unspecified damages. Final judgment was entered in the Company's favor on April 8, 2015, and the plaintiff filed an appeal. The briefing is complete and oral argument was heard on October 24, 2017. The Company will continue to defend itself vigorously in this matter.E*TRADE | Q3 2017 10-Q  86  Table of Contents On March 26, 2015, a putative class action was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California by Ty Rayner, on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated, naming E*TRADE Financial Corporation and E*TRADE Securities as defendants. The complaint alleges that E*TRADE breached a fiduciary duty and unjustly enriched itself in connection with the routing of its customers’ orders to various market-makers and exchanges. The plaintiff seeks unspecified damages, declaratory relief, restitution, disgorgement of payments received by the Company, and attorneys’ fees. On July 23, 2016, a putative class action was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York by Craig L. Schwab, on behalf of himself and others similarly situated, naming E*TRADE Financial Corporation, E*TRADE Securities, and former Company executives as defendants. The complaint alleges that E*TRADE violated federal securities laws in connection with the routing of its customers’ orders to various market-makers and exchanges. The plaintiff seeks unspecified damages, declaratory relief, restitution, disgorgement of payments received by the Company, and attorneys’ fees. By stipulation both matters are now venued in the Southern District of New York. On April 2, 2017, the District Court dismissed the complaint in Rayner. The plaintiffs in Rayner appealed. Oral argument on the appeal is scheduled for December 8, 2017. On July 10, the Court dismissed the Schwab claims without prejudice. The plaintiff in Schwab filed a third amended complaint on August 9, 2017, which E*TRADE has moved to dismiss. The Company will continue to defend itself vigorously in these matters.In addition to the matters described above, the Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the normal course of business. In each pending matter, the Company contests liability or the amount of claimed damages. In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of such matters, particularly in cases where claimants seek substantial or indeterminate damages, or where investigation or discovery have yet to be completed, the Company is unable to estimate a range of reasonably possible losses on its remaining outstanding legal proceedings; however, the Company believes any losses, both individually or in the aggregate, would not be reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition or results of operations of the Company.An unfavorable outcome in any matter could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, even if the ultimate outcomes are resolved in the Company’s favor, the defense of such litigation could entail considerable cost or the diversion of the efforts of management, either of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.Regulatory MattersThe securities, futures, foreign currency and banking industries are subject to extensive regulation under federal, state and applicable international laws. From time to time, the Company has been threatened with or named as a defendant in lawsuits, arbitrations and administrative claims involving securities, banking and other matters. The Company is also subject to periodic regulatory examinations and inspections. Compliance and trading problems that are reported to regulators, such as the SEC, FINRA, NASDAQ, CFTC, NFA, FDIC, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, OCC, or the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) by dissatisfied customers or others are investigated by such regulators, and may, if pursued, result in formal claims being filed against the Company by customers or disciplinary action being taken against the Company or its employees by regulators. Any such claims or disciplinary actions that are decided against the Company could have a material impact on the financial results of the Company or any of its subsidiaries.E*TRADE | Q3 2017 10-Q  87  Table of Contents InsuranceThe Company maintains insurance coverage that management believes is reasonable and prudent. The principal insurance coverage it maintains covers commercial general liability; property damage; hardware/software damage; cyber liability; directors and officers; employment practices liability; certain criminal acts against the Company; and errors and omissions. The Company believes that such insurance coverage is adequate for the purpose of its business. The Company’s ability to maintain this level of insurance coverage in the future, however, is subject to the availability of affordable insurance in the marketplace.CommitmentsIn the normal course of business, the Company makes various commitments to extend credit and incur contingent liabilities that are not reflected in the consolidated balance sheet. Significant changes in the economy or interest rates may influence the impact that these commitments and contingencies have on the Company in the future. The Company’s equity method, cost method and other investments are generally limited liability investments in partnerships, companies and other similar entities, including tax credit partnerships and community development entities, which are not required to be consolidated. The Company had $115 million in unfunded commitments with respect to these investments at September 30, 2017. At September 30, 2017, the Company had approximately $21 million of certificates of deposit scheduled to mature in less than one year. GuaranteesIn prior periods when the Company sold loans, the Company provided guarantees to investors purchasing mortgage loans, which are considered standard representations and warranties within the mortgage industry. The primary guarantees are that: the mortgage and the mortgage note have been duly executed and each is the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable in accordance with its terms; the mortgage has been duly acknowledged and recorded and is valid; and the mortgage and the mortgage note are not subject to any right of rescission, set-off, counterclaim or defense, including, without limitation, the defense of usury, and no such right of rescission, set-off, counterclaim or defense has been asserted with respect thereto. The Company is responsible for the guarantees on loans sold. If these claims prove to be untrue, the investor can require the Company to repurchase the loan and return all loan purchase and servicing release premiums. Management does not believe the potential liability exposure will have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows or financial condition due to the nature of the standard representations and warranties, which have resulted in a minimal amount of loan repurchases.Prior to 2008, ETBH raised capital through the formation of trusts, which sold TRUPs in the capital markets. The capital securities must be redeemed in whole at the due date, which is generally 30 years after issuance. Each trust issued TRUPs at par, with a liquidation amount of $1,000 per capital security. The trusts used the proceeds from the sale of issuances to purchase subordinated debentures issued by ETBH.During the 30-year period prior to the redemption of the TRUPs, ETBH guarantees the accrued and unpaid distributions on these securities, as well as the redemption price of the securities and certain costs that may be incurred in liquidating, terminating or dissolving the trusts (all of which would otherwise be payable by the trusts). At September 30, 2017, management estimated that the maximum potential liability under this arrangement, including the current carrying value of the trusts, was equal to approximately $416 million or the total face value of these securities plus accrued interest payable, which may be unpaid at the termination of the trust arrangement.E*TRADE | Q3 2017 10-Q  88  Table of Contents NOTE 15—SUBSEQUENT EVENTSTrust Company of America acquisitionOn October 19, 2017, we announced an agreement to acquire Trust Company of America, Inc., a leading provider of technology solutions and custody services to the independent registered investment adviser market, for $275 million in cash.
