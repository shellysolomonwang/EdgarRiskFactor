ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS  The additional risk factor presented below should be considered in addition to the risk factors previously disclosed in our 2006 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  The level of provision for loan losses in our mortgage loan portfolio may increase as a result of trends in the macro-economic environment  A substantial portion of our asset portfolio is composed of loans secured by first lien residential mortgages and second lien mortgages (home equity loans and home equity lines of credit). The overall performance of these assets can be affected by the macro trends of the economy in general and the residential real estate market, such as home price depreciation or slowing appreciation, rising mortgage interest rates and tighter mortgage lending guidelines across the industry. Such performance can also be impacted by our mix of first lien and second lien mortgages and factors particular to a given borrower. We expect nonperforming loan levels to fluctuate over time due to portfolio growth, portfolio seasoning and resolution through collections, sales or charge-offs. We increased the provision for loan losses for our first and second lien mortgages in recent periods based on the seasoning of our portfolio and higher delinquencies and charge-offs compared to 2006. Instability in the consumer credit markets and credit trends may require additional increases in our provision for loan losses, which would have an adverse effect on our results of operations in future periods.
