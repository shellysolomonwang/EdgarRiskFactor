MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (MD&A)The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this document and with the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.OVERVIEWCompany OverviewE*TRADE is a financial services company that provides online brokerage and related products and services primarily to individual retail investors. Our business is organized into three product areas: Trading, Investing and Corporate Services. Additionally, we offer banking and cash management capabilities, including deposit accounts insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), which are fully integrated into customer brokerage accounts.Our mission is to enhance the financial independence of traders and investors through a powerful digital offering and professional guidance. Our vision is to be the #1 digital broker and advisor to traders and investors, known for ease of use and the completeness of our offering. We operate directly and through several subsidiaries, many of which are overseen by governmental and self-regulatory organizations. Our most important subsidiaries are described below:•E*TRADE Securities LLC (E*TRADE Securities) is a registered broker-dealer that clears and settles customer securities transactions. •E*TRADE Bank is a federally chartered savings bank that provides FDIC insurance on qualifying amounts of customer deposits and provides other banking and cash management capabilities. •E*TRADE Savings Bank, a subsidiary of E*TRADE Bank, is a federally chartered savings bank that provides FDIC insurance on qualifying amounts of customer deposits, and now also provides custody solutions to Registered Investment Advisers (RIAs) as the acquisition of Trust Company of America (TCA) was completed in April 2018. •E*TRADE Financial Corporate Services is a provider of software and services for managing equity compensation plans to our corporate clients. The Corporate Services channel is an important driver of brokerage account and asset growth.•E*TRADE Futures LLC (E*TRADE Futures) is a registered non-clearing Futures Commission Merchant (FCM) that provides clearing and settlement services for customer futures transactions. •E*TRADE Capital Management, LLC (E*TRADE Capital Management) is a registered investment adviser that provides investment advisory services for our customers.E*TRADE Q1 2018 10-Q | Page 3  Table of Contents StrategyOur business strategy is centered on two key objectives: accelerating the growth of our core brokerage business to improve market share, and generating robust earnings growth and healthy returns on capital to deliver long-term value for our shareholders.Accelerate Growth of Core Brokerage Business•Enhance overall customer experienceWe are focused on delivering cutting-edge trading solutions while improving our market position in investing products. Through these offerings, we aim to continue growing our customer base while deepening engagement with our existing customers.•Capitalize on value of corporate services channelOur corporate services channel is a strategically important driver of brokerage account and asset growth. We leverage our industry-leading position in corporate stock plan administration to improve client acquisition and engage with plan participants to bolster awareness of our full suite of offerings. Generate Robust Earnings Growth and Healthy Returns on Capital•Utilize balance sheet to enhance returnsWe utilize our bank structure to effectively monetize brokerage relationships by investing stable, low-cost deposits primarily in agency mortgage-backed securities. Meanwhile, we continue to manage down the size and risk associated with our legacy mortgage and consumer loan portfolio.•Put capital to work for shareholdersAs we continue to deliver on our capital plan initiatives, we are focused on generating and effectively deploying excess capital, including through our share repurchase program, for the benefit of our shareholders.Financial PerformanceOur net revenue is generated primarily from net interest income, commissions and fees and service charges. Net interest income is largely impacted by the size of our balance sheet, our balance sheet mix, and average yields on our assets and liabilities. Net interest income is driven primarily from interest earned on investment securities and margin receivables, less interest incurred on interest-bearing liabilities, including deposits, customer payables, corporate debt and other borrowings. Net interest income is also earned on our legacy mortgage and consumer loan portfolio which we expect to continue to run off in future periods. Commissions revenue is generated by customer trades and is largely impacted by trade volume and commission rates. Fees and service charges revenue is mainly impacted by order flow revenue, fees earned on off-balance sheet customer cash and other assets, mutual fund service fees and advisor management fees. Our net revenue is offset by non-interest expenses, the largest of which are compensation and benefits and advertising and market development.E*TRADE Q1 2018 10-Q | Page 4  Table of Contents Significant Events in the First Quarter of 2018Announced acquisition of brokerage accounts from Capital One In January 2018, we announced an agreement to acquire approximately one million retail brokerage accounts with $18 billion in customer assets from Capital One for a cash purchase price of up to $170 million. We intend to fund this transaction with existing cash. The acquisition is expected to close by the third quarter of 2018, subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals.Completed Trust Company of America acquisitionOn April 9, 2018, we completed the acquisition of TCA for a cash purchase price of $275 million. The acquisition is expected to benefit the Company as the RIA portion of our industry is growing and the Company expects to leverage the E*TRADE brand to accelerate growth. The Company also expects this acquisition to help bolster the Company's ability to retain customers in need of specialized customer service engagement. For additional information, see Note 15—Subsequent Event. Repurchased 2.7 million shares of our common stockWe continued to execute on our share repurchase program, under which the Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of up to $1 billion of shares of our common stock.

As of March 31, 2018, we have repurchased 11.2 million shares of common stock at an average price of $44.91 for a total of $502 million since we began repurchasing shares under this authorization in the third quarter of 2017. As of March 31, 2018, $498 million remained available for additional repurchases. As of April 30, 2018, we have subsequently repurchased an additional 0.9 million shares of common stock at an average price of $60.01.Tier 1 leverage ratio threshold reduced for E*TRADE BankBeginning January 2018, E*TRADE Bank's Tier 1 leverage ratio threshold was reduced to 7.0% from the previous threshold of 7.5%.E*TRADE Q1 2018 10-Q | Page 5  Table of Contents Key Performance MetricsManagement monitors a number of customer activity and company metrics to evaluate the Company’s performance.

Customer margin balances were $10.5 billion and $7.3 billion at March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Customer assets is an indicator of the value of our relationship with the customer. An increase generally indicates that the use of our products and services by existing and new customers is expanding. Changes in this metric are also driven by changes in the valuations of our customers' underlying securities. Customer assets were $392.8 billion and $335.7 billion at March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.Brokerage related cash is an indicator of the level of engagement with our brokerage customers and is a key driver of net interest income as well as fees and service charges revenue, which includes fees earned on customer cash held by third parties. Brokerage related cash was $51.9 billion and $53.5 billion at March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.E*TRADE Q1 2018 10-Q | Page 8  Table of Contents Net new brokerage assets is total inflows to new and existing brokerage accounts less total outflows from closed and existing brokerage accounts. The net new brokerage assets metric is a general indicator of the use of our products and services by new and existing brokerage customers. Net new brokerage assets were $5.3 billion and $4.2 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. During the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, our annualized net new brokerage asset growth rate was 6.3% and 6.1%, respectively.Managed products represents customer assets in our Core Portfolio, Blend Portfolio, Dedicated Portfolio and Fixed Income Portfolios.

Operating margin was 47% and 41% for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.Adjusted operating margin is a non-GAAP measure that provides useful information about our ongoing operating performance by excluding the provision (benefit) for loan losses and losses on early extinguishment of debt, which are not viewed as key factors governing our investment in the business and are excluded by management when evaluating operating margin performance. Adjusted operating margin was 44% and 38% for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. See MD&A—Earnings Overview for a reconciliation of adjusted operating margin to operating margin.Corporate cash, a non-GAAP measure, is a component of cash and equivalents and represents the primary source of capital above and beyond the capital deployed in our regulated subsidiaries. Cash and equivalents was $498 million and $998 million at March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, while corporate cash was $439 million and $417 million for the same periods.

Average interest-earning assets were $59.8 billion and $48.7 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.Net interest margin is a measure of the net yield on our average interest-earning assets. Net interest margin is calculated for a given period by dividing the annualized sum of net interest income by average interest-earning assets. Net interest margin was 2.97% and 2.63% for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Total employees were 3,768 and 3,629 at March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.Regulatory DevelopmentsIn April 2016, the US Department of Labor (DOL) published its final Conflicts of Interest Rule- Retirement Investment Advice regulations under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (Fiduciary Rule). Certain aspects of the Fiduciary Rule became applicable in June 2017. The Fiduciary Rule generally subjects particular persons, such as broker-dealers and other financial advisers providing investment advice to individual retirement accounts and other qualified retirement plans and accounts, to fiduciary duties and additional regulatory restrictions for a wider range of customer interactions. The DOL extended the transition period for the remaining aspects of the Fiduciary Rule, currently scheduled to take effect on July 1, 2019. On March 5, 2018, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals vacated the Fiduciary Rule in its entirety. If the decision is not reviewed or appealed, the Fiduciary Rule will be nullified as if it had not been adopted.E*TRADE Q1 2018 10-Q | Page 11  Table of Contents EARNINGS OVERVIEWWe generated net income of $247 million on total net revenue of $708 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018. The following chart presents a reconciliation of net income for the three months ended March 31, 2017 to net income for the three months ended March 31, 2018 (dollars in millions):(1)Includes clearing and servicing, professional services, occupancy and equipment, depreciation and amortization, FDIC insurance premiums, amortization of other intangibles, restructuring and acquisition-related activities and other non-interest expenses. E*TRADE Q1 2018 10-Q | Page 12  Table of Contents The following table presents significant components of the consolidated statement of income (dollars in millions except per share amounts): Three Months Ended March 31, Variance  2018 vs. 2017 2018 2017 Amount %Net interest income$445 $319 $126 39 %Total non-interest income263 234 29 12 %Total net revenue708 553 155 28 %Provision (benefit) for loan losses(21) (14) (7) 50 %Total non-interest expense395 342 53 15 %Income before income tax expense334 225 109 48 %Income tax expense87 80 7 9 %Net income$247 $145 $102 70 %Preferred stock dividends12 13 (1) (8)%Net income available to common shareholders$235 $132 $103 78 %Diluted earnings per common share$0.88 $0.48 $0.4083 %Net income increased 70% to $247 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017. Net income available to common shareholders was $235 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, which reflects $12 million in preferred stock dividends, compared to $132 million, which reflects $13 million in preferred stock dividends, during the same period in 2017. The increase in net income was primarily driven by higher interest income due to a larger average balance sheet and an improvement in net interest margin, as well as higher fees and service charges. A lower effective tax rate resulting from federal tax reform also added to the increase. The increase in net income was partially offset by higher non-interest expense primarily due to increased compensation and benefits and advertising and market development expenses. Net RevenueThe following table presents the significant components of net revenue (dollars in millions): Three Months Ended March 31, Variance  2018 vs. 2017 2018 2017 Amount %Net interest income$445 $319 $126 39%Commissions137 127 10 8%Fees and service charges105 86 19 22%Gains on securities and other, net10 10 — —%Other revenue11 11 — —%Total non-interest income263 234 29 12%Total net revenue$708 $553 $155 28%Net Interest IncomeNet interest income increased 39% to $445 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to the same period in 2017. Net interest income is earned primarily through investment securities, margin receivables and our legacy mortgage and consumer loan portfolio, offset by funding costs. Our investment grade debt refinancing in the third quarter of 2017 reduced our funding costs and improved our ability to generate net interest income.E*TRADE Q1 2018 10-Q | Page 13  Table of Contents The following table presents average balance sheet data and interest income and expense data, as well as the related net interest margin, yields and rates (dollars in millions): Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Average Balance Interest Inc./Exp.

Hedge ineffectiveness for the prior periods continues to be reflected within the gains on securities and other, net line item. See Note 7- Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities for additional information. (2)Nonaccrual loans are included in the average loan balances. Interest payments received on nonaccrual loans are recognized on a cash basis in interest income until it is doubtful that full payment will be collected, at which point payments are applied to principal.(3)Represents interest income on securities loaned.(4)Represents interest expense on securities borrowed.Average interest-earning assets increased 23% to $59.8 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017. The fluctuation in interest-earning assets is generally driven by changes in interest-bearing liabilities, primarily deposits and customer payables. Average interest-bearing liabilities increased 22% to $56.2 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017. The increase was primarily due to higher deposits as a result of transferring customer cash held by third parties to our balance sheet. Net interest margin increased 34 basis points to 2.97% for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017. Net interest margin is driven by the mix of asset and liability average balances and the interest rates earned or paid on those balances. The increase during the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to 2017 is due to higher interest rates earned on increased margin receivables and investment securities balances, increased securities lending activities and lower corporate E*TRADE Q1 2018 10-Q | Page 14  Table of Contents debt service cost, partially offset by the continued run-off of our higher yielding legacy mortgage and consumer loan portfolio.CommissionsCommissions revenue increased 8% to $137 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017. The main factors that affect commissions revenue are DARTs, average commission per trade and the number of trading days. DARTs volume increased 49% to 309,469 for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to the same period in 2017, mainly driven by continued improved market sentiment along with the higher volatility of the equity markets. Derivative DARTs volume increased 65% to 97,658 for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017. Derivative DARTs represented 32% and 29% of trading volume for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Average commission per trade decreased 26% to $7.27 for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017. Average commission per trade is impacted by customer mix and differing commission rates on various trade types (e.g. equities, derivatives, stock plan and mutual funds). Average commission per trade for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was impacted by reduced commission rates implemented in March 2017 as well as increased trading activity from certain customers, qualifying them for lower active trader commission pricing.Fees and Service ChargesThe following table presents the significant components of fees and service charges (dollars in millions):  Three Months Ended March 31, Variance  2018 vs. 2017 2018 2017 Amount %Order flow revenue$47 $31 $16 52 %Money market funds and sweep deposits revenue(1)17 22 (5) (23)%Mutual fund service fees11 9 2 22 %Advisor management fees11 8 3 38 %Foreign exchange revenue8 8 — — %Reorganization fees3 3 — — %Other fees and service charges8 5 3 60 %Total fees and service charges$105 $86 $19 22 %(1)Includes revenue earned on average customer cash held by third parties based on the federal funds rate or LIBOR plus a negotiated spread or other contractual arrangements with the third party institutions.Fees and service charges increased 22% to $105 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 primarily driven by increased order flow revenue due to higher trade volume and improved rates. This increase was partially offset by decreased money market funds and sweep deposits revenue driven by lower customer cash balances held by third parties due to transferring cash onto our balance sheet. The impact of the lower balances was partially offset by a higher gross yield of 135 basis points for the three months ended March 31, 2018 as compared to approximately 60 basis points in 2017.E*TRADE Q1 2018 10-Q | Page 15  Table of Contents Gains on Securities and Other, NetThe following table presents the significant components of gains on securities and other, net (dollars in millions): Three Months Ended March 31, Variance  2018 vs. 2017 2018 2017 Amount %Gains on available-for-sale securities$11 $8 $3 38 %Equity method investment income (loss) and other(1)(1) 2 (3) (150)%Gains on securities and other, net$10 $10 $— — %(1)Includes a loss of $1 million on hedge ineffectiveness for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Beginning January 1, 2018, fair value hedging adjustments are recognized within net interest income. See Note 1—Organization, basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies for additional information. Provision (Benefit) for Loan LossesWe recognized a benefit for loan losses of $21 million and $14 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The timing and magnitude of the provision (benefit) for loan losses is affected by many factors that could result in variability. These benefits reflected better than expected performance of our portfolio as well as recoveries in excess of prior expectations, including recoveries of previous charge-offs that were not included in our loss estimates. For additional information on management's estimate of the allowance for loan losses, see Note 6—Loans Receivable, Net.Non-Interest ExpenseThe following table presents the significant components of non-interest expense (dollars in millions): Three Months Ended March 31, Variance  2018 vs. 2017 2018 2017 Amount %Compensation and benefits$152 $136 $16 12 %Advertising and market development60 43 17 40 %Clearing and servicing36 32 4 13 %Professional services22 22 — — %Occupancy and equipment30 27 3 11 %Communications31 25 6 24 %Depreciation and amortization22 20 2 10 %FDIC insurance premiums9 8 1 13 %Amortization of other intangibles10 9 1 11 %Restructuring and acquisition-related activities— 4 (4) (100)%Other non-interest expenses23 16 7 44 %Total non-interest expense$395 $342 $53 15 %Compensation and BenefitsCompensation and benefits expense increased 12% to $152 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017. The expense increase was primarily driven by a 4% increase in headcount to support the growth in our business along with higher payroll taxes and incentive compensation related to strong company performance. E*TRADE Q1 2018 10-Q | Page 16  Table of Contents Advertising and Market DevelopmentAdvertising and market development expense increased 40% to $60 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017. This planned increase was primarily due to higher media and brand production spend resulting from our increased focus on accelerating the growth of our business by increasing engagement across new and existing customers.CommunicationsCommunications expense increased 24% to $31 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017. The increase was driven primarily by increased market data fees resulting from higher trading activity and the impact of higher rates for professional users.Other Non-Interest ExpensesOther non-interest expenses increased 44% to $23 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017. The increase was primarily driven by $5 million in losses related to margin lending activity and futures transactions due to high market volatility experienced in early February 2018.Operating MarginOperating margin was 47% for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to 41% for the same period in 2017. Adjusted operating margin, a non-GAAP measure, was 44% for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to 38% for the same period in 2017.Adjusted operating margin is a non-GAAP measure calculated by dividing adjusted income before income tax expense by total net revenue. Adjusted income before income tax expense excludes provision (benefit) for loan losses.

The level of segregated cash is driven largely by customer payables and securities lending balances we hold as liabilities compared with the amount of margin receivables and securities borrowed balances we hold as assets. The excess represents customer cash that we are required by our regulators to segregate for the exclusive benefit of our brokerage customers. At March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, $750 million and $800 million, respectively, of reverse repurchase agreements between E*TRADE Securities and E*TRADE Bank, representing investments that were segregated under federal or other regulations by E*TRADE Securities, were eliminated in consolidation.

Loans receivable, net decreased 6% to $2.5 billion during the three months ended March 31, 2018. We expect the remaining legacy mortgage and consumer loan portfolio to continue its run-off for the foreseeable future. As our portfolio has seasoned and substantially all interest-only loans have converted to amortizing, we continue to assess underlying performance, the economic environment, and the value of the portfolio in the marketplace.

The increase was driven by funding requirements at E*TRADE Securities, primarily to support increased margin lending activity. For additional information on E*TRADE Securities liquidity, see MD&A—Liquidity and Capital Resources.E*TRADE Q1 2018 10-Q | Page 22  Table of Contents LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESWe have established liquidity and capital policies to support the successful execution of our business strategy, while maintaining ongoing and sufficient liquidity through the business cycle. We believe liquidity is of critical importance to the Company and especially important for E*TRADE Bank and E*TRADE Securities. The objective of our policies is to ensure that we can meet our corporate, banking and broker-dealer liquidity needs under both normal operating conditions and under periods of stress in the financial markets. LiquidityOur corporate liquidity needs are primarily driven by capital needs at E*TRADE Bank and E*TRADE Securities as well as by the interest due on our corporate debt and the amount of dividend payments on our preferred stock. Our banking and brokerage subsidiaries' liquidity needs are driven primarily by the level and volatility of our customer activity. Management maintains a set of liquidity sources and monitors certain business trends and market metrics closely in an effort to ensure we have sufficient liquidity. Potential loans by E*TRADE Bank to the parent company and the parent company's other non-bank subsidiaries are subject to various quantitative, arm’s length, collateralization, capital and other requirements. As a result of the Company's balance sheet growth, we became subject to the modified liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) requirement beginning April 1, 2018. The modified LCR rule requires us to hold at least 70% of our projected net cash outflows over a 30-day period in high-quality liquid assets. The Company believes the LCR is an important measure of liquidity and has been managing against it in preparation for the applicability of these requirements. Parent Company LiquidityThe parent company's primary source of liquidity is corporate cash. Corporate cash, a non-GAAP measure, is a component of cash and equivalents; see the consolidated statement of cash flows for information on cash and equivalents activity. We define corporate cash as cash held at the parent company and subsidiaries, excluding bank, broker-dealer, and FCM subsidiaries that require regulatory approval or notification prior to the payment of certain dividends to the parent company.We believe corporate cash is a useful measure of the parent company’s liquidity as it is the primary source of capital above and beyond the capital deployed in our regulated subsidiaries. Corporate cash can fluctuate in any given quarter and is impacted primarily by the following:•Dividends from and investments in subsidiaries•Non-cumulative preferred stock dividends •Share repurchases•Debt service costs•Acquisitions and other investments•Reimbursements from subsidiaries for the use of the parent company's deferred tax assets•Parent company overhead less reimbursements through cost sharing arrangements with subsidiariesE*TRADE Q1 2018 10-Q | Page 23  Table of Contents The following chart provides a roll forward of corporate cash at December 31, 2017 to corporate cash at March 31, 2018 (dollars in millions):The following table presents a reconciliation of consolidated cash and equivalents to corporate cash, a non-GAAP measure (dollars in millions): March 31, December 31, March 31, 2018 2017 2017Consolidated cash and equivalents$498 $931 $998Less: Cash at regulated subsidiaries(1)(59) (390) (581)Corporate cash$439 $541 $417(1)Reported net of corporate cash on deposit at E*TRADE Bank that is eliminated in consolidation. Corporate cash decreased $102 million to $439 million during the three months ended March 31, 2018 primarily due to the following: •$140 million used for share repurchases•$78 million used primarily for parent company overhead less reimbursements from subsidiaries under cost sharing arrangements•$125 million received in dividends from E*TRADE Securities Corporate cash is monitored as part of our liquidity risk management and our current corporate cash target is $250 million. This target covers approximately 18 months of parent company fixed costs, which includes preferred stock dividends, debt service and other overhead costs. The Company maintains $300 million of additional liquidity through an unsecured committed revolving credit facility. The parent has the ability to borrow against the credit facility for working capital and general corporate purposes. At March 31, 2018, there was no outstanding balance under this credit facility.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.E*TRADE Bank LiquidityE*TRADE Bank, including its subsidiary E*TRADE Savings Bank, relies on bank cash and deposits for liquidity needs. Management believes that within deposits, sweep deposits are of particular importance as they are a stable source of liquidity for E*TRADE Bank. We have the ability to generate liquidity in the form of additional deposits by raising the yield on our customer deposit products. Sweep deposits on our balance sheet as of March 31, 2018 increased $0.2 billion compared to December 31, 2017. We utilize our sweep deposit platform to efficiently manage our balance sheet size.We may utilize wholesale funding sources for short-term liquidity and contingency funding requirements. Our ability to borrow these funds is dependent upon the continued availability of funding in the wholesale borrowings market. In addition, we can borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond's discount window to meet short-term liquidity requirements, although it is not viewed as a primary source of funding. At March 31, 2018, E*TRADE Bank had $5.4 billion and $0.7 billion in additional collateralized borrowing capacity with the FHLB and the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, respectively. E*TRADE Securities LiquidityE*TRADE Securities relies on customer payables, securities lending, and internal and external lines of credit to provide liquidity and to fund margin lending. At March 31, 2018, E*TRADE Securities' external liquidity lines totaled approximately $1.1 billion and included the following:•A 364-day, $450 million senior unsecured committed revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks, with a maturity date in June 2018 and a commitment fee of 0.35% on unused balances•Secured committed lines of credit with two unaffiliated banks, aggregating to $175 million, with a maturity date in June 2018 and a commitment fee of 0.15% on unused balances•Unsecured uncommitted lines of credit with three unaffiliated banks, aggregating to $125 million, of which $50 million matures in June 2018 and the remaining lines have no maturity date•Secured uncommitted lines of credit with several unaffiliated banks, aggregating to $375 million with no maturity dateThe revolving credit facility contains certain covenants, including maintenance covenants related to E*TRADE Securities' minimum consolidated tangible net worth and regulatory net capital ratio. There were no outstanding balances for any of these lines at March 31, 2018. E*TRADE Securities also maintains lines of credit with the parent company and E*TRADE Bank.Capital ResourcesThe Company seeks to manage capital levels in support of our business strategy of generating and effectively deploying capital for the benefit of our shareholders, governed by the Company's risk management framework. For additional information on our bank and brokerage capital requirements, see Note 13—Regulatory Requirements.E*TRADE Q1 2018 10-Q | Page 25  Table of Contents Bank Capital RequirementsThe Dodd-Frank Act requires all companies, including savings and loan holding companies, that directly or indirectly control an insured depository institution, to serve as a source of strength for the institution. There are bank regulatory capital requirements applicable to the Company and E*TRADE Bank, some of which are still subject to phase-in periods, including certain deductions from and adjustments to regulatory capital. Most of these requirements became fully implemented as of January 1, 2018. For additional information on bank regulatory requirements and phase-in periods, see Overview—Regulatory Developments as well as Part I. Item 1. Business—Regulation in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.

At March 31, 2018, these subsidiaries met their minimum net capital requirements. We continue to assess our ability to distribute excess net capital to the parent while maintaining adequate capital at the broker-dealer and FCM subsidiaries. E*TRADE Securities paid dividends of $125 million to the parent company during the three months ended March 31, 2018. For additional information on our broker-dealer and FCM capital requirements, see Note 13—Regulatory Requirements.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe enter into various off-balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business, primarily to meet the needs of our customers and to reduce our own exposure to interest rate risk. These arrangements include firm commitments to extend credit. Additionally, we enter into guarantees and other similar arrangements as part of transactions in the ordinary course of business. For additional information on these arrangements, see Note 14—Commitments, Contingencies and Other Regulatory Matters.RISK MANAGEMENTThe identification, mitigation and management of existing and potential risks is critical to effective enterprise risk management. There are certain risks inherent to our industry (e.g. execution of transactions) and certain risks that will surface through the conduct of our business operations. We seek to monitor and manage our significant risk exposures by operating under a set of Board-approved limits and by monitoring certain risk indicators. Our governance framework is designed to comply with applicable requirements and requires regular reporting on metrics and significant risks and exposures to senior management and the Board of Directors. We face the following key types of risks: credit, liquidity, market, operational, information security, data, strategic, reputational, legal, as well as regulatory and compliance. We have a Board-approved Enterprise Risk Appetite Statement (RAS) that is provided to all employees. The RAS specifies significant risk exposures and addresses the Company's tolerance of those risks, which are described in further detail within Part II. Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.We are also subject to other risks that could affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows in future periods. For additional information see Part I. Item 1A.— Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISKCredit risk is the risk of loss arising from the inability or failure of a borrower or counterparty to meet its credit obligations. Our mortgage loan portfolio represents our most significant credit risk exposure. See Part II. Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 for additional information on our management of credit risk. One- to Four-Family Interest-Only LoansOne- to four-family loans include loans with a five to ten year interest-only period, followed by an amortizing period ranging from 20 to 25 years. At March 31, 2018, nearly 100% of these loans were amortizing.E*TRADE Q1 2018 10-Q | Page 29  Table of Contents Home Equity LoansThe home equity loan portfolio consists of home equity installment loans (HEILs) and home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) and is primarily second lien loans on residential real estate properties that have a higher level of credit risk than first lien mortgage loans. HEILs are primarily fixed rate and fixed term, fully amortizing loans that do not offer the option of an interest-only payment. The majority of HELOCs had an interest-only draw period at origination and converted to amortizing loans at the end of the draw period, which typically ranged from five to ten years. At March 31, 2018, nearly 100% of the HELOC portfolio had converted from the interest-only draw period.SecuritiesWe focus primarily on security type and credit rating to monitor credit risk in our securities portfolios. We consider securities backed by the US government or its agencies to have low credit risk as the long-term debt rating of the US government is AA+ by S&P and Aaa by Moody’s at March 31, 2018. The amortized cost of these securities accounted for over 99% of our total securities portfolio at March 31, 2018. We review the remaining debt securities that were not backed by the US government or its agencies according to their credit ratings from S&P and Moody’s where available. At March 31, 2018, all municipal bonds in our securities portfolio were rated investment grade (defined as a rating equivalent to a Moody’s rating of "Baa3" or higher, or an S&P rating of “BBB-“ or higher).SUMMARY OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATESThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in conformity with GAAP. Note 1—Organization, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, contains a summary of our significant accounting policies, many of which require the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and related notes for the periods presented. We believe that of our significant accounting policies, the following are critical because they are based on estimates and assumptions that require complex and subjective judgments by management: allowance for loan losses; valuation and impairment of goodwill and acquired intangible assets; and estimates of effective tax rates, deferred taxes and valuation allowance. Changes in these estimates or assumptions could materially impact our financial condition and results of operations, and actual results could differ from our estimates. Our critical accounting policies are more fully described in Part II. Item 7.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKThe following discussion about market risk includes forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including, but not limited to, those set forth in Part I. Item 1a. Risk Factors in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017. Interest Rate RiskOur exposure to interest rate risk is related primarily to interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Managing interest rate risk is essential to profitability. The primary objective of the management of interest rate risk is to control exposure to interest rates within the Board-approved limits and with limited exposure to earnings volatility resulting from interest rate fluctuations. Our general strategies to manage interest rate risk include balancing variable-rate and fixed-rate assets and liabilities and utilizing derivatives to help manage exposures to changes in interest rates. Exposure to interest rate risk requires management to make complex assumptions regarding maturities, market interest rates and customer behavior. Changes in interest rates, including the following, could impact interest income and expense:•Interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities may re-price at different times or by different amounts, creating a mismatch.•The yield curve may steepen, flatten or otherwise change shape, which could affect the spread between short- and long-term rates. Widening or narrowing spreads could impact net interest income.•Market interest rates may influence prepayments, resulting in maturity mismatches. In addition, prepayments could impact yields as premiums and discounts amortize.Exposure to interest rate risk is dependent upon the distribution and composition of interest-earning assets, interest-bearing liabilities and derivatives. The differing risk characteristics of each product are managed to mitigate our exposure to interest rate fluctuations. At March 31, 2018, 94% of our total assets were interest-earning assets and we had no securities classified as trading.At March 31, 2018, 68% of total assets were available-for-sale and held-to-maturity mortgage-backed securities and residential real estate loans. The values of these assets are sensitive to changes in interest rates as well as expected prepayment levels. As interest rates increase, fixed-rate residential mortgages and mortgage-backed securities tend to exhibit lower prepayments. The inverse is true in a falling rate environment.When real estate loans are prepaid, unamortized premiums and/or discounts are recognized immediately in interest income. Depending on the timing of the prepayment, these adjustments to income would impact anticipated yields. The Company reviews estimates of the impact of changing market rates on prepayments. This information is incorporated into our interest rate risk management strategy.Our liability structure consists of two central sources of funding: deposits and customer payables, both of which re-price at management’s discretion. We may utilize securities lending and wholesale funding sources as needed for short-term liquidity and contingency funding requirements. Derivative InstrumentsWe use derivative instruments to help manage interest rate risk using designated hedge relationships. Interest rate swaps involve the exchange of fixed-rate and variable-rate interest payments between two parties based on a contractual underlying notional amount, but do not involve the exchange of the underlying notional amounts. See Note 7—Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities for additional information about our use of derivative contracts.E*TRADE Q1 2018 10-Q | Page 31  Table of Contents Scenario AnalysisScenario analysis is an advanced approach to estimating interest rate risk exposure. The Company monitors interest rate risk using the Economic Value of Equity (EVE) approach and the Earnings-at-Risk (EAR) approach. Under the EVE approach, the present value of expected cash flows of all existing interest-earning assets, interest-bearing liabilities, derivatives and forward commitments are estimated and combined to produce an EVE figure. The change in EVE is a long-term sensitivity measure of interest rate risk. The approach values only the current balance sheet in which the most significant assumptions are the prepayment rates of the loan portfolio and mortgage-backed securities and the repricing of deposits. This approach does not incorporate assumptions related to business growth, or liquidation and re-investment of instruments. This approach provides an indicator of future earnings and capital levels because changes in EVE indicate the anticipated change in the value of future cash flows. The sensitivity of this value to changes in interest rates is then determined by applying alternative interest rate scenarios. The change in EVE amounts fluctuate based on instantaneous parallel shifts in interest rates primarily due to the change in timing of cash flows, which considers prepayment estimates, in the Company’s residential loan and mortgage-backed securities portfolios.EAR is a short-term sensitivity measure of interest rate risk and illustrates the impact of alternative interest rate scenarios on net interest income, including corporate interest expense, over a twelve month time frame. In measuring the sensitivity of net interest income to changes in interest rates, we assume instantaneous parallel interest rate shocks applied to the forward curve. In addition, we assume that cash flows from loan payoffs are reinvested in mortgage-backed securities, we exclude revenue from off-balance sheet customer cash and we assume no balance sheet growth.The following table presents the sensitivity of EVE and EAR at the consolidated E*TRADE Financial level (dollars in millions):Instantaneous Parallel Change in Interest Rates (basis points) (1) Economic Value of Equity Earnings-at-Risk March 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 March 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 Amount Percentage Amount Percentage Amount Percentage Amount Percentage+200 $(155) (1.8)% $(172) (2.1)% $217 11.9 % $197 11.5 %+100 $4 — % $(23) (0.3)% $116 6.4 % $113 6.6 %-50 $(154) (1.8)% $(225) (2.7)% $(100) (5.5)% $(102) (6.0)%(1)These scenario analyses assume a balance sheet size as of the dates indicated. Any changes in size would cause the amounts to vary.We actively manage interest rate risk positions. As interest rates change, we will adjust our strategy and mix of assets, liabilities and derivatives to optimize our position. For example, a 100 basis points increase in rates may not result in a change in value as indicated above. We compare the instantaneous parallel shift in interest rate changes in EVE and EAR to the established limits set by the Board of Directors in order to assess interest rate risk. In the event that the percentage change in EVE or EAR exceeds the Board limits, our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Risk Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer must all be promptly notified in writing and decide upon a plan of remediation. In addition, the Board of Directors must be notified of the exception and the planned resolution. At March 31, 2018, the EVE and EAR percentage changes were within our Board limits.E*TRADE Q1 2018 10-Q | Page 32  Table of Contents KEY TERMSActive customers—Customers that have an account with a balance of $25 or more or a trade in the last six months.Active trader—Customers that execute 30 or more trades per quarter.

1—ORGANIZATION, BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIESOrganizationE*TRADE Financial Corporation is a financial services company that provides brokerage and related products and services primarily to individual retail investors under the brand "E*TRADE Financial." The Company also provides investor-focused banking products, primarily sweep deposits, to retail investors. Basis of PresentationThe condensed consolidated financial statements, also referred to herein as the consolidated financial statements, include the accounts of the Company and its majority-owned subsidiaries as determined under the voting interest model. Entities in which the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence but in which the Company does not possess control are generally accounted for by the equity method. Entities in which the Company does not have the ability to exercise significant influence are generally carried at cost, or, to the extent that a readily determinable fair value is available, at fair value through net income. The Company also evaluates its initial and continuing involvement with certain entities to determine if the Company is required to consolidate the entities under the variable interest entity (VIE) model. This evaluation is based on a qualitative assessment of whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of the VIE, which requires the Company to possess both: 1) the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the VIE; and 2) the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. The consolidated financial statements do not include any consolidated VIEs for all periods presented.The Company's consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. Intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. These consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, which are normal and recurring in nature, necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. Beginning January 1, 2018, the Company updated the presentation of the consolidated financial statements as follows:•On the consolidated balance sheet, deferred tax assets, net has been reclassified to other assets. The prior period has been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. Deferred tax assets, net were $218 million and $251 million at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. •On the consolidated balance sheet, publicly traded equity securities are presented within other assets as a result of the adoption of amended accounting guidance. The prior period has not been reclassified as the amended accounting guidance was adopted on a modified retrospective basis. Accordingly, publicly traded equity securities for the prior period are presented within available-for-sale securities. •On the consolidated statement of income, fair value hedging adjustments, previously referred to as hedge ineffectiveness, are included within net interest income as a result of the adoption of new accounting guidance. Prior period amounts have not been reclassified to current period presentation and continue to be reflected within gains on securities and other, net. Fair value hedging adjustments were expenses of $3 million and $1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2017, respectively. E*TRADE Q1 2018 10-Q | Page 44  Table of ContentsE*TRADE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)Use of EstimatesPreparing the Company's consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and related notes for the periods presented. Actual results could differ from management’s estimates. Certain significant accounting policies are critical because they are based on estimates and assumptions that require complex and subjective judgments by management. Changes in these estimates or assumptions could materially impact the Company’s financial condition and results of operations. Material estimates in which management believes changes could reasonably occur include: allowance for loan losses, valuation of goodwill and acquired intangible assets and estimates of effective tax rates, deferred taxes and valuation allowance.Adoption of New Accounting StandardsRevenue from Contracts with CustomersIn May 2014, the FASB amended the guidance on revenue from contracts with customers. The new standard outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to apply in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers. The Company's accounting for net interest income was not impacted by the new standard. The FASB issued supplemental amendments to the new standard to clarify certain guidance and to provide narrow scope improvements and practical expedients during 2016. The amended guidance became effective on January 1, 2018 and the Company adopted the guidance on a modified retrospective basis. This adoption did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows as the satisfaction of performance obligations under the new guidance is materially consistent with the Company's previous revenue recognition policies. Similarly, the amended guidance did not have a material impact on the recognition of costs incurred to obtain new contracts. For additional information on the Company's adoption of the amended guidance, see Note 2—Net Revenue. Classification and Measurement of Financial InstrumentsIn January 2016, the FASB amended the accounting and disclosure guidance on the classification and measurement of financial instruments. Relevant changes in the amended guidance include the requirement that equity investments, excluding those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those resulting in consolidation of the investee, be measured at fair value in the consolidated balance sheet with changes in fair value recognized in net income. The amended guidance became effective on January 1, 2018, and was applied on a modified retrospective basis. The adoption did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows as debt securities represent the majority of the Company's investment portfolio. Beginning January 1, 2018, publicly traded equity securities are presented within other assets on the consolidated balance sheet.Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash PaymentsIn August 2016, the FASB amended the guidance on the presentation and classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments in the consolidated statement of cash flows to eliminate current diversity in practice. The new guidance became effective on January 1, 2018, and the retrospective transition method has been applied to each period presented. Among other changes, the Company will classify debt extinguishment costs within cash flows from financing activities. E*TRADE Q1 2018 10-Q | Page 45  Table of ContentsE*TRADE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)Classification of Restricted CashIn November 2016, the FASB amended the guidance on the presentation and classification of changes in restricted cash in the consolidated statement of cash flows to eliminate current diversity in practice. The amended guidance requires the consolidated statement of cash flows to explain the change during the period in the total cash, cash equivalents, and amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents. The new guidance became effective on January 1, 2018 and has been applied using a retrospective transition method to each period presented. The Company concluded that cash required to be segregated under federal or other regulations is considered restricted cash and the segregated cash activity is now presented on the consolidated statement of cash flows.Clarifying the Definition of a BusinessIn January 2017, the FASB amended the guidance to clarify the definition of a business in order to assist companies in the evaluation of whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions or disposals of assets or businesses. The guidance, which became effective on January 1, 2018, did not change the Company's accounting conclusions for the TCA acquisition and is not expected to impact the Company's accounting conclusions for the acquisition of brokerage accounts from Capital One.Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging ActivitiesIn August 2017, the FASB amended the guidance to update the recognition and presentation of hedging relationships. Among other changes, the new guidance eases hedge documentation requirements and allows additional types of hedge accounting strategies. The Company early adopted this guidance beginning January 1, 2018. The Company applied the guidance on a modified retrospective basis, which resulted in a $7 million cumulative-effect adjustment to increase retained earnings and to decrease accumulated other comprehensive income. In addition, the guidance provided a one-time transition election to transfer certain debt securities from held-to-maturity to available-for-sale. The Company transferred agency mortgage-backed and agency debt securities with a fair value of $4.7 billion, and recognized a net pre-tax gain of $7 million within other comprehensive income. For additional information on the Company's adoption of the amended guidance, see Note 7—Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive IncomeIn February 2018, the FASB amended the guidance to address certain income tax effects in accumulated other comprehensive income resulting from the federal tax reform enacted in 2017. The amended guidance provides an option to reclassify tax effects within accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings in the period in which the effect of the tax reform is recorded. The amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods. Early adoption is permitted. The Company adopted the amended guidance in the first quarter of 2018 and recorded a $14 million increase to retained earnings and a corresponding decrease to accumulated other comprehensive income. Premium Amortization on Purchased Callable Debt SecuritiesIn March 2017, the FASB amended the guidance on the amortization period for certain callable debt securities held at a premium. The amended guidance shortens the amortization period for these securities by requiring the premium to be amortized to the earliest call date. The guidance does not amend the accounting for securities held at a discount. The Company early adopted this guidance beginning January 1, 2018; however, a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings was not required upon adoption as the Company did not hold any callable debt securities at a premium as of January 1, 2018. E*TRADE Q1 2018 10-Q | Page 46  Table of ContentsE*TRADE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)New Accounting Standards Not Yet AdoptedAccounting for LeasesIn February 2016, the FASB amended the guidance on accounting for leases. The new standard requires lessees to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for the rights and obligations created by all qualifying leases with terms of more than twelve months. The recognition, measurement and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease by a lessee remains substantially unchanged and depends on classification as a finance or operating lease. The new standard also requires quantitative and qualitative disclosures that provide information about the amounts related to leasing arrangements recorded in the consolidated financial statements. The new guidance will be effective for interim and annual periods beginning on January 1, 2019, and is required to be applied on a modified retrospective basis to the earliest period presented, which includes practical expedient options in certain circumstances. The Company is in the process of evaluating the new accounting guidance, which includes the assessment of whether certain executory contracts contain embedded leases. The Company has 30 regional financial centers and 8 corporate locations which are leased. The right of use asset and corresponding lease liability for these leases will be recognized on the Company's balance sheet upon adoption. Accounting for Credit LossesIn June 2016, the FASB amended the accounting guidance on accounting for credit losses. The amended guidance requires measurement of all expected credit losses for financial instruments, including loans and debt securities, and other commitments to extend credit held at the reporting date. For financial assets measured at amortized cost, factors such as historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts will be used to estimate expected credit losses. The amended guidance will also change the manner in which credit losses are recognized on debt securities classified as available-for-sale. The new guidance will be effective for interim and annual periods beginning January 1, 2020. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the new accounting guidance on the Company's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The Company does not expect the amended accounting guidance to have as significant of an impact as it could have if the Company were originating or purchasing mortgage loans. The Company's evaluation contemplates the recent performance of the run-off legacy mortgage and consumer loan portfolio and the credit profile of the current investment securities portfolio; however, the impact of the new guidance will depend on the current and expected macroeconomic conditions and the nature and characteristics of financial assets held by the Company on the date of adoption.Simplifying the Test for Goodwill ImpairmentIn January 2017, the FASB amended the guidance to simplify the test for goodwill impairment by eliminating Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. The amended guidance requires the Company to perform its annual goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. An impairment charge should be recognized at the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit; however, the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Income tax effects resulting from any tax deductible goodwill should be considered when measuring the goodwill impairment loss, if applicable. The Company will still have the option to perform a qualitative assessment to conclude whether it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of the Company exceeds its fair value. The guidance will be effective for interim and annual periods beginning January 1, 2020, and must be applied prospectively. Early adoption is permitted.

The transaction price in a contract is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and is recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied.Commissions RevenueCommissions are derived from the Company's customers and are impacted by DARTs, average commission per trade and the number of trading days. Commission rates differ by trade type (e.g., equities, derivatives, stock plan and mutual funds) and are also impacted by lower pricing for customers that qualify for active trader pricing. For certain trade types, such as options contracts, the total commission earned varies based on contract volume. Commissions from securities transactions are recognized on a trade-date basis. Order Flow RevenueOrder flow revenue is generated from market centers that accept trade orders from customer securities transactions. Order flow revenue is recognized on a trade-date basis when the Company has satisfied its performance obligation to the market center. Money Market Funds and Sweep Deposits RevenueMoney market funds and sweep deposits revenue is driven by fees earned from off-balance sheet customer cash. This revenue is typically based on the average daily balance and the federal funds rate or LIBOR plus a negotiated spread. E*TRADE Q1 2018 10-Q | Page 49  Table of ContentsE*TRADE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)OtherRevenue is recognized on other components of fees and service charges when or as the performance obligations are satisfied. Mutual fund service fees are asset-based fees that are driven by the amount of customer assets invested in each fund. Advisor management fees are generally earned based on a percentage of customer assets under management.Fees from software and services for managing equity compensation plans are recognized as the performance obligations are satisfied and are presented within other revenue on the consolidated statement of income. NOTE 3—FAIR VALUE DISCLOSURESFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In determining fair value, the Company may use various valuation approaches, including market, income and/or cost approaches. The fair value hierarchy requires the Company to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Fair value is a market-based measure considered from the perspective of a market participant. Accordingly, even when market assumptions are not readily available, the Company’s own assumptions reflect those that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. The fair value measurement accounting guidance describes the following three levels used to classify fair value measurements:•Level 1 - unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that are accessible by the Company•Level 2 - quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in an active market, quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly•Level 3 - unobservable inputs that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilitiesThe availability of observable inputs can vary and in certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, the level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The Company’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to a fair value measurement requires judgment and consideration of factors specific to the asset or liability.E*TRADE Q1 2018 10-Q | Page 50  Table of ContentsE*TRADE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)Recurring Fair Value Measurement TechniquesMortgage-backed SecuritiesThe Company’s mortgage-backed securities portfolio is comprised of agency mortgage-backed securities which are guaranteed by US government sponsored enterprises and federal agencies. The fair value of agency mortgage-backed securities was determined using a market approach with quoted market prices, recent transactions and spread data for identical or similar instruments. Agency mortgage-backed securities were categorized in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.Other Debt SecuritiesThe Company's fair value level classification of US Treasuries is based on the original maturity dates of the securities and whether the securities are the most recent issuances of a given maturity. US Treasuries with original maturities less than one year are classified as Level 1. US Treasuries with original maturities greater than one year are classified as Level 1 if they represent the most recent issuance of a given maturity; otherwise, these securities are classified as Level 2.The fair value measurements of agency debentures and agency debt securities were determined using market and income approaches along with the Company’s own trading activities for identical or similar instruments and were categorized in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.All of the Company’s municipal bonds were rated investment grade at March 31, 2018. These securities were valued using a market approach with pricing service valuations corroborated by recent market transactions for identical or similar bonds. Municipal bonds and corporate bonds were categorized in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Publicly Traded Equity SecuritiesThe fair value measurements of the Company's publicly traded equity securities were classified as Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy as they were based on quoted prices in active markets. Derivative InstrumentsInterest rate swaps were valued with an income approach using pricing models that are commonly used by the financial services industry. The market observable inputs used in the pricing models include the swap curve and overnight indexed swap basis from a financial data provider. The Company does not consider these models to involve significant judgment on the part of management, and the Company corroborated the fair value measurements with counterparty valuations. The Company’s derivative instruments were categorized in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The consideration of credit risk, the Company’s or the counterparty’s, did not result in an adjustment to the valuation of its derivative instruments in the periods presented. Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurement TechniquesCertain other assets are recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis: 1) one- to four-family and home equity loans in which the amount of the loan balance in excess of the estimated current value of the underlying property less estimated selling costs has been charged-off; and 2) real estate owned that is carried at the lower of the property’s carrying value or fair value less estimated selling costs.E*TRADE Q1 2018 10-Q | Page 51  Table of ContentsE*TRADE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)The Company evaluates and reviews assets that have been subject to fair value measurement requirements on a quarterly basis in accordance with policies and procedures that were designed to be in compliance with guidance from the Company’s regulators. These policies and procedures govern the frequency of the review, the use of acceptable valuation methods, and the consideration of estimated selling costs.Loans ReceivableLoans that have been delinquent for 180 days or that are in bankruptcy and certain TDR loan modifications are charged-off based on the estimated current value of the underlying property less estimated selling costs. Property valuations for these one- to four-family and home equity loans are based on the most recent "as is" property valuation data available, which may include appraisals, broker price opinions, automated valuation models or updated values using home price indices. These property valuations are updated on a monthly, quarterly or semi-annual basis depending on the type of valuation initially used. If the valuation data obtained is significantly different from the valuation previously received, the Company reviews additional property valuation data to corroborate or update the valuation. If the value of the underlying property has declined, an additional charge-off is recorded. If the value of the underlying property has increased, previously charged-off amounts are not reversed. Recoveries of previously charged-off amounts are recognized within the allowance for loan losses when received.Real Estate OwnedProperty valuations for real estate owned are based on the lowest value of the most recent property valuation data available, which may include appraisals, listing prices or approved offer prices.Nonrecurring fair value measurements on one- to four-family loans, home equity loans and real estate owned were classified as Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy as the valuations included unobservable inputs that were significant to the fair value. The following table presents additional information about significant unobservable inputs used in the valuation of assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis that were categorized in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy: Unobservable Inputs Average RangeMarch 31, 2018     Loans receivable:     One- to four-familyAppraised value $714,300 $250,000 - $1,750,000Home equityAppraised value $274,400 $65,000 - $550,000Real estate ownedAppraised value $280,300 $31,500 - $750,000      December 31, 2017     Loans receivable:     One- to four-familyAppraised value $520,700 $60,000 - $1,200,000Home equityAppraised value $317,300 $38,000 - $2,066,000Real estate ownedAppraised value $355,200 $4,500 - $2,000,000 E*TRADE Q1 2018 10-Q | Page 52  Table of ContentsE*TRADE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)Recurring and Nonrecurring Fair Value MeasurementsThe following table presents the significant components of assets and liabilities measured at fair value (dollars in millions): Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 TotalFair ValueMarch 31, 2018:       Recurring fair value measurements:       Assets       Available-for-sale securities:       Agency mortgage-backed securities$— $23,418 $— $23,418Agency debentures— 869 — 869US Treasuries— 439 — 439Agency debt securities— 90 — 90Municipal bonds— 19 — 19Total available-for-sale securities— 24,835 — 24,835Other assets:       Derivative assets(1)— 4 — 4Publicly traded equity securities(2)7 — — 7Total assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis(3)$7 $24,839 $— $24,846Nonrecurring fair value measurements:       Loans receivable, net:       One- to four-family$— $— $10 $10Home equity— — 2 2Total loans receivable— — 12 12Other assets:       Real estate owned— — 13 13Total assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis(4)$— $— $25 $25 (1)All derivative assets and liabilities were interest rate contracts at March 31, 2018.

Assumptions for expected losses, prepayments, cash flows and discount rates are adjusted to reflect the individual characteristics of the loans, such as credit risk, coupon, lien position, and payment characteristics, as well as the secondary market conditions for these types of loans.Although the market for one- to four-family and home equity loan portfolios has improved, given the lack of observability of valuation inputs, these fair value measurements cannot be determined with precision and changes in the underlying assumptions used, including discount rates, could significantly affect the results of current or future fair value estimates. In addition, the amount that would be realized in a forced liquidation, an actual sale or immediate settlement could be lower than both the carrying value and the estimated fair value of the portfolio.Deposits—Fair value of certificates of deposit is estimated using a discounted cash flow model. For the remainder of deposits, fair value is the amount payable on demand at the reporting date.FHLB advances—Fair value for FHLB advances was determined by discounting future cash flows using discount factors derived from current observable rates implied for other similar instruments with similar remaining maturities.Trust preferred securities—Fair value is estimated by discounting future cash flows at the yield implied by dealer pricing quotes.Corporate debt—Fair value is estimated using dealer pricing quotes.Fair Value of Commitments and ContingenciesIn the normal course of business, the Company makes various commitments to extend credit and incur contingent liabilities that are not reflected in the consolidated balance sheet. Changes in the economy or interest rates may influence the impact that these commitments and contingencies have on the Company in the future. The Company does not estimate the fair value of those commitments. Information related to such commitments and contingent liabilities is included in Note 14—Commitments, Contingencies and Other Regulatory Matters.E*TRADE Q1 2018 10-Q | Page 58  Table of ContentsE*TRADE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)NOTE 4—OFFSETTING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES For financial statement purposes, the Company does not offset derivative instruments or securities borrowing and securities lending transactions. These activities are generally transacted under master agreements that are widely used by counterparties and that may allow for net settlements of payments in the normal course, as well as offsetting of all contracts with a given counterparty in the event of bankruptcy or default of one of the two parties to the transaction. The following table presents information about the Company's derivative instruments, securities borrowing and securities lending transactions which are transacted under master agreements to enable the users of the Company’s consolidated financial statements to evaluate the potential effect of rights of set-off between these recognized assets and liabilities (dollars in millions):          Gross Amounts Not Offset in the Consolidated Balance Sheet      Gross Amounts of Recognized Assets and Liabilities Gross Amounts Offset in the Consolidated Balance Sheet Net Amounts Presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet (1) Financial Instruments Collateral Received or Pledged (Including Cash) Net AmountMarch 31, 2018            Assets:             Deposits paid for securities borrowed (2)$215 $— $215 $(174) $(31) $10  Derivative assets(3)4 — 4 — (2) 2   Total$219 $— $219 $(174) $(33) $12                Liabilities:             Deposits received for securities loaned (4)$2,840 $— $2,840 $(174) $(2,531) $135   Total$2,840 $— $2,840 $(174) $(2,531) $135               December 31, 2017            Assets:             Deposits paid for securities borrowed (2)$759 $— $759 $(251) $(483) $25   Total$759 $— $759 $(251) $(483) $25                Liabilities:             Deposits received for securities loaned (4)$1,373 $— $1,373 $(251) $(1,004) $118  Derivative liabilities (5)(6)5 — 5 — (5) —   Total$1,378 $— $1,378 $(251) $(1,009) $118(1)The vast majority of the net amount of deposits paid for securities borrowed are reflected in the receivables from brokers, dealers and clearing organizations line item while the deposits paid for securities borrowed under the fully paid program are reflected in other assets. Derivative assets are reflected in the other assets line item in the consolidated balance sheet. Net amount of deposits received for securities loaned are reflected in the payables to brokers, dealers and clearing organizations line item in the consolidated balance sheet.

For presentation purposes, these amounts presented are based on the counterparties under the Company’s master securities loan agreements.(3)Collateral received included cash at March 31, 2018.(4)Included in the gross amounts of deposits received for securities loaned was $2 billion and $821 million at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively, transacted through a program with a clearing organization, which guarantees the return of securities to the Company. For presentation purposes, these amounts presented are based on the counterparties under the Company’s master securities loan agreements.(5)Excludes net accrued interest payable of $2 million at December 31, 2017.(6)Collateral pledged included held-to-maturity securities at amortized cost at December 31, 2017.Securities Lending TransactionsDeposits paid for securities borrowed and deposits received for securities loaned are recorded at the amount of cash collateral advanced or received. Securities borrowing transactions require the Company to deposit cash with the lender whereas securities lending transactions result in the Company receiving collateral in the form of cash, with both requiring cash in an amount generally in excess of the market value of the securities. These transactions have overnight or continuous remaining contractual maturities. Securities lending transactions expose the Company to counterparty credit risk and market risk. To manage the counterparty risk, the Company maintains internal standards for approving counterparties, reviews and analyzes the credit rating of each counterparty, and monitors its positions with each counterparty on an ongoing basis. In addition, for certain of the Company's securities lending transactions, the Company uses a program with a clearing organization that guarantees the return of securities. The Company monitors the market value of the securities borrowed and loaned using collateral arrangements that require additional collateral to be obtained from or excess collateral to be returned to the counterparties based on changes in market value, to maintain specified collateral levels.Derivative TransactionsCertain types of derivatives that the Company utilizes in its hedging activities are subject to derivatives clearing agreements (cleared derivatives contracts). These cleared derivatives contracts enable clearing by a derivatives clearing organization through a clearing member. Under the contracts, the clearing member typically has a one-way right to offset all contracts in the event of the Company's default or bankruptcy. Collateral exchanged under these contracts is not included in the table above as the contracts may not qualify as master netting agreements. See Note 7—Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities for additional information.

At March 31, 2018, nearly 100% of these loans were amortizing. The home equity loan portfolio consists of HEILs and HELOCs. HEILs are primarily fully amortizing loans that do not offer the option of an interest-only payment.

Each derivative instrument is recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value as a freestanding asset or liability. The following table presents a summary of the fair value of derivatives as reported in the consolidated balance sheet (dollars in millions):    Fair Value Notional Asset(1) Liability(2) Net(3)March 31, 2018       Interest rate contracts:       Fair value hedges$10,086 $4 $— $4Total derivatives designated as hedging instruments(4)$10,086 $4 $— $4December 31, 2017       Interest rate contracts:       Fair value hedges$8,609 $131 $(14) $117Total derivatives designated as hedging instruments(4)$8,609 $131 $(14) $117 (1)Reflected in the other assets line item on the consolidated balance sheet.(2)Reflected in the other liabilities line item on the consolidated balance sheet.(3)Represents net fair value of derivative instruments for disclosure purposes only.(4)All derivatives were designated as hedging instruments at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017.In January 2017, one of the two central clearing organizations through which the Company executes certain of its derivative contracts amended its rulebooks to legally characterize variation margin payments as settlements of the derivatives' exposure rather than collateral against the exposure. In January 2018, the other central clearing organization made similar rulebook amendments. For these contracts, amounts exchanged with counterparties are reflected as a reduction of the related derivative assets or liabilities, including accrued interest, on the consolidated balance sheet. Accordingly, the consolidated balance sheet and the table above exclude derivative assets of $381 million and $6 million at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively, and derivative liabilities of $13 million and $18 million at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively, that were executed through a central clearing organization and were settled by variation margin payments. The Company therefore had no centrally cleared derivative contract assets or liabilities reflected on the consolidated balance sheet as a result of the rulebook changes as of March 31, 2018. At December 31, 2017, the Company had $131 million and $9 million of centrally cleared derivative contract assets and liabilities, respectively, reflected on the consolidated balance sheet.E*TRADE Q1 2018 10-Q | Page 73  Table of ContentsE*TRADE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)Fair Value HedgesThe Company utilizes fair value hedges to offset exposure to changes in value of certain fixed-rate assets. All of the Company's derivative instruments were designated in fair value hedging relationships at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017. For each fair value hedge, both the gain or loss on the derivative, including periodic cash settlement accruals, as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings. Hedge accounting is discontinued for fair value hedges if a derivative instrument is sold, terminated or otherwise de-designated. If fair value hedge accounting is discontinued, the previously hedged item is no longer adjusted for changes in fair value through the consolidated statement of income and the cumulative net gain or loss on the hedged item is amortized to net interest income using the effective interest method over the expected remaining life of the hedged item. Beginning January 1, 2018, the net earnings impact of a fair hedge that is not perfectly effective is recognized in the interest income line item in the consolidated statement of income. Prior to January 1, 2018, the net earnings impact due to changes in fair value of the derivative and the hedged item, which was previously referred to as ineffectiveness, is reflected in the gains on securities and other, net line item in the consolidated statement of income. The earnings impact of periodic cash settlements accruals on the derivative is reflected in the interest income line item in the consolidated statement of income. The following table presents the effects of fair value hedge accounting on the consolidated statement of income for the three months ended March 31, 2018 (dollars in millions): Interest IncomeTotal interest income$468  Effects of fair value hedging on total interest income(1) Agency debentures: Amounts recognized as interest settlements on derivatives(2)Changes in fair value of hedged items(50)Changes in fair value of derivatives 49Net loss on fair value hedging relationships - agency debentures(3)  Agency mortgage backed securities: Amounts recognized as interest settlements on derivatives(13)Amortization of basis adjustments from discontinued hedges2Changes in fair value of hedged items(231)Changes in fair value of derivatives229Net loss on fair value hedging relationships - agency mortgage backed securities(13)Total net loss on fair value hedging relationships$(16)(1)Excludes interest income accruals on hedged items and amounts recognized upon the sale of securities attributable to fair value hedge accounting.

The minimum net capital requirements can be met under either the Aggregate Indebtedness method or the Alternative method. Under the Aggregate Indebtedness method, a broker-dealer is required to maintain minimum net capital of the greater of 6 2/3% of its aggregate indebtedness, as defined, or a minimum dollar amount. E*TRADE Securities has elected the Alternative method, under which it is required to maintain net capital equal to the greater of $250,000 or 2% of aggregate debit balances arising from customer transactions. The Company’s international broker-dealer subsidiary is subject to capital requirements determined by its respective regulator.The Company's FCM, E*TRADE Futures, is subject to CFTC net capital requirements, including the maintenance of adjusted net capital equal to or in excess of the greater of (1) $1,000,000, (2) the FCM's risk-based capital requirement, computed as 8% of the total risk margin requirements for all positions carried in customer and non-customer accounts, or (3) the amount of adjusted net capital required by the NFA.E*TRADE Q1 2018 10-Q | Page 80  Table of ContentsE*TRADE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)At March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, all of the Company’s broker-dealer and FCM subsidiaries met minimum net capital requirements.

Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can trigger certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the financial condition and results of operations of these entities. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, these entities must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. In addition, the Company's bank subsidiaries may not pay dividends to the parent company without the non-objection, or in certain cases the approval, of their regulators, and any loans by the bank subsidiaries to the parent company and its other non-bank subsidiaries are subject to various quantitative, arm’s length, collateralization and other requirements. The capital amounts and classifications of these entities are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors.E*TRADE Q1 2018 10-Q | Page 81  Table of ContentsE*TRADE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require these entities to meet minimum Tier 1 leverage, common equity Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 risk-based capital and total risk-based capital ratios. Events beyond management's control, such as deterioration in credit markets, could adversely affect future earnings and their ability to meet future capital requirements.

The Company establishes an accrual for losses at management's best estimate when it assesses that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company monitors these matters for developments that would affect the likelihood of a loss and the accrued amount, if any, and adjusts the amount as appropriate.Litigation MattersOn October 27, 2000, Ajaxo, Inc. (Ajaxo) filed a complaint in the Superior Court for the State of California, County of Santa Clara. Ajaxo sought damages and certain non-monetary relief for the Company’s alleged breach of a non-disclosure agreement with Ajaxo pertaining to certain wireless technology that Ajaxo offered the Company as well as damages and other relief against the Company for their alleged misappropriation of Ajaxo’s trade secrets. Following a jury trial, a judgment was entered in 2003 in favor of Ajaxo against the Company for $1 million for breach of the Ajaxo non-disclosure agreement. The trial court subsequently denied Ajaxo’s requests for additional damages and relief following which Ajaxo appealed. Although the Company paid Ajaxo the full amount due on the above-described judgment, the case was remanded back to the trial court by the California Court of Appeal, and on May 30, 2008, a jury returned a verdict in favor of the Company denying all claims raised and demands for damages against the Company. After various appeals the case was again remanded back to the trial court. Following the third trial in this matter, in a Judgment and Statement of Decision filed September 16, 2015, the Court denied all claims for royalties by Ajaxo. Ajaxo’s post-trial motions were denied. Ajaxo has appealed to the Court of Appeal, Sixth District. The Company will continue to defend itself vigorously in this matter.On May 16, 2011, Droplets Inc., the holder of two patents pertaining to user interface servers, filed a complaint in the US District Court for the Eastern District of Texas against E*TRADE Financial Corporation, E*TRADE Securities, E*TRADE Bank and multiple other unaffiliated financial services firms. The plaintiff contends that the defendants engaged in patent infringement under federal law and seeks unspecified damages and an injunction against future infringements, plus royalties, costs, interest and attorneys’ fees. On March 28, 2012, a change of venue was granted and the case was transferred to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The Company's motion for summary judgment on the grounds of non-infringement was granted by the US District Court in a Decision and Order dated March 9, 2015. All remaining claims are stayed pending resolution of issues on Droplet's remaining patents under review by the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB). After a hearing, the PTAB deemed Droplets’ putative '115 patent to be “unpatentable” on June 23, 2016. In a separate proceeding, the PTAB has also separately deemed Droplets’ putative '838 patent to be “unpatentable.” Droplets appealed to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. The decision of the PTAB was affirmed on April 19, 2018. The Company will continue to defend itself vigorously in this matter.On March 26, 2015, a putative class action was filed in the US District Court for the Northern District of California by Ty Rayner, on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated, naming E*TRADE Financial Corporation and E*TRADE Securities as defendants. The complaint alleges that E*TRADE breached a fiduciary duty and unjustly enriched itself in connection with the routing of its customers’ orders to various market-makers and exchanges. The plaintiff seeks unspecified damages, declaratory relief, restitution, disgorgement of payments received by the Company, and attorneys’ fees. On April 2, 2017, the District Court dismissed the complaint in Rayner. The plaintiffs in Rayner appealed and the oral argument was E*TRADE Q1 2018 10-Q | Page 83  Table of ContentsE*TRADE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)heard by the Second Court of Appeals on December 7, 2017. The Company will continue to defend itself vigorously in these matters.On July 23, 2016, a putative class action was filed in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York by Craig L. Schwab, on behalf of himself and others similarly situated, naming E*TRADE Financial Corporation, E*TRADE Securities, and former Company executives as defendants. The complaint alleges that E*TRADE violated federal securities laws in connection with the routing of its customers’ orders to various market-makers and exchanges. The plaintiff seeks unspecified damages, declaratory relief, restitution, disgorgement of payments received by the Company, and attorneys’ fees. By stipulation both matters are now venued in the Southern District of New York. On July 10, 2017 the Court dismissed the Schwab claims without prejudice. The plaintiff in Schwab filed a third amended complaint on August 9, 2017, which E*TRADE moved to dismiss. On January 22, 2018, the Court dismissed all claims with prejudice. Plaintiffs have appealed. The Company will continue to defend itself vigorously in these matters.In addition to the matters described above, the Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the normal course of business. In each pending matter, the Company contests liability or the amount of claimed damages. In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of such matters, particularly in cases where claimants seek substantial or indeterminate damages, or where investigation or discovery have yet to be completed, the Company is unable to estimate a range of reasonably possible losses on its remaining outstanding legal proceedings; however, the Company believes any losses, both individually or in the aggregate, would not be reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition or results of operations of the Company.An unfavorable outcome in any matter could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, even if the ultimate outcomes are resolved in the Company’s favor, the defense of such litigation could entail considerable cost or the diversion of the efforts of management, either of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.Regulatory MattersThe securities, futures, foreign currency and banking industries are subject to extensive regulation under federal, state and applicable international laws. From time to time, the Company has been threatened with or named as a defendant in lawsuits, arbitrations and administrative claims involving securities, banking and other matters. The Company is also subject to periodic regulatory examinations and inspections. Compliance and trading problems that are reported to regulators, such as the SEC, FINRA, NASDAQ, CFTC, NFA, FDIC, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, OCC, or the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau by dissatisfied customers or others are investigated by such regulators, and may, if pursued, result in formal claims being filed against the Company by customers or disciplinary action being taken against the Company or its employees by regulators. Any such claims or disciplinary actions that are decided against the Company could have a material impact on the financial results of the Company or any of its subsidiaries.InsuranceThe Company maintains insurance coverage that management believes is reasonable and prudent. The principal insurance coverage it maintains covers commercial general liability; property damage; hardware/software damage; cyber liability; directors and officers; employment practices liability; certain criminal acts against the Company; and errors and omissions. The Company believes that such insurance coverage is adequate for the purpose of its business. The Company’s ability to maintain this level of insurance coverage E*TRADE Q1 2018 10-Q | Page 84  Table of ContentsE*TRADE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)in the future, however, is subject to the availability of affordable insurance in the marketplace.CommitmentsIn the normal course of business, the Company makes various commitments to extend credit and incur contingent liabilities that are not reflected in the consolidated balance sheet. Significant changes in the economy or interest rates may influence the impact that these commitments and contingencies have on the Company in the future.The Company’s equity method, cost method and other investments are generally limited liability investments in partnerships, companies and other similar entities, including tax credit partnerships and community development entities, which are not required to be consolidated. The Company had $95 million in unfunded commitments with respect to these investments at March 31, 2018.At March 31, 2018, the Company had $19 million of certificates of deposit scheduled to mature in less than one year.GuaranteesIn prior periods when the Company sold loans, the Company provided guarantees to investors purchasing mortgage loans, which are considered standard representations and warranties within the mortgage industry. The primary guarantees are that: the mortgage and the mortgage note have been duly executed and each is the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable in accordance with its terms; the mortgage has been duly acknowledged and recorded and is valid; and the mortgage and the mortgage note are not subject to any right of rescission, set-off, counterclaim or defense, including, without limitation, the defense of usury, and no such right of rescission, set-off, counterclaim or defense has been asserted with respect thereto. The Company is responsible for the guarantees on loans sold. If these claims prove to be untrue, the investor can require the Company to repurchase the loan and return all loan purchase and servicing release premiums. Management does not believe the potential liability exposure will have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows or financial condition due to the nature of the standard representations and warranties, which have resulted in a minimal amount of loan repurchases.Prior to 2008, ETBH raised capital through the formation of trusts, which sold TRUPs in the capital markets. The capital securities must be redeemed in whole at the due date, which is generally 30 years after issuance. Each trust issued TRUPs at par, with a liquidation amount of $1,000 per capital security. The trusts used the proceeds from the sale of issuances to purchase subordinated debentures issued by ETBH.During the 30-year period prior to the redemption of the TRUPs, ETBH guarantees the accrued and unpaid distributions on these securities, as well as the redemption price of the securities and certain costs that may be incurred in liquidating, terminating or dissolving the trusts (all of which would otherwise be payable by the trusts). At March 31, 2018, management estimated that the maximum potential liability under this arrangement, including the current carrying value of the trusts, was equal to $416 million or the total face value of these securities plus accrued interest payable, which may be unpaid at the termination of the trust arrangement.E*TRADE Q1 2018 10-Q | Page 85  Table of ContentsE*TRADE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)NOTE 15—SUBSEQUENT EVENTAcquisition of Trust Company of AmericaOn April 9, 2018, the Company completed its previously announced acquisition of TCA for total consideration of $275 million in cash. TCA is a leading provider of technology solutions and custody services to the independent RIA market. The acquisition is expected to benefit the Company as the RIA portion of our industry is growing and the Company expects to leverage the E*TRADE brand to accelerate growth. The Company also expects this acquisition to help bolster the Company's ability to retain customers in need of specialized customer service engagement. The operating results of the Company for the three months ended March 31, 2018 do not include the operating results related to TCA as the acquisition did not close until April 9, 2018. The initial accounting for the TCA acquisition has not been completed as of issuance date of these financial statements because the fair value measurement of assets acquired, liabilities assumed and goodwill has not yet been finalized. The Company expects to finalize the valuation and complete the purchase price allocation as soon as practicable but no later than one year from the acquisition date.E*TRADE Q1 2018 10-Q | Page 86  Table of Contents ITEM 4.
