Item 1A. Risk Factors.  Credit Risk Management  Our primary sources of credit risk are our loan and securities portfolios, where risk results from extending credit to customers and purchasing securities, respectively. The degree of credit risk associated with our loans and securities varies based on many factors including the size of the transaction, the credit characteristics of the borrower, features of the loan product or security, the contractual terms of the related documents and the availability and quality of collateral. Credit risk is one of the most common risks in financial services and is one of our most significant risks.  Credit risk is monitored by our Credit Risk Committee. The Credit Risk Committee uses detailed tracking and analysis to measure credit performance and reviews and modifies credit policies as appropriate.  Loss Mitigation  Given the deterioration in the performance of our loan portfolio, particularly in our home equity loan portfolio, we formed a special credit management team in early 2008 to focus on the mitigation of potential losses in the home equity loan portfolio.  This team’s initial focus was to reduce our exposure to open home equity lines. Through a variety of strategies, including voluntary line closures, automatically freezing lines on all delinquent accounts, and freezing lines on loans with materially reduced home equity, we have reduced this amount from a high of over $7 billion in 2007 to $1.7 billion as of June 30, 2009.  We also initiated a loan modification program in 2008 that in its early stages, resulted in an insignificant number of minor modifications. This loan modification program became more active during the first half of 2009. We consider modifications in which we made an economic concession to a borrower experiencing     30    Table of Contents  financial difficulty a troubled debt restructuring (“TDR”). As of June 30, 2009, we had modified $272.0 million of loans in which the modification was considered a TDR. We also modified a number of loans through traditional collections actions taken in the normal course of servicing delinquent accounts. These actions typically result in an insignificant delay in the timing of payments; therefore, the Company does not consider such activities to be economic concessions to the borrowers. On February 18, 2009, the U.S. Department of the Treasury announced the Homeowner Affordability and Stability Plan. The primary focus of this plan is to create requirements and provide incentives to modify mortgages with the goal of avoiding foreclosure. We believe our loan modification program goals are in line with the Homeowner Affordability and Stability Plan and we have aligned our servicer guidelines with the government’s program. Our loan modification programs target borrowers who demonstrate a willingness and ability to meet their loan obligations and stay in their homes. To date our programs have focused on modifications to the rate and term of loans, which often results in a lower monthly payment for the borrower.  The team has several other initiatives either in progress or in development which are focused on mitigating losses in our home equity loan portfolio. Those initiatives include improving collection efforts and practices of our servicers as well as increasing our loss recovery efforts to minimize the level of loss on a loan that goes to charge-off.  In addition, we continue to review our mortgage loan portfolio in order to identify loans to be repurchased by the originator. Our review is primarily focused on identifying loans with violations of transaction representations and warranties or material misrepresentation on the part of the seller. Any loans identified with these deficiencies are submitted to the original seller for repurchase. For the six months ended June 30, 2009, approximately $44.3 million of loans, and for the year ended December 31, 2008, approximately $105.6 million of loans were repurchased by the original sellers.  Underwriting Standards—Originated Loans  During the second quarter of 2008, we exited our retail mortgage origination business, which represented our last remaining loan origination channel. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2008, we originated approximately $42 million and $158 million, respectively, in one- to four-family loans through our retail mortgage origination business. These loans were predominantly prime credit quality first-lien mortgage loans secured by a single-family residence. In March 2009, we partnered with a third party company to provide access to real estate loans for our customers. This product is being offered as a convenience to our customers and is not one of our primary product offerings. We structured this arrangement to minimize our assumption of any of the typical risks commonly associated with mortgage lending. The third party company providing this product performs all processing and underwriting of these loans. Shortly after closing, the third party company purchases the loans from us and is responsible for the credit risk associated with these loans. We originated $30.5 million in loans during the six months ended June 30, 2009 and we had commitments to originate mortgage loans of $47.4 million at June 30, 2009.  CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK  Loans  We track and review many factors to predict and monitor credit risk in our loan portfolios, which are primarily made up of loans secured by residential real estate. These factors, which are documented at the time of origination, include: borrowers’ debt-to-income ratio, borrowers’ credit scores, housing prices, documentation type, occupancy type, and loan type. We also review estimated current loan-to-value (“LTV”) ratios when monitoring credit risk in our loan portfolios. In economic conditions in which housing prices generally appreciate, we believe that loan type, LTV ratios and credit scores are the key factors in determining future loan performance. In the current housing market with declining home prices and less credit available for refinance, we believe the LTV ratio becomes a more important factor in predicting and monitoring credit risk.    31    Table of Contents We believe certain categories of loans inherently have a higher level of credit risk due to characteristics of the borrower and/or features of the loan. Two of these categories are sub-prime and option ARM loans. As a general matter, we did not originate or purchase these loans to hold on our balance sheet; however, in the normal course of purchasing large pools of real estate loans, we invariably ended up acquiring a de minimis amount of sub-prime loans. As of June 30, 2009, sub-prime(1) real estate loans represented less than one-fifth of one percent of our total real estate loan portfolio and we held no option ARM loans.  As noted above, we believe loan type, LTV ratios and borrowers’ credit scores are key determinants of future loan performance. Our home equity loan portfolio is primarily second lien loans(2) on residential real estate properties, which have a higher level of credit risk than first lien mortgage loans. We believe home equity loans with a combined loan-to-value (“CLTV”) of 90% or higher or a Fair Isaac Credit Organization (“FICO”) score below 700 are the loans with the highest levels of credit risk in our portfolios.  The breakdowns by LTV/CLTV and FICO score of our two main loan portfolios, one-to four-family and home equity, are as follows (dollars in thousands):                            One- to Four-Family     Home Equity     LTV/CLTV at Origination(3)   June 30,2009     December 31,2008     June 30,2009     December 31,2008     <=70%   $ 5,167,985     $ 5,647,650     $ 2,883,171     $ 3,126,274     70% - 80%     6,388,782       7,008,860       1,658,960       1,822,797     80% - 90%     207,398       162,966       2,947,945       3,312,332     >90%     136,607       160,368       1,492,619       1,755,780                                       Total   $ 11,900,772     $ 12,979,844     $ 8,982,695     $ 10,017,183                                       Average LTV/CLTV at loan origination(4)     70.4 %      68.8 %      78.7 %      79.1 %    Average estimated current LTV/CLTV(5)     94.6 %      90.1 %      102.4 %      99.7 %           One- to Four-Family     Home Equity     FICO at Origination   June 30,2009     December 31,2008     June 30,2009     December 31,2008     >=720   $ 7,885,126     $ 8,680,892     $ 5,422,748     $ 6,005,837     719 - 700     1,625,634       1,750,294       1,424,393       1,591,380     699 - 680     1,260,591       1,342,967       1,220,602       1,379,218     679 - 660     733,013       784,449       524,586       595,776     659 - 620     387,687       412,514       379,263       432,862     <620     8,721       8,728       11,103       12,110                                       Total   $ 11,900,772     $ 12,979,844     $ 8,982,695     $ 10,017,183                                          (1)   Defined as borrowers with FICO scores less than 620 at the time of origination.    (2)   Approximately 14% of the home equity portfolio is in the first lien position. For home equity loans that are in a second lien position, we also hold the first lien position on the same residential real estate property for less than 1% of the loans in this portfolio.    (3)   CLTV at origination calculations for home equity are based on drawn balances.    (4)   Average LTV/CLTV at loan origination calculations are based on LTV/CLTV at time of purchase for one- to four-family purchased loans and undrawn balances for home equity loans.    (5)   The average estimated current LTV ratio reflects the outstanding balance at the balance sheet date, divided by the estimated current property value. Current property values are estimated using the most recent property value data available to us. For properties in which we did not have an updated valuation, we utilized home price indices to estimate the current property value.    32    Table of Contents In addition to the factors described above, we monitor credit trends in loans by acquisition channel and vintage, which are summarized below as of June 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008 (dollars in thousands):                        One- to Four-Family   Home Equity   Acquisition Channel   June 30,2009   December 31,2008   June 30,2009   December 31,2008   Purchased from a third party   $ 9,740,846   $ 10,646,324   $ 7,930,747   $ 8,873,156   Originated by the Company     2,159,926     2,333,520     1,051,948     1,144,027                             Total real estate loans   $ 11,900,772   $ 12,979,844   $ 8,982,695   $ 10,017,183                                    One- to Four-Family   Home Equity   Vintage Year   June 30,2009   December 31,2008   June 30,2009   December 31,2008   2003 and prior   $ 503,767   $ 577,408   $ 682,798   $ 754,054   2004     1,166,163     1,309,985     915,386     990,138   2005     2,477,480     2,695,718     2,212,834     2,426,000   2006     4,483,074     4,890,407     4,102,050     4,668,721   2007     3,241,602     3,475,661     1,053,502     1,161,667   2008     28,686     30,665     16,125     16,603                             Total real estate loans   $ 11,900,772   $ 12,979,844   $ 8,982,695   $ 10,017,183                            Allowance for Loan Losses  The allowance for loan losses is management’s estimate of credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date. The estimate of the allowance for loan losses is based on a variety of factors, including the composition and quality of the portfolio; delinquency levels and trends; current and historical charge-off and loss experience; current industry charge-off and loss experience; the condition of the real estate market and geographic concentrations within the loan portfolio; the interest rate climate; the overall availability of housing credit; and general economic conditions. The allowance for loan losses is typically equal to management’s estimate of loan charge-offs in the twelve months following the balance sheet date and the estimated charge-offs, including the economic concession to the borrower, over the estimated remaining life of loans modified in a troubled debt restructuring. Determining the adequacy of the allowance is complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Subsequent evaluations of the loan portfolio, in light of the factors then prevailing, may result in significant changes in the allowance for loan losses in future periods. We believe our allowance for loan losses at June 30, 2009 is representative of probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date.  In determining the allowance for loan losses, we allocate a portion of the allowance to various loan products based on an analysis of individual loans and pools of loans. However, the entire allowance is available to absorb credit losses inherent in the total loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date.  The following table presents the allowance for loan losses by major loan category (dollars in thousands):                                    One- to Four-Family     Home Equity     Consumer and Other     Total        Allowance   Allowanceas a %of LoansReceivable(1)     Allowance   Allowanceas a % ofLoansReceivable(1)     Allowance   Allowanceas a % ofLoansReceivable(1)     Allowance   Allowanceas a %of LoansReceivable(1)     June 30, 2009   $ 428,017   3.58 %    $ 718,866   7.88 %    $ 72,056   3.46 %    $ 1,218,939   5.27 %    December 31, 2008   $ 185,163   1.42 %    $ 833,835   8.19 %    $ 61,613   2.65 %    $ 1,080,611   4.23 %       (1)    Allowance as a percentage of loans receivable is calculated based on the gross loans receivable for each respective category.    33    Table of Contents During the six months ended June 30, 2009, the allowance for loan losses increased by $138.3 million from the level at December 31, 2008. This increase was driven primarily by the increase in the allowance allocated to the one- to four-family loan portfolio, which began to deteriorate during 2008. However, the majority of the allowance as of June 30, 2009 related to the home equity portfolio, which began to deteriorate during the second half of 2007. We believe the deterioration in both of these portfolios was caused by several factors, including: home price depreciation in virtually all key markets; growing inventories of unsold homes; rising foreclosure rates; significant contraction in the availability of credit; and a general decline in economic growth. In addition, the combined impact of home price depreciation and the reduction of available credit made it increasingly difficult for borrowers to refinance existing loans. Although we expect our provision for loan losses to continue at historically high levels in future periods, the level of provision for loan losses in the second quarter of 2009 represents the third consecutive quarter in which the provision for loan losses has declined when compared to the prior quarter. While we cannot state with certainty that this trend will continue, we believe it is a positive indicator that our loan portfolio may be stabilizing. Included in our allowance for loan losses at June 30, 2009 was a specific allowance of $105.6 million that was established for TDRs. The specific allowance for these individually impaired loans represents the expected loss, including the economic concession to the borrower, over the remaining life of the loan.

Our policy for both one- to four-family and home equity loans is to assess the value of the property when the loan has been delinquent for 180 days or is in bankruptcy, regardless of whether or not the property is in foreclosure, and charge-off the amount of the loan balance in excess of the estimated current property value. Our policy is to charge-off credit cards when collection is not probable or the loan has been delinquent for 180 days and to charge-off closed-end consumer loans when the loan is 120 days delinquent or when we determine that collection is not probable.  Net charge-offs for the three and six months ended June 30, 2009 compared to the same periods in 2008 increased by $137.2 million and $294.9 million, respectively. The overall increase was primarily due to higher net charge-offs on our one- to four-family loans and home equity loans, which were driven mainly by the same factors as described above. We believe net charge-offs will begin to decline in future periods when compared to the level of charge-offs in the three months ended June 30, 2009 as a result of our decline in special mention delinquencies, which are discussed below. The following graph illustrates the net charge-offs by quarter:     Nonperforming Assets  We classify loans as nonperforming when they are 90 days past due. The following table shows the comparative data for nonperforming loans and assets (dollars in thousands):                    June 30,2009     December 31,2008     One- to four-family   $ 1,117,966     $ 593,075     Home equity     339,119       341,255     Consumer and other loans     16,567       7,792                       Total nonperforming loans     1,473,652       942,122     Real estate owned (“REO”) and other repossessed assets, net     75,661       108,105                       Total nonperforming assets, net   $ 1,549,313     $ 1,050,227                       Nonperforming loans receivable as a percentage of gross loans receivable     6.37 %      3.69 %    One- to four-family allowance for loan losses as a percentage of one- to four-family nonperforming loans     38.29 %      31.22 %    Home equity allowance for loan losses as a percentage of home equity nonperforming loans     211.98 %      244.34 %    Consumer and other allowance for loan losses as a percentage of consumer and other nonperforming loans     434.94 %      790.72 %    Total allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total nonperforming loans     82.72 %      114.70 %     35    Table of Contents During the six months ended June 30, 2009, our nonperforming assets, net increased $499.1 million to $1.5 billion compared to December 31, 2008. The increase was attributed primarily to an increase in nonperforming one- to four-family loans delinquent in excess of 180 days of $352.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2009 when compared to December 31, 2008. This increase was due primarily to a moratorium on foreclosures, which began in the fourth quarter of 2008. We resumed our normal foreclosure process during the second quarter of 2009.  The following graph illustrates the nonperforming loans by quarter:     The allowance as a percentage of total nonperforming loans receivable, net decreased from 115% at December 31, 2008 to 83% at June 30, 2009. This decrease was driven by an increase in one- to four-family nonperforming loans, which have a lower level of expected loss when compared to home equity loans. The balance of nonperforming loans includes loans delinquent 90 to 179 days as well as loans delinquent 180 days and greater. We believe the distinction between these two periods is important as loans delinquent 180 days and greater have been written down to their expected recovery value, whereas loans delinquent 90 to 179 days have not. We believe the allowance for loan losses expressed as a percentage of loans delinquent 90 to 179 days is an important measure of the adequacy of the allowance as these loans are expected to drive the vast majority of future charge-offs. Additional charge-offs on loans delinquent 180 days are possible if home prices decline beyond our current expectations, but we do not anticipate these charge-offs to be significant, particularly when compared to the expected charge-offs on loans delinquent 90 to 179 days. We consider this ratio especially important for one- to four-family loans as we expect the balances of loans delinquent 180 days and greater to increase in the future due to the extensive amount of time it takes to foreclose on a property in the current real estate market.  The following table shows the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans delinquent 90 to 179 days for each of our major loan categories (dollars in thousands):                  June 30,2009   Allowance as a % of LoansDelinquent 90 to 179 days     One- to four-family loans   $ 445,341   96.11 %    Home equity loans     261,943   274.44 %    Consumer and other loans     15,547   463.47 %                Total loans delinquent 90 to 179 days   $ 722,831   168.63 %                 36    Table of Contents In addition to nonperforming assets, we monitor loans where a borrower’s past credit history casts doubt on their ability to repay a loan (“special mention” loans). We classify loans as special mention when they are between 30 and 89 days past due. The following table shows the comparative data for special mention loans (dollars in thousands):                    June 30,2009     December 31,2008     One- to four-family   $ 563,050     $ 594,379     Home equity     268,086       407,386     Consumer and other loans     28,572       33,298                       Total special mention loans   $ 859,708     $ 1,035,063                       Special mention loans receivable as a percentage of gross loans receivable     3.71 %      4.05 %   The trend in special mention loan balances are generally indicative of the expected trend for charge-offs in future periods, as these loans have a greater propensity to migrate into nonaccrual status and ultimately charge-off. One- to four-family loans are generally secured in a first lien position by real estate assets, reducing the potential loss when compared to an unsecured loan. Our home equity loans are generally secured by real estate assets; however, the majority of these loans are secured in a second lien position, which substantially increases the potential loss when compared to a first lien position.  During the six months ended June 30, 2009, special mention loans decreased by $175.4 million to $859.7 million. This decrease was almost entirely due to a decrease in home equity special mention loans. The decrease in home equity special mention loans includes the impact of our loan modification programs in which borrowers who were 30 to 89 days past due were made current(1). While our level of special mention loans can fluctuate significantly in any given period, we believe the decrease we observed in the first half of 2009 is an encouraging sign regarding the future credit performance of this portfolio.  The following graph illustrates the special mention loans by quarter:         (1)   Loans modified as TDRs are accounted for as nonaccrual loans at the time of modification and return to accrual status after six consecutive payments are made in accordance with the modified terms.    37    Table of Contents Securities  We focus primarily on security type and credit rating to monitor credit risk in our securities portfolios. We believe our highest concentration of credit risk within this portfolio is the non-agency CMO portfolio.

As a result of the deterioration in the expected credit performance of the underlying loans in the securities, they were written down by recording a $29.7 million and $48.5 million net impairment during the three and six months ended June 30, 2009. Further declines in the performance of our non-agency CMO portfolio could result in additional impairments in future periods.  SUMMARY OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  The preparation of our financial condition and results of operations requires us to make judgments and estimates that may have a significant impact upon the financial results of the Company. We believe that of our significant accounting policies, the following require estimates and assumptions that require complex, subjective judgments by management, which can materially impact reported results: allowance for loan losses; fair value measurements; classification and valuation of certain investments; accounting for derivative instruments; estimates of effective tax rates, deferred taxes and valuation allowances; valuation of goodwill and other intangibles; and, valuation and expensing of share-based payments. These are more fully described in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed May 14, 2009. The following significant accounting policies have been updated for the period ended June 30, 2009:        •    Allowance for loan losses—During the first half of 2009, our loan modification program became more active resulting in $272.0 million of TDRs as of June 30, 2009. As a result, we updated our allowance for loan losses accounting policy to include our policy for TDRs.    38    Table of Contents     •    Classification and valuation of certain investments—On April 1, 2009, the Company adopted FSP No. FAS 115-2 and FAS 124-2, which amends the other-than-temporary accounting guidance for debt securities as well as the presentation of OTTI on the consolidated financial statements. As a result, we updated our classification and valuation of certain investments accounting policy to include our updated OTTI policy for impaired debt securities.  Allowance for Loan Losses  Description  The allowance for loan losses is management’s estimate of credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date. In determining the adequacy of the allowance, we perform periodic evaluations of the loan portfolio and loss forecasting assumptions. At June 30, 2009, our allowance for loan losses was $1.2 billion on $22.9 billion of loans designated as held-for-investment.  Judgments  The estimate of the allowance is based on a variety of factors, including the composition and quality of the portfolio; delinquency levels and trends; current and historical charge-off and loss experience; current industry charge-off and loss experience; the condition of the real estate market and geographic concentrations within the loan portfolio; the interest rate climate; the overall availability of housing credit; and general economic conditions. The allowance for loan losses is typically equal to management’s estimate of loan charge-offs in the twelve months following the balance sheet date and the estimated charge-offs, including the economic concession to the borrower, over the estimated remaining life of loans modified in a TDR. Determining the adequacy of the allowance is complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. We evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses by loan type: one- to four-family, home equity and consumer and other loan portfolios.  For loans that are not specifically identified for impairment under SFAS No. 114, Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan-an amendment of FASB Statements No. 5 and 15 (“SFAS No. 114”), our allowance is assessed in accordance with SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies (“SFAS No. 5”). Our one- to four-family and home equity loan portfolios are separated into risk segments based on key risk factors, which include but are not limited to channel of loan origination, documentation type, loan product type and LTV ratio. Based upon the segmentation, probable losses are determined with expected loss rates in each segment. The additional protection provided by mortgage insurance and the credit default swap has been factored into the expected loss on defaulted mortgage loans. The expected recovery from the liquidation of foreclosed real estate and expected recoveries from loan sellers related to contractual guarantees are also factored into the expected loss on defaulted mortgage loans. Our one- to four-family and home equity loan portfolios represented 52% and 39%, respectively, of the total gross loan portfolio as of June 30, 2009.  For the consumer and other loan portfolio, management establishes loss estimates for each consumer portfolio based on credit characteristics and observation of the existing markets. The expected recoveries from the sale of repossessed collateral are factored into the expected loss on defaulted consumer loans based on current liquidation experience. Our consumer and other loan portfolio represented 9% of the total gross loan portfolio as of June 30, 2009.  In addition to the SFAS No. 5 allowance, we also establish a specific allowance in accordance with SFAS No. 114 for loans modified as TDRs. Under SFAS No. 114, the impairment of a loan is measured using a discounted cash flow analysis. A specific allowance is established to the extent that the recorded investment exceeds the discounted cash flows of a TDR with a corresponding charge to the provision for loan losses. The specific allowance for these individually impaired loans represents the expected loss over the remaining life of the loan, including the economic concession to the borrower.    39    Table of Contents Subsequent evaluations of the loan portfolio, in light of the factors then prevailing, may result in significant changes in the allowance for loan losses in future periods.  Effects if Actual Results Differ  The crisis in the residential real estate and credit markets has substantially increased the complexity and uncertainty involved in estimating the losses inherent in our loan portfolio. If our underlying assumptions and judgments prove to be inaccurate, the allowance for loan losses could be insufficient to cover actual losses. These losses would result in a decrease in our net income as well as a decrease in the level of regulatory capital at E*TRADE Bank.  Classification and Valuation of Certain Investments  Description  We generally classify our investments in debt securities and marketable equity securities as either trading or available-for-sale. We have not classified any investments as held-to-maturity. The classification of an investment determines its accounting treatment. Both unrealized and realized gains and losses on trading securities held by our banking subsidiaries are recognized in gain on loans and securities, net. Securities held by our brokerage subsidiaries are for market-making purposes and gains and losses are recorded as principal transactions revenue. Available-for-sale securities consist primarily of debt securities, specifically residential mortgage-backed securities, as of June 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008. Securities classified as available-for-sale are carried at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities included in accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax.  Declines in fair value for available-for-sale debt securities that we believe to be other-than-temporary are included in the net impairment line item. Beginning in the second quarter of 2009, our OTTI evaluation for available-for-sale debt securities reflects the adoption of FSP No. FAS 115-2 and FAS 124-2. We recognized $29.7 million and $48.5 million of net impairment during the three and six months ended June 30, 2009, respectively, on certain securities in our non-agency CMO portfolio. The net impairment included gross OTTI of $199.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2009. Of the $199.8 million gross OTTI for the three months ended June 30, 2009, $170.1 million related to the noncredit portion of OTTI, which was recorded in other comprehensive loss. We had net impairment of $17.2 million and $43.8 million on certain securities in our non-agency CMO portfolio for the three and six months ended June 30, 2008, which represented the total decline in the fair value of the securities in accordance with SFAS No. 115, prior to it being amended by FSP No. FAS 115-2 and FAS 124-2.  Judgments  We consider OTTI for an available-for-sale debt security to have occurred if one of the following conditions are met: we intend to sell the impaired debt security; it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the impaired debt security before recovery of the security’s amortized cost basis; or we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security.  If we intend to sell an impaired debt security or if it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the impaired debt security before recovery of the security’s amortized cost basis, we will recognize OTTI in earnings equal to the entire difference between the security’s amortized cost basis and the security’s fair value.  For impaired available-for-sale debt securities that we do not to intend to sell and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell before recovery of the security’s amortized cost basis, we use both qualitative and quantitative valuation measures to evaluate whether we expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security. We consider all available information relevant to the collectability of the security, including credit     40    Table of Contents  enhancements, security structure, vintage, credit ratings and other relevant collateral characteristics. If, as a result of this analysis, we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security, we will separate OTTI into two components: 1) the amount related to credit loss, recognized in earnings and 2) the noncredit portion of OTTI recognized in other comprehensive loss.  If the impairment of an available-for-sale equity security is determined to be other-than-temporary, we will recognize OTTI in earnings equal to the entire difference between the security’s amortized cost basis and the security’s fair value. We assess available-for-sale securities for OTTI at each reported balance sheet date.  Effects if Actual Results Differ  Determining if a security is other-than-temporarily impaired is complex and requires judgment by management about circumstances that are inherently uncertain. Subsequent evaluations of these securities, in light of factors then prevailing, may result in additional OTTI in future periods. If all available-for-sale securities with fair values lower than amortized cost were other-than-temporarily impaired and the gross OTTI was recorded through earnings, we would record a pre-tax loss of $421.0 million.    41    Table of Contents GLOSSARY OF TERMS  Active Trader—The customer segment that includes those who execute 30 or more trades per quarter.

There is usually a premium paid by the buyer of such a contract.  Interest rate swaps—Contracts that are entered into primarily as an asset/liability management strategy to reduce interest rate risk. Interest rate swap contracts are exchanges of interest rate payments, such as fixed-rate payments for floating-rate payments, based on notional principal amounts.  Main Street Investor—The customer segment that includes those who execute less than 30 trades per quarter and hold less than $50,000 in assets in combined accounts.  Mass Affluent—The customer segment that includes those who hold $50,000 or more in assets in combined accounts.

This calculation is for E*TRADE Bank only.  Swaptions—Options to enter swaps starting on a given day.  Sweep deposit accounts—Accounts with the functionality to transfer brokerage cash balances to and from a Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”)-insured money market account at the Bank.    44    Table of Contents Taxable equivalent interest adjustment—The operating interest income earned on certain assets is completely or partially exempt from federal and/or state income tax. As such, these tax-exempt instruments typically yield lower returns than a taxable investment. To provide more meaningful comparison of yields and margins for all interest-earning assets, the interest income earned on tax exempt assets is increased to make it fully equivalent to interest income on other taxable investments. This adjustment is done for the analytic purposes in the net enterprise interest income/spread calculation and is not made on the consolidated statement loss, as that is not permitted under GAAP.  Tier 1 capital—Adjusted equity capital used in the calculation of capital adequacy ratios at E*TRADE Bank as required by the OTS. Tier 1 capital equals: total shareholder’s equity at E*TRADE Bank, plus/(less) unrealized losses (gains) on available-for-sale securities and cash flow hedges, less deferred tax assets, goodwill and certain other intangible assets.  Troubled Debt Restructuring (“TDR”)—A loan modification that involves granting an economic concession to a borrower who is experiencing financial difficulty.    45    Table of Contents   ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  The following discussion about our market risk disclosure includes forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including, but not limited to, those set forth in Item 1A. “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008 and as updated in this report. Market risk is our exposure to changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and equity and commodity prices. Our exposure to interest rate risk is related primarily to interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.  Interest Rate Risk  The management of interest rate risk is essential to profitability. Interest rate risk is our exposure to changes in interest rates. In general, we manage our interest rate risk by balancing variable-rate and fixed-rate assets and liabilities and we utilize derivatives in a way that reduces our overall exposure to changes in interest rates. In recent years, we have managed our interest rate risk to achieve a minimum to moderate risk profile with limited exposure to earnings volatility resulting from interest rate fluctuations. Exposure to interest rate risk requires management to make complex assumptions regarding maturities, market interest rates and customer behavior. Changes in interest rates, including the following, could impact interest income and expense:        •    Interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities may re-price at different times or by different amounts creating a mismatch.        •    The yield curve may flatten or change shape affecting the spread between short- and long-term rates. Widening or narrowing spreads could impact net interest income.        •    Market interest rates may influence prepayments resulting in maturity mismatches. In addition, prepayments could impact yields as premium and discounts amortize.  Exposure to market risk is dependent upon the distribution and composition of interest-earning assets, interest-bearing liabilities and derivatives. The differing risk characteristics of each product are managed to mitigate our exposure to interest rate fluctuations. At June 30, 2009, 93% of our total assets were enterprise interest-earning assets.  At June 30, 2009, approximately 66% of our total assets were residential real estate loans and available-for-sale mortgage-backed securities. The values of these assets are sensitive to changes in interest rates, as well as expected prepayment levels. As interest rates increase, fixed rate residential mortgages and mortgage-backed securities tend to exhibit lower prepayments. The inverse is true in a falling rate environment.  When real estate loans prepay, unamortized premiums are written off. Depending on the timing of the prepayment, the write-offs of unamortized premiums may result in lower than anticipated yields. E*TRADE Bank’s Asset Liability Committee (“ALCO”) reviews estimates of the impact of changing market rates on prepayments. This information is incorporated into our interest rate risk management strategy.  Our liability structure consists of two central sources of funding: deposits and wholesale borrowings. Cash provided to us through deposits is the primary source of our funding. Our key deposit products include sweep accounts, money market and savings accounts and certificates of deposit. Our wholesale borrowings include securities sold under agreements to repurchase and FHLB advances. Customer payables, which represents customer cash contained within our broker-dealers, is an additional source of funding. In addition, the parent company has issued a significant amount of corporate debt.  Our deposit accounts and customer payables tend to be less rate-sensitive than wholesale borrowings. Agreements to repurchase securities re-price as interest rates change. Sweep, money market and savings accounts re-price at management’s discretion. Certificates of deposit re-price over time depending on maturities. FHLB advances and corporate debt generally have fixed rates.    46    Table of Contents Derivative Instruments  We use derivative instruments to help manage our interest rate risk. Interest rate swaps involve the exchange of fixed-rate and variable-rate interest payments between two parties based on a contractual underlying notional amount, but do not involve the exchange of the underlying notional amounts. Option products are utilized primarily to decrease the market value changes resulting from the prepayment dynamics of the mortgage portfolio, as well as to protect against increases in funding costs. The types of options employed include Cap Options (“Caps”) and Floor Options (“Floors”), “Payor Swaptions” and “Receiver Swaptions.” Caps mitigate the market risk associated with increases in interest rates while Floors mitigate the risk associated with decreases in market interest rates. Similarly, Payor and Receiver Swaptions mitigate the market risk associated with the respective increases and decreases in interest rates. See derivative instruments discussion at Note 6—Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities in Item 1. Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited).  Scenario Analysis  Scenario analysis is an advanced approach to estimating interest rate risk exposure. Under the NPVE approach, the present value of all existing assets, liabilities, derivatives and forward commitments are estimated and then combined to produce a NPVE figure. The sensitivity of this value to changes in interest rates is then determined by applying alternative interest rate scenarios, which include, but are not limited to, instantaneous parallel shifts up 100, 200 and 300 basis points and down 100 and 200 basis points. The NPVE method is used at the E*TRADE Bank level and not for the Company. During the period ended June 30, 2009, E*TRADE Securities LLC became a wholly-owned operating subsidiary of E*TRADE Bank.  E*TRADE Bank has 97% and 98% of our enterprise interest-earning assets at June 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively, and holds 98% of our enterprise interest-bearing liabilities at both June 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008. The sensitivity of NPVE at June 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008 and the limits established by E*TRADE Bank’s Board of Directors are listed below (dollars in thousands):                             Change in NPVE      Board Limit      Parallel Change in Interest Rates (basis points)(2)   June 30, 2009(1)     December 31, 2008         Amount       Percentage       Amount       Percentage       +300   $ (675,933 )    (21 )%    $ (65,600 )    (3 )%    (55 )%   +200   $ (394,706 )    (12 )%    $ 68,853     3 %    (30 )%   +100   $ (145,466 )    (5 )%    $ 119,407     5 %    (20 )%   -100   $ 51,886     2 %    $ (334,132 )    (14 )%    (20 )%       (1)    Amounts and percentages include E*TRADE Securities LLC.    (2)    On June 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008, the yield on the three-month Treasury bill was 0.19% and 0.11%, respectively. As a result, the OTS temporarily modified the requirements of the NPV Model, resulting in removal of the minus 200 and 300 basis points scenarios for the periods ended June 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008.  Under criteria published by the OTS, E*TRADE Bank’s overall interest rate risk exposure at June 30, 2009 was characterized as “minimum.” We actively manage our interest rate risk positions. As interest rates change, we will re-adjust our strategy and mix of assets, liabilities and derivatives to optimize our position. For example, a 100 basis points increase in rates may not result in a change in value as indicated above. The ALCO monitors E*TRADE Bank’s interest rate risk position.  Other Market Risk  Equity Security Risk  Equity securities risk is the risk of potential loss from investing in public and private equity securities including foreign currency exchange risk. We hold equity securities for corporate investment purposes and in trading securities for market-making purposes. The foreign currency exchange risk associated with these investments is not material to the Company. For corporate investment purposes, we currently hold publicly traded equity securities, in which we had an estimated fair value of $0.7 million as of June 30, 2009.

See accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements    53    Table of Contents E*TRADE FINANCIAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)  NOTE 1—ORGANIZATION, BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  Organization—E*TRADE Financial Corporation is a financial services company that provides online brokerage and related products and services primarily to individual investors under the brand “E*TRADE Financial.” Our products and services include investor-focused banking, primarily sweep deposits and savings products and asset gathering. The Company’s most significant subsidiaries are described below:        •    E*TRADE Bank is a Federally chartered savings bank that provides investor-focused banking services to retail customers nationwide and deposit accounts insured by the FDIC;        •    E*TRADE Capital Markets, LLC is a registered broker-dealer and market-maker;        •    E*TRADE Clearing LLC is the clearing firm for the Company’s brokerage subsidiaries and is a wholly-owned operating subsidiary of E*TRADE Bank. Its main purpose is to transfer securities from one party to another; and        •    E*TRADE Securities LLC is a registered broker-dealer and became a wholly-owned operating subsidiary of E*TRADE Bank in June 2009. It is the primary provider of brokerage services to the Company’s customers.  Basis of Presentation—The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its majority-owned subsidiaries. Entities in which the Company holds at least a 20% ownership or in which there are other indicators of significant influence are generally accounted for by the equity method. Entities in which the Company holds less than 20% ownership and does not have the ability to exercise significant influence are generally carried at cost. Intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. The Company evaluates investments including joint ventures, low income housing tax credit partnerships and other limited partnerships to determine if the Company is required to consolidate the entities under the guidance of FASB Interpretation No. 46 revised, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities-an interpretation of ARB No. 51 (“FIN 46R”).  Certain prior period items in these consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. The operations of certain businesses have been accounted for as discontinued operations in accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. Accordingly, results of operations from prior periods have been reclassified to discontinued operations. Unless noted, discussions herein pertain to the Company’s continuing operations. The Company evaluated events or transactions occurring after June 30, 2009 through August 6, 2009 for potential recognition or disclosure in the financial statements. These consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, which are all normal and recurring in nature, necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented, and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of E*TRADE Financial Corporation included in the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed May 14, 2009.  On April 1, 2009, the Company adopted FSP No. FAS 115-2 and FAS 124-2, which amends the OTTI accounting guidance for debt securities as well as the presentation of OTTI on the consolidated financial statements. In accordance with the new guidance, the Company changed the presentation of the consolidated statement of loss to state “Net impairment” as a separate line item, as well as the credit and noncredit components of net impairment. Prior to this new presentation, OTTI was included in the “Gain on loans and securities, net” line item on the consolidated statement of loss.  The Company reports corporate interest income and corporate interest expense separately from operating interest income and operating interest expense. The Company believes reporting these two items separately provides a clearer picture of the financial performance of the Company’s operations than would a presentation     54    Table of Contents  that combined these two items. Operating interest income and operating interest expense is generated from the operations of the Company. Corporate debt, which is the primary source of the corporate interest expense, has been issued primarily in connection with the transaction with Citadel Investment Group LLC and its affiliates (“Citadel”) in 2007 and past acquisitions, such as Harrisdirect and BrownCo.  Similarly, the Company reports gain (loss) on sales of investments, net separately from gain on loans and securities, net. The Company believes reporting these two items separately provides a clearer picture of the financial performance of its operations than would a presentation that combined these two items. Gain on loans and securities, net is the result of activities in the Company’s operations, namely its balance sheet management segment. Gain (loss) on sales of investments, net relates to historical equity investments of the Company at the corporate level and is not related to the ongoing business of the Company’s operating subsidiaries.  Use of Estimates—The consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with GAAP, which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and related notes for the periods presented. Actual results could differ from management’s estimates. Material estimates in which management believes near-term changes could reasonably occur include allowance for loan losses; fair value measurements; classification and valuation of certain investments; accounting for derivative instruments; estimates of effective tax rates, deferred taxes and valuation allowances; valuation of goodwill and other intangibles; and valuation and expensing of share-based payments.  Financial Statement Descriptions and Related Accounting Policies—Financial statement descriptions and related accounting policies are more fully described in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data in the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed May 14, 2009. Below are descriptions and accounting policies for certain of the Company’s financial statement categories as updated in this report.  Available-for-Sale Mortgage-Backed and Investment Securities—The Company classified its debt securities and marketable equity securities as either trading or available-for-sale. None of the Company’s debt or marketable equity securities were classified as held-to-maturity as of June 30, 2009 or December 31, 2008.  Available-for-sale securities consist primarily of debt securities, specifically residential mortgage-backed securities, as of June 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008. Securities classified as available-for-sale are carried at fair value, with the unrealized gains and losses reflected as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax. Realized and unrealized gains or losses on available-for-sale debt securities are computed using the specific identification method. Amortization or accretion of premiums and discounts are recognized in interest income using the interest method over the life of the security. Realized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities, other than OTTI, are included in the gain on loans and securities, net line item. OTTI is included in the net impairment line item. Interest earned on available-for-sale debt securities is included in operating interest income. Available-for-sale securities that have an unrealized loss (impaired securities) are evaluated for OTTI at each balance sheet date.  Beginning in the second quarter of 2009, the Company’s OTTI evaluation for available-for-sale debt securities reflects the Company’s adoption of FSP No. FAS 115-2 and FAS 124-2. The Company considers OTTI for an available-for-sale debt security to have occurred if one of the following conditions are met: the Company intends to sell the impaired debt security; it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the impaired debt security before recovery of the security’s amortized cost basis; or the Company does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security. For impaired available-for-sale debt securities that the Company does not to intend to sell and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell before recovery of the security’s amortized cost basis, the Company uses both qualitative and quantitative valuation measures to evaluate whether the Company expects to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security. The Company considers all available information relevant to the collectability of the security, including credit enhancements, security structure, vintage, credit ratings and other relevant collateral characteristics.    55    Table of Contents Margin Receivables—At June 30, 2009, the fair value of securities that the Company received as collateral in connection with margin receivables and stock borrowing activities, where the Company is permitted to sell or re-pledge the securities, was approximately $4.4 billion. Of this amount, $1.2 billion had been pledged or sold at June 30, 2009 in connection with securities loans, bank borrowings and deposits with clearing organizations.  Loans, Net—Loans, net consists of real estate and consumer loans that management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity, also known as loans held for investment. Loans, net also includes our loans held for sale, which represent loans originated through, but not yet purchased by, a third party company that the Company partnered with to provide access to real estate loans for its customers. There is a short time period after closing in which the Company records the originated loan as held for sale prior to the third party company purchasing the loan. The Company’s commitment to sell mortgage loans was the same balance as the loans held for sale at June 30, 2009.  Loans that are held for investment are carried at amortized cost adjusted for charge-offs, net, allowance for loan losses, deferred fees or costs on originated loans and unamortized premiums or discounts on purchased loans. Loan fees and certain direct loan origination costs are deferred and the net fee or cost is recognized in operating interest income using the interest method over the contractual life of the loans. Premiums and discounts on purchased loans are amortized or accreted into income using the interest method over the remaining period to contractual maturity and adjusted for actual prepayments. Modified loans in which an economic concession was granted to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty are considered TDRs in accordance with SFAS No. 15, Accounting by Debtors and Creditors for Troubled Debt Restructurings.  The Company classifies loans as nonperforming when full and timely collection of interest or principal becomes uncertain or when they are 90 days past due. TDRs are accounted for as nonaccrual loans at the time of modification and return to accrual status after six consecutive payments are made in accordance with the modified terms. Interest previously accrued, but not collected, is reversed against current income when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status and is considered nonperforming. Accretion of deferred fees is discontinued for nonperforming loans. Payments received on nonperforming loans are recognized as interest income when the loan is considered collectible and applied to principal when it is doubtful that full payment will be collected.  The Company’s charge-off policy for both one- to four-family and home equity loans is to assess the value of the property when the loan has been delinquent for 180 days or it is in bankruptcy, regardless of whether or not the property is in foreclosure, and charge-off the amount of the loan balance in excess of the estimated current property value. Credit cards are charged-off when collection is not probable or the loan has been delinquent for 180 days. Consumer loans are charged-off when the loan has been delinquent for 120 days or when it is determined that collection is not probable.  Allowance for Loan Losses—The allowance for loan losses is management’s estimate of credit losses inherent in the Company’s loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date.  For loans that are not specifically identified for impairment under SFAS No. 114, the allowance is assessed in accordance with SFAS No. 5. The estimate of the allowance for loan losses is based on a variety of factors, including the composition and quality of the portfolio; delinquency levels and trends; current and historical charge-off and loss experience; current industry charge-off and loss experience; the condition of the real estate market and geographic concentrations within the loan portfolio; the interest rate climate; the overall availability of housing credit; and general economic conditions. The Company’s one- to four-family and home equity loan portfolios are separated into risk segments based on key risk factors, which include but are not limited to channel of loan origination, documentation type, loan product type and LTV ratio. Based upon the segmentation, probable losses are determined with expected loss rates in each segment. The additional protection provided by mortgage insurance and the CDS has been factored into the expected loss on defaulted mortgage loans. The expected recovery from the liquidation of foreclosed real estate and expected recoveries from loan sellers related to contractual guarantees are also factored into the expected loss on defaulted mortgage loans. For the consumer     56    Table of Contents  and other loan portfolio, management establishes loss estimates for each consumer portfolio based on credit characteristics and observation of the existing markets. The expected recoveries from the sale of repossessed collateral are factored into the expected loss on defaulted consumer loans based on current liquidation experience. Loan losses are charged and recoveries are credited to the allowance for loan losses. The allowance for loan losses is typically equal to management’s estimate of loan charge-offs in the twelve months following the balance sheet date. Management believes this level is representative of probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date.  For modified loans accounted for as TDRs, the Company establishes a specific allowance in accordance with SFAS No. 114. Under SFAS No. 114, the impairment of a loan is measured using a discounted cash flow analysis. A specific allowance is established to the extent that the recorded investment exceeds the discounted cash flows of a TDR with a corresponding charge to the provision for loan losses. The specific allowance for these individually impaired loans represents the expected loss over the remaining life of the loan, including the economic concession to the borrower.  Determining the adequacy of the allowance is complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Subsequent evaluations of the loan portfolio, in light of the factors then prevailing, may result in significant changes in the allowance for loan losses in future periods.  Gain on Loans and Securities, Net—Gain on loans and securities, net includes gains or losses resulting from the sale of available-for-sale securities; gains or losses on trading securities; gains or losses resulting from sales of loans; hedge ineffectiveness; and gains or losses on derivative instruments that are not accounted for as hedging instruments under SFAS No. 133, as amended. Gains or losses resulting from the sale of loans are recognized at the date of settlement and are based on the difference between the cash received and the carrying value of the related loans, less related transaction costs. Nonrefundable fees and direct costs associated with the origination of mortgage loans are deferred and recognized when the related loans are sold. Gains or losses resulting from the sale of available-for-sale securities are recognized at the trade date, based on the difference between the anticipated proceeds and the amortized cost of the specific securities sold.  Net Impairment—Net impairment includes OTTI net of the noncredit portion of OTTI on debt securities recognized in other comprehensive loss (before tax). If the Company intends to sell an impaired debt security or if it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the impaired debt security before recovery of the security’s amortized cost basis, the Company will recognize OTTI in earnings equal to the entire difference between the security’s amortized cost basis and the security’s fair value. If the Company does not intend to sell the impaired debt security and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the impaired debt security before recovery of its amortized cost basis but the Company does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security, the Company will separate OTTI into two components: 1) the amount related to credit loss, recognized in earnings and 2) the noncredit portion of OTTI recognized in other comprehensive loss. If the impairment of an available-for-sale equity security is determined to be other-than-temporary, the Company will recognize OTTI in earnings equal to the entire difference between the security’s amortized cost basis and the security’s fair value.  New Accounting Standards—Below are the new accounting pronouncements that relate to activities in which the Company is engaged.  SFAS No. 161—Disclosures About Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities  In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, Disclosures About Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (“SFAS No. 161”). This statement establishes, among other things, the disclosure requirements for derivative instruments and hedging activities. This statement became effective on January 1, 2009 for the Company. The Company’s disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities in Note 6—Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities reflect the adoption of this statement.    57    Table of Contents SFAS No. 165—Subsequent Events  In May 2009, the FASB issued SFAS No. 165, Subsequent Events (“SFAS No. 165”). This statement establishes general standards of accounting and disclosure for events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued (subsequent events). The two types of subsequent events include those that provide additional evidence about conditions that existed at the date of the balance sheet, including the estimates inherent in the process of preparing financial statements (recognized subsequent events) and those that provide evidence about conditions that did not exist at the date of the balance sheet but arose after that date (nonrecognized subsequent events). The Company adopted SFAS No. 165 for the period ended June 30, 2009 and will apply SFAS No. 165 prospectively. The adoption of SFAS No. 165 did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.  SFAS No. 166—Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assets  In June 2009, the FASB issued SFAS No. 166, Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assets (“SFAS No. 166”). This statement amends the derecognition guidance in SFAS No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities, including the removal of the concept of qualifying special-purpose entities (“QSPEs”). This statement is effective for financial asset transfers occurring after the beginning of the first fiscal year that begins after November 15, 2009, or January 1, 2010 for the Company. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 166 on its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in future periods.  SFAS No. 167—Amendments to FIN 46R  In June 2009, the FASB issued SFAS No. 167, Amendments to FIN 46R (“SFAS No. 167”), which amends the accounting and disclosure guidance in FIN 46R. This statement requires the reconsideration of previous FIN 46R conclusions, including whether an entity is a variable interest entity and whether the Company is the variable interest entity’s primary beneficiary. This statement carries forward the scope of FIN 46R, with the addition of entities previously considered QSPEs. This statement is effective as of the beginning of the first fiscal year that begins after November 15, 2009, or January 1, 2010 for the Company. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 167 on its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in future periods.  SFAS No. 168—The FASB Accounting Standards Codification™ and the Hierarchy of GAAP  In June 2009, the FASB issued SFAS No. 168, The FASB Accounting Standards Codification™ and the Hierarchy of GAAP (“SFAS No. 168”). SFAS No. 168 replaced SFAS No. 162, The Hierarchy of GAAP and established the FASB Accounting Standards Codification™ (“the Codification”) as the source of authoritative GAAP for the Company. Rules and interpretative releases of the SEC under federal securities laws also continue to be a source of authoritative GAAP for the Company. All guidance contained in the Codification carries an equal level of authority. This statement is effective for financial statements issued for interim and annual periods ending after September 15, 2009, or September 30, 2009 for the Company. The Company does not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material impact on its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows in future periods.  FSP No. FAS 141R-1—Accounting for Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed in a Business Combination That Arise from Contingencies  In April 2009, the FASB issued FSP No. FAS 141R-1, Accounting for Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed in a Business Combination That Arise from Contingencies (“FSP No. FAS 141R-1”). FSP No. FAS 141R-1 amends and clarifies SFAS No. 141R, Business Combinations, to address application issues raised by preparers, auditors, and members of the legal profession on initial recognition and measurement, subsequent measurement and accounting, and disclosure of assets and liabilities arising from contingencies in a business     58    Table of Contents  combination. FSP No. FAS 141R-1 is effective for assets or liabilities arising from contingencies in business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after January 1, 2009 for the Company and had no impact on its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.  FSP No. FAS 107-1 and APB 28-1—Interim Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments  In April 2009, the FASB issued FSP No. FAS 107-1 and APB 28-1, Interim Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments (“FSP No. FAS 107-1 and APB 28-1”). FSP No. FAS 107-1 and APB 28-1 amends SFAS No. 107, Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments (“SFAS No. 107”), to require disclosures about fair value of financial instruments for interim reporting periods of publicly traded companies as well as in annual financial statements. The Company’s disclosures about fair value of financial instruments in Note 3—Fair Value Disclosures reflect the adoption of this FSP.  FSP No. FAS 115-2 and FAS 124-2—Recognition and Presentation of Other-Than-Temporary Impairments  In April 2009, the FASB issued FSP No. FAS 115-2 and FAS 124-2, which amends the other-than-temporary impairment accounting guidance for debt securities and the presentation and disclosure requirements of other-than-temporary impairments on debt and equity securities in the financial statements. This FSP does not amend existing recognition and measurement guidance related to other-than-temporary impairments of equity securities. The Company adopted this FSP on April 1, 2009. As a result of the adoption, the Company recognized a $20.2 million after-tax increase to beginning retained earnings and a corresponding offset in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the consolidated balance sheet as of April 1, 2009. For additional information regarding the adoption of this FSP, see Note 4—Available-for-Sale Mortgage-Backed and Investment Securities.  FSP No. FAS 157-4—Determining Fair Value When the Volume and Level of Activity for the Asset or Liability Have Significantly Decreased and Identifying Transactions That Are Not Orderly  In April 2009, the FASB issued FSP No. FAS 157-4, Determining Fair Value When the Volume and Level of Activity for the Asset or Liability Have Significantly Decreased and Identifying Transactions That Are Not Orderly (“FSP No. FAS 157-4”). FSP No. FAS 157-4 provides additional guidance for estimating fair value in accordance with SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (“SFAS No. 157”), when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased. FSP No. FAS 157-4 also includes guidance on identifying circumstances that indicate a transaction is not orderly. The Company adopted this FSP on April 1, 2009. The adoption of FSP No. FAS 157-4 did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.    59    Table of Contents NOTE 2—OPERATING INTEREST INCOME AND OPERATING INTEREST EXPENSE  The following table shows the components of operating interest income and operating interest expense from continuing operations (dollars in thousands):                            Three Months EndedJune 30,     Six Months EndedJune 30,        2009     2008     2009     2008     Operating interest income:                       Loans, net   $ 292,509     $ 402,103     $ 605,837     $ 853,677     Mortgage-backed and investment securities     130,069       97,530       257,138       206,739     Margin receivables     31,412       75,382       58,349       166,319     Other     31,528       51,059       50,831       98,930                                       Total operating interest income     485,518       626,074       972,155       1,325,665                                       Operating interest expense:                       Deposits     (53,516 )      (151,711 )      (150,530 )      (338,415 )    Repurchase agreements and other borrowings     (55,607 )      (68,630 )      (121,682 )      (163,564 )    FHLB advances     (34,152 )      (51,609 )      (75,356 )      (122,411 )    Other     (2,653 )      (11,360 )      (6,335 )      (32,140 )                                      Total operating interest expense     (145,928 )      (283,310 )      (353,903 )      (656,530 )                                      Net operating interest income   $ 339,590     $ 342,764     $ 618,252     $ 669,135                                      NOTE 3—FAIR VALUE DISCLOSURES  SFAS No. 157 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In determining fair value, the Company may use various valuation approaches, including market, income and/or cost approaches. The fair value hierarchy established in SFAS No. 157 requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Fair value is a market-based measure considered from the perspective of a market participant. As such, even when market assumptions are not readily available, the Company’s own assumptions reflect those that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. The standard describes the following three levels used to classify fair value measurements:        •    Level 1—Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.        •    Level 2—Quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly.        •    Level 3—Unobservable inputs that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.  The availability of observable inputs can vary and in certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, the level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The Company’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to a fair value measurement requires judgment and consideration of factors specific to the asset or liability.  Recurring Fair Value Measurement Valuation Techniques  U.S. Treasury and Agency Debentures  The fair value measurements of U.S. Treasury and agency debentures are based on quoted market prices and are generally classified as Level 1 or Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.    60    Table of Contents Agency Mortgage-backed Securities and Collateralized Mortgage Obligations  Agency mortgage-backed securities include to be announced securities and mortgage pass-through certificates. The fair value of agency mortgage-backed securities is determined using quoted market prices, recent market transactions and spread data for similar instruments. Agency mortgage-backed securities are generally categorized in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Agency CMOs include collateralized mortgage obligations backed by agency-guaranteed loans. The fair value of agency CMOs is determined using market information corroborated by recent market transactions. Agency CMOs are generally categorized in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.  Non-agency Collateralized Mortgage Obligations  Non-agency CMOs are typically valued using market observable data, when available, including recent external market transactions for similar instruments. The Company also utilized a pricing service to corroborate the market observability of the Company’s inputs used in the fair value measurements. The valuations of non-agency CMOs reflect the Company’s best estimate of what market participants would consider in pricing the financial instruments. The Company considers the price transparency for these financial instruments to be a key determinant of the degree of judgment involved in determining the fair value. As of June 30, 2009, the majority of the Company’s non-agency CMOs were categorized in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.  Municipal Bonds and Corporate Bonds  For municipal bonds and corporate bonds, the Company’s valuation utilized recent market transactions for identical bonds or pricing service valuations corroborated by recent market transactions for similar bonds. Municipal bonds and corporate bonds are generally categorized in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.  Derivative Instruments  The majority of the Company’s derivative instruments, interest rate swap and option contracts, are valued with pricing models commonly used by the financial services industry using market observable pricing inputs. The Company does not consider these models to involve significant judgment on the part of management and corroborated the fair value measurements with counterparty valuations. The Company’s derivative instruments are generally categorized in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The consideration of credit risk, the Company’s or the counterparty’s, did not result in an adjustment to the valuation of its derivative instruments in the periods presented.  Securities Owned and Securities Sold, Not Yet Purchased  Securities transactions entered into by certain broker-dealer subsidiaries are included in trading securities and securities sold, not yet purchased in the Company’s SFAS No. 157 disclosures. For equity securities, the Company’s definition of actively traded is based on average daily volume and other market trading statistics. The fair value of securities owned and securities sold, not yet purchased is determined using listed or quoted market prices and are generally categorized in Level 1 or Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.  Servicing Rights  The Company accounts for servicing rights under the fair value measurement method. The fair value of the servicing rights is determined using models that include observable inputs, if available. To the extent observable inputs are not available, the Company estimates fair value based on the present value of expected future cash flows using its best estimate of the key assumptions, including anticipated loan prepayments and discount rates. Servicing rights are categorized as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy when unobservable inputs are significant to the fair value measurements.    61    Table of Contents Recurring Fair Value Measurements  Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below (dollars in thousands):                        Level 1   Level 2   Level 3   Fair Value   June 30, 2009:                   Assets                   Trading securities   $ 16,731   $ 8,703   $ 12,172   $ 37,606                             Available-for-sale securities:                   Residential mortgage-backed securities:                   Agency mortgage-backed securities and CMOs     —      10,025,069     —      10,025,069   Non-agency CMOs and other     —      217,322     274,385     491,707                             Total residential mortgage-backed securities     —      10,242,391     274,385     10,516,776                             Investment securities:                   Debt securities:                   U.S. Treasury and agency debentures     96,656     133,119     —      229,775   Municipal bonds     —      82,798     —      82,798   Corporate bonds     —      11,789     —      11,789                             Total debt securities     96,656     227,706     —      324,362   Public traded equity securities:                   Corporate investments     —      559     170     729                             Total investment securities     96,656     228,265     170     325,091                             Total available-for-sale securities     96,656     10,470,656     274,555     10,841,867                             Other assets:                   Derivative assets     —      97,966     —      97,966   Deposits with clearing organizations(1)     30,000     —      —      30,000   Servicing rights     —      —      7,148     7,148                             Total other assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis     30,000     97,966     7,148     135,114                             Total assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis(2)   $ 143,387   $ 10,577,325   $ 293,875   $ 11,014,587                             Liabilities                   Derivative liabilities   $ —    $ 175,114   $ —    $ 175,114   Securities sold, not yet purchased     15,126     833     —      15,959                             Total liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis(2)   $ 15,126   $ 175,947   $ —    $ 191,073                                (1)    As of June 30, 2009, deposits with clearing organizations includes U.S. Treasuries deposited with clearing organizations by a broker-dealer subsidiary.

(2)    As of December 31, 2008, assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis represented 23% and 1% of the Company’s total assets and total liabilities, respectively.  Both observable and unobservable inputs may be used to determine the fair value of positions that the Company has classified within the Level 3 category. As a result, the realized and unrealized gains and losses for assets and liabilities within the Level 3 category presented in the tables below may include changes in fair value that were attributable to both observable and unobservable inputs. The following tables present additional information about Level 3 assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis for the three and six months ended June 30, 2009 and 2008, respectively (dollars in thousands):                                            Realized and Unrealized Gains (Losses)                        March 31,2009     Included inEarnings(1)     Included inOtherComprehensiveIncome   Total(2)     Purchases,Sales, OtherSettlements andIssuances Net     Net TransfersIn and/or(Out) ofLevel 3(3)     June 30,2009   Trading securities   $ 30,643     $ 1,129     $ —    $ 1,129     $ (19,606 )    $ 6     $ 12,172            Available-for-sale securities:                                    Non-agency CMOs and other   $ 524,245     $ (26,791 )    $ 26,480   $ (311 )    $ (21,652 )    $ (227,897 )    $ 274,385   Corporate investments   $ 163     $ —      $ 7   $ 7     $ —      $ —      $ 170   Servicing rights   $ 6,048     $ 1,100     $ —    $ 1,100     $ —      $ —      $ 7,148   Derivative instruments, net(4)   $ (500 )    $ 500     $ —    $ 500     $ —      $ —      $ —       (1)    The majority of realized and unrealized gains (losses) included in earnings are reported in the net impairment line item.

(4)    Represents derivative assets net of derivative liabilities for presentation purposes only.  Level 3 Assets and Liabilities  Level 3 assets and liabilities included instruments whose value is determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation. As of June 30, 2009, less than 1% of the Company’s total assets and none of its total liabilities represented instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis categorized as Level 3.  In general, level classification transfers in and out of Level 3 during the three and six months ended June 30, 2009 were driven by changes in price transparency in the non-agency CMO market during the period. The Company’s transfers in and out of Level 3 are as of the beginning of the reporting period on a quarterly basis. While the Company’s fair value estimates of Level 3 instruments as of June 30, 2009 utilized observable inputs where available, the valuation included significant management judgment in determining the relevance and reliability of market information considered and the financial instruments were therefore classified as Level 3.  Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements  Financial Instruments  The Company also measures certain other financial instruments at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in accordance with GAAP. The Company’s charge-off policy for both one- to four-family and home equity loans is to assess the value of the property when the loan has been delinquent for 180 days or it is in bankruptcy, regardless of whether or not the property is in foreclosure, and charge-off the amount of the loan balance in excess of the estimated current property value. The Company classified these fair value measurements, approximately $394 million and $588 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2009 and $108 million and $142 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2008, as Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy as the valuations included Level 3 inputs that were significant to the estimate of fair value. These fair value measurements resulted in $129.5 million and $237.1 million of charge-offs for the three and six months ended June 30, 2009 and $47.1 million and $77.1 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2008.    65    Table of Contents Nonfinancial Instruments  The Company measures certain nonfinancial instruments at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in accordance with GAAP. The Company adopted certain provisions of SFAS No. 157 on January 1, 2009 as they relate to nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are not recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. Included in the other assets line item in the consolidated balance sheet is real estate acquired through foreclosure which is recorded at the lower of carrying value or fair value, less estimated selling costs. The Company classified these fair value measurements, approximately $40 million and $89 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2009, as Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy as the majority of the valuations included Level 3 inputs that were significant to the estimate of fair value. These fair value measurements resulted in $8.1 million and $24.0 million in write-downs for the three and six months ended June 30, 2009.  Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments  SFAS No. 107 requires the disclosure of the estimated fair value of financial instruments. The following disclosure of the estimated fair value of financial instruments, not otherwise disclosed above pursuant to SFAS No. 157, is made by the Company in accordance with SFAS No. 157. Different market assumptions and estimation methodologies could significantly affect estimated fair value amounts. Effective April 1, 2009, the Company adopted FSP No. FAS 107-1 and APB 28-1, which requires disclosure about fair value of financial instruments for interim reporting periods as well as in annual financial statements.  The fair value of financial instruments, not otherwise disclosed above pursuant to SFAS No. 157, whose estimated fair value approximates carrying value is summarized as follows:        •    Cash and equivalents, cash and investments required to be segregated, margin receivables and customer payables—Fair value is estimated to be carrying value.        •    Investment in FHLB stock—FHLB stock is carried at cost, which is considered to be a reasonable estimate of fair value.  The fair value of financial instruments whose estimated fair values were different from their carrying values is summarized below (dollars in thousands):                        June 30, 2009   December 31, 2008      Carrying Value   Fair Value   Carrying Value   Fair Value   Assets                   Loans, net(1)   $ 21,939,043   $ 21,703,790   $ 24,451,852   $ 24,072,373         Liabilities                   Deposits   $ 26,423,824   $ 26,456,520   $ 26,136,246   $ 26,194,430   Securities sold under agreements to repurchase   $ 6,464,915   $ 6,552,523   $ 7,381,279   $ 7,488,380   Other borrowings   $ 3,369,511   $ 3,212,168   $ 4,353,777   $ 4,349,862   Corporate debt   $ 2,878,815   $ 3,875,943   $ 2,750,532   $ 1,645,136      (1)    The carrying value of loans, net includes the allowance for loan losses of $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion as of June 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008.        •    Loans, net—For loans held-for sale, fair value is estimated using third party commitments to purchase loans. For the held-for-investment portfolio, including one- to four-family, home equity, recreational vehicle, marine and auto loans, fair value is estimated by differentiating loans based on their individual characteristics, such as product classification, loan category, pricing features and remaining maturity. Management adjusts assumptions for expected losses, prepayments and discount rates to reflect the individual characteristics of the loans, such as credit risk, coupon, term, and payment characteristics, as well as the secondary market conditions for these types of loans. For commercial and credit card loans, fair value is estimated based on both individual and portfolio characteristics and recent market transactions, when available.    66    Table of Contents     •    Deposits—For sweep deposit accounts, money market and savings accounts and checking accounts, fair value is the amount payable on demand at the reporting date. For certificates of deposit and brokered certificates of deposits, fair value is estimated by discounting future cash flows at the currently offered rates for deposits of similar remaining maturities.        •    Securities sold under agreements to repurchase—Fair value is determined by discounting future cash flows at the rate implied for other similar instruments with similar remaining maturities.        •    Other borrowings—For FHLB advances, fair value is estimated by discounting future cash flows at the current offered rates for borrowings of similar remaining maturities. For Floating Rate Junior Subordinated Debentures issued by ETBH, fair value is estimated by discounting future cash flows at the rate implied by dealer pricing quotes. For margin collateral, overnight and other short-term borrowings and collateralized borrowings, fair value approximates carrying value.        •    Corporate debt—For the $1.3 billion of 12 1/2% Notes and almost all of the 8% Notes included in the offer to exchange for convertible debentures, fair value is based on the estimated fair value of the convertible debentures which considered the following: the intrinsic value of the underlying stock; the value of the option for bondholders to receive cash equal to the face value of the convertible debentures in ten years; and a liquidity discount. For all other corporate debt, fair value is estimated using dealer pricing quotes. For additional information regarding the pending debt exchange offer, see Note 9—Corporate Debt.  In the normal course of business, the Company makes various commitments to extend credit and incur contingent liabilities that are not reflected in the consolidated balance sheet. Significant changes in the economy or interest rates influence the impact that these commitments and contingencies have on the Company in the future. Information related to such commitments and contingent liabilities is detailed in Note 13—Commitments, Contingencies and Other Regulatory Matters.    67    Table of Contents NOTE 4—AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE

available-for-sale portfolio as of June 30, 2009 represents a credit related impairment. The majority of the unrealized losses on mortgage-backed securities are attributable to changes in interest rates and a re-pricing of risk in the market. All agency mortgage-backed securities and CMOs and U.S. Treasury and agency debentures are AAA-rated. Municipal bonds and corporate bonds are evaluated by reviewing the credit-worthiness of the issuer and general market conditions. The Company does not intend to sell the securities and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the debt securities before the anticipated recovery of its remaining amortized cost of the securities in an unrealized loss position at June 30, 2009.  Effective April 1, 2009, the Company adopted FSP No. FAS 115-2 and FAS 124-2 which amends the OTTI accounting guidance for debt securities. The Company assessed whether it intends to sell, or whether it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell a security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current-period credit losses. For debt securities that are considered other-than-temporarily impaired and that the Company does not intend to sell and will not be required to sell prior to recovery of its amortized cost basis, the Company determines the amount of the impairment that is credit related and the amount due to all other     69    Table of Contents  factors. The credit loss component is recognized in earnings and is the difference between the security’s amortized cost basis and the present value of its expected future cash flows. The noncredit loss component is recognized in other comprehensive loss and is the difference between the present value of its expected future cash flows and the fair value.  The majority of the Company’s available-for-sale portfolio consists of residential mortgage-backed securities. For residential mortgage-backed securities, the Company calculates the noncredit portion of OTTI by comparing the present value of the expected future cash flows with the amortized cost basis of the security. The expected future cash flows are determined using the remaining contractual cash flows adjusted for future credit losses. The estimate of expected future credit losses include the following assumptions: 1) expected default rates based on current delinquency trends, foreclosure statistics of the underlying mortgages and loan documentation type; 2) expected loss severity based on the underlying loan characteristics, including loan-to-value, origination vintage and geography; and 3) expected loan prepayments and principal reduction based on current experience and existing market conditions that may impact the future rate of prepayments. The expected cash flows of the security are then discounted at the interest rate used to recognize interest income on the security to arrive at the present value amount. The following table presents a summary of the significant inputs considered in determining the measurement of credit loss as of June 30, 2009:                 June 30, 2009      Weighted Average     Range   Default rate(1)   8 %    1% - 25%   Loss severity   41 %    40% - 45%   Prepayment rate   10 %    8% - 25%      (1)    Represents the expected default rate for the next twelve months.  The following table presents a roll-forward of the credit loss component of the amortized cost of debt securities, which has been recognized in earnings for the three months ended June 30, 2009 (dollars in thousands):               Three MonthsEnded June 30,2009   Credit loss balance, beginning of period   $ 80,060   Additions:       Initial credit impairment     11,727   Subsequent credit impairment     17,944           Credit loss balance, end of period   $ 109,731          Within the securities portfolio, the highest concentration of credit risk is the non-agency CMO portfolio. As of June 30, 2009, the Company concluded that approximately $359.0 million of these securities were other-than-temporarily impaired as a result of deterioration in the expected credit performance of the underlying loans in the securities. These securities were written down to their estimated fair value by recording $199.8 million other-than-temporary impairment, of which $170.1 million was recorded as the noncredit portion of OTTI in other comprehensive loss (before tax) during the three months ended June 30, 2009. The Company recognized $29.7 million and $48.5 million net impairment for the three and six months ended June 30, 2009. The Company recognized net impairment of $17.2 million and $43.8 million for non-agency CMO securities for the three and six months ended June 30, 2008.  The Company’s intent not to sell or belief that the Company will not be required to sell these securities in an unrealized loss position at June 30, 2009 until the market value recovers or the securities mature was based on the facts and circumstances that existed as of that date. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (the     70    Table of Contents  “Act”) was signed into law on October 3, 2008. This Act grants the Treasury authority to purchase troubled assets from financial institutions under the TARP. A new administration came into office and a new Treasury Secretary was named. On March 23, 2009, the new administration announced a new “Public-Private Investment Program” to address the problem of troubled real estate-related assets on banks’ balance sheets. Under the program, the Treasury will work with private investors to establish funds that purchase both loans and securities from financial institutions allowing them to cleanse their balance sheets of what are often referred to as “legacy” assets. The Company does not yet know enough about how this program will be implemented and most importantly the Company does not yet know enough about the prices at which banks’ troubled assets would be sold to these funds to determine if it would be of interest to the Company. Therefore the Company cannot make an assessment of whether the Treasury’s plans under the Act will impact the Company’s intent with respect to these securities and its loans in future periods. The Company’s assessment of its intent not to sell or belief that the Company will not be required to sell these securities in an unrealized loss position at June 30, 2009 until the market value recovers or the securities mature was based on these facts.

As of June 30, 2009, the balance of the loans covered by the CDS was $2.6 billion, on which $17.8 million in losses have been recognized. The CDS provides protection for losses in excess of $4.0 million, but not to exceed approximately $30.3 million. During the three months ended June 30, 2009, the Company began to receive cash recoveries from the CDS for amounts reported in excess of the $4.0 million threshold. The Company expects to recognize the remaining benefit over for the next twelve months, which is reflected in the allowance for loan losses as of June 30, 2009.  The Company initiated a loan modification program in 2008 that in its early stages, resulted in an insignificant number of minor modifications. This loan modification program became more active during the first half of 2009. As part of the program, the Company considers modifications in which it made an economic concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty a TDR. The Company has also modified a number of loans through traditional collections actions taken in the normal course of servicing delinquent accounts. These actions typically result in an insignificant delay in the timing of payments; therefore, the Company does not consider such activities to be economic concessions to the borrowers.    72    Table of Contents Included in our allowance for loan losses at June 30, 2009 was a specific allowance of $105.6 million that was established for TDRs. The specific allowance for these individually impaired loans represents the expected loss over the remaining life of the loan, including the economic concession to the borrower. The following table shows detailed information related to the Company’s modified loans accounted for as TDRs as of and for the three and six months June 30, 2009 (dollars in thousands):                     RecordedInvestmentin TDRs (1)   SpecificValuationAllowance   Specific ValuationAllowance as a %of TDR Loans     June 30, 2009               One- to four-family   $ 104,698   $ 19,948   19 %    Home equity     167,276     85,691   51 %                      Total(2)   $ 271,974   $ 105,639   39 %                         (1)    For the three and six months ended June 30, 2009, the average recorded investment in TDR loans was $202.7 million and $159.1 million, respectively, and the interest income recognized on these loans was $1.4 million and $2.0 million, respectively.    (2)    At June 30, 2009, $255.7 million of TDRs had an associated specific valuation allowance and $16.3 million did not have an associated valuation allowance.    73    Table of Contents NOTE 6—ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES  The Company enters into derivative transactions primarily to protect against interest rate risk on the value of certain assets, liabilities and future cash flows. Derivative instruments designated in hedging relationships that mitigate the exposure to the variability in expected future cash flows or other forecasted transactions are considered cash flow hedges. Derivative instruments in hedging relationships that mitigate exposure to changes in the fair value of assets or liabilities are considered fair value hedges. The Company is also required to recognize certain contracts and commitments as derivatives when the characteristics of those contracts and commitments meet the definition of a derivative as promulgated by SFAS No. 133, as amended. Each derivative is recorded on the balance sheet at fair value as a freestanding asset or liability. Cash flow and fair value ineffectiveness is re-measured on a quarterly basis. The following table summarizes the location and fair value amounts of derivative instruments reported in the consolidated balance sheet in accordance with the Company’s adoption of SFAS No. 161 on January 1, 2009 (dollars in thousands):                       Fair Value        Asset(1)   Liability(2)     Net(3)     June 30, 2009                 Derivatives designated as hedging instruments under SFAS No. 133, as amended:                 Interest rate contracts                 Cash flow hedges   $ 79,048   $ (175,114 )    $ (96,066 )    Fair value hedges     13,996     —        13,996     Other derivatives     4,922     —        4,922                             Total derivatives designated as hedging instruments under SFAS No. 133, as amended(4)   $ 97,966   $ (175,114 )    $ (77,148 )                               (1)    Reflected in the other assets line item on the consolidated balance sheet.    (2)    Reflected in the accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities line item on the consolidated balance sheet.    (3)    Represents derivative assets net of derivative liabilities for presentation purposes only.    (4)    There were no derivatives not designated as hedging instruments under SFAS No. 133, as amended as of June 30, 2009.  Cash Flow Hedges  The majority of the Company’s derivative instruments as of June 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008 were designated as cash flow hedges. These hedges, which include a combination of interest rate swaps, forward-starting swaps and purchased options on caps and floors, are used primarily to reduce the variability of future cash flows associated with existing variable-rate liabilities and assets and forecasted issuances of liabilities.  The effective portion of changes in fair value of the derivative instruments that hedge cash flows is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax in the consolidated balance sheet, for both active and terminated hedges. Amounts are then included in net operating interest income as a yield adjustment in the same period the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. The ineffective portion of the change in fair value of the derivative instrument is reported as fair value adjustments of derivative instruments in the gain on loans and securities, net line item in the consolidated statement of loss.  If it becomes probable that a hedged forecasted transaction will not occur, amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to the specific hedging instruments would be reclassified into the gain on loans and securities, net line item in the consolidated statement of loss. If hedge accounting is discontinued because a derivative instrument ceases to be a highly effective hedge; or is sold, terminated or de-designated, amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to the specific hedging instrument continue to be reported in other comprehensive income or loss until the forecasted transaction affects earnings. Derivative instruments no longer in hedging relationships continue to be recorded at fair value with changes in fair value being reported in the gain on loans and securities, net line item in the consolidated statement of loss.    74    Table of Contents The future issuances of liabilities, including repurchase agreements, are largely dependent on the market demand and liquidity in the wholesale borrowings market. As of June 30, 2009, the Company believes the forecasted issuance of all debt in cash flow hedge relationships is probable. However, unexpected changes in market conditions in future periods could impact the ability to issue this debt. The Company believes the forecasted issuance of debt in the form of repurchase agreements is most susceptible to an unexpected change in market conditions.

As of June 30, 2009, the fair value of forward contracts accounted for as cash flow hedges included in the derivative assets line item was $4.9 million.    75    Table of Contents The following table shows: 1) amounts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to derivative instruments accounted for as cash flow hedges; 2) amount of ineffectiveness recorded in earnings related to derivative instruments accounted for as cash flow hedges; 3) the notional amount and fair value of derivatives terminated for the periods presented; and 4) the amortization of terminated interest rate swaps and options included in net operating interest income (dollars in thousands):                            Three Months EndedJune 30,     Six Months EndedJune 30,        2009     2008     2009     2008     Impact on accumulated other comprehensive loss (net of tax):                       Beginning balance   $ (375,290 )    $ (207,987 )    $ (417,489 )    $ (132,223 )    Unrealized gain (loss), net     61,427       58,286       96,809       (19,871 )    Reclassifications into earnings, net     7,912       4,396       14,729       6,789                                       Ending balance   $ (305,951 )    $ (145,305 )    $ (305,951 )    $ (145,305 )                                      Cash flow hedge ineffectiveness(1)(2)   $ 441     $ 710     $ 391     $ 626           Derivatives terminated during the period:                       Notional   $ 300,000     $ 1,500,000     $ 1,090,000     $ 3,090,000     Fair value of net gain (loss) recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss   $ (33,347 )    $ 4,439     $ (128,869 )    $ (71,595 )    Amortization of terminated interest rate swaps and options included in net operating interest income   $ (10,516 )    $ (391 )    $ (19,340 )    $ (1,079 )       (1)    The amount of ineffectiveness recorded in earnings for cash flow hedges is equal to the excess of the cumulative change in the fair value of the actual derivative over the cumulative change in the fair value of a hypothetical derivative which is created to match the exact terms of the underlying instruments being hedged.    (2)    The cash flow hedge ineffectiveness is reflected in the gain on loans and securities, net line item.  During the upcoming twelve months, the Company expects to include a pre-tax amount of approximately $11.5 million of net unrealized gains that are currently reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss in net operating interest income as a yield adjustment in the same periods in which the related items affect earnings. The losses accumulated in other comprehensive loss on the derivative instruments terminated shown in the preceding table will be included in net operating interest income over the periods the related items will affect earnings, ranging from 7 days to approximately 13 years.

Changes in the fair value of the derivatives are recognized currently in the gain on loans and securities, net line item.  Fair value hedges are accounted for by recording the fair value of the derivative instrument and the change in fair value of the asset or liability being hedged on the consolidated balance sheet. To the extent that the hedge is ineffective, the changes in the fair values will not offset and the difference, or hedge ineffectiveness, is reflected in the gain on loans and securities, net line item in the consolidated statement of loss. Cash payments or receipts and related accruals during the reporting period on derivatives included in fair value hedge relationships are recorded as an adjustment to interest income or expense on the hedged item.  Hedge accounting is discontinued for fair value hedges if a derivative instrument ceases to be highly effective as a hedge or if the derivative is sold, terminated or de-designated. If fair value hedge accounting is discontinued, the net gain or loss on the underlying transactions being hedged is amortized to interest expense or interest income over the original forecasted period at the time of de-designation. Changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments after de-designation of fair value hedge accounting are recorded in the gain on loans and securities, net line item in the consolidated statement of loss. For a discontinued fair value hedge, the previously hedged item is no longer adjusted for changes in fair value.

The fair value hedge ineffectiveness is reflected in the gain on loans and securities, net line item.  Liability to Lehman Brothers  Prior to Lehman Brothers’ declaration of bankruptcy in September 2008, E*TRADE Bank was a counterparty to interest rate derivative contracts with a subsidiary of Lehman Brothers. Lehman Brothers’ declaration of bankruptcy triggered an event of default and early termination under E*TRADE Bank’s International Swap Dealers Association Master Agreement. As of the date of the event of default, E*TRADE Bank’s net amount due to the Lehman Brothers subsidiary was approximately $101 million, the majority of which was collateralized by securities held by or on behalf of the Lehman Brothers subsidiary. E*TRADE Bank currently is working with Lehman Brothers in an attempt to resolve the parties’ respective obligations.  Credit Risk  Impact on Fair Value Measurements  Credit risk is an element of the recurring fair value measurements for certain assets and liabilities, including derivative instruments. Credit risk is managed by limiting activity to approved counterparties and setting aggregate exposure limits for each approved counterparty. The Company also monitors collateral requirements on derivative instruments through credit support agreements, which reduce risk by permitting the netting of transactions with the same counterparty upon occurrence of certain events.  The Company considered the impact of credit risk on the fair value measurement for derivative instruments, particularly those in net liability positions to counterparties, to be mitigated by the enforcement of credit support agreements, and the collateral requirements therein. The Company pledged approximately $172.1 million of its mortgage-backed securities as collateral related to its derivative contracts as of June 30, 2009.  The Company’s credit risk analysis for derivative instruments also considered whether the cost to mitigate the credit loss exposure on derivative instruments in net asset positions would have resulted in material adjustments to the valuations. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2009, the consideration of counterparty credit risk did not result in an adjustment to the valuation of the Company’s derivative instruments.  Impact on Liquidity  In the normal course of business, collateral requirements contained in the Company’s derivative instruments are enforced by the Company and its counterparties. Upon enforcement of the collateral requirements, the amount of collateral requested is typically based on the net fair value of all derivative instruments with the     78    Table of Contents  counterparty; that is derivative assets net of derivative liabilities at the counterparty level. If the Company were to be in violation of certain provisions of the derivative instruments, the counterparties to the derivative instruments could request payment or collateralization on derivative instruments. The Company expects such requests would be based on the fair value of derivative assets net of derivative liabilities at the counterparty level. Derivative instruments in net liability positions at the counterparty level was $127.4 million as of June 30, 2009. The fair value of the Company’s mortgage-backed securities pledged as collateral, $172.1 million as of June 30, 2009, exceeded derivative instruments in net liability positions at the counterparty level by $44.7 million.

Senior Notes  All of the Company’s senior notes are currently unsecured and will rank equal in right of payment with all of the Company’s existing and future unsubordinated indebtedness and will rank senior in right of payment to all its existing and future subordinated indebtedness.  Springing Lien Notes  In November 2007, the Company issued an aggregate principal amount of $1.8 billion in 12 1/2% Notes. Interest is payable semi-annually and the notes are non-callable for five years and may then be called by the Company at a premium, which declines over time. The Company has the option to make interest payments on its 12 1 /2% Notes in the form of either cash or additional 12 1/2% Notes through May 2010. During the second quarter of 2009, the Company elected to make its May 2009 interest payment of $128.5 million in the form of additional springing lien notes. The November 2010 payment is the first payment the Company is required to pay in cash.  The indenture for the Company’s 12 1/2% Notes requires the Company to secure the 12 1/2% Notes with the property and assets of the Company and any future subsidiary guarantors (subject to certain exceptions). The requirement to secure the 12 1/2% Notes will occur on the earlier of: 1) the date on which the 8% Notes are redeemed(1) or 2) the first date on which the Company is allowed to grant liens in excess of $300 million under the 8% Notes. The requirement to secure the 12 1/2% Notes is limited to the amount of debt under the 12 1/2% Notes that would not trigger a requirement for the Company to equally and ratably secure the existing 8% Notes, 7 3/8% Notes and the 7 7/8% Notes.      (1)   Assuming completion of the debt exchange offering, approximately $6 million in principal amount of the 8% Notes will remain outstanding immediately following the exchange based upon the aggregate principal amount of 8% Notes tendered as of July 1, 2009.    80    Table of Contents Pending Debt Exchange Offer  In June 2009, the Company launched an offer to exchange approximately $1.7 billion aggregate principal amount of its corporate debt, which included up to $1.3 billion principal amount of the 12 1/2% Notes and all $435.5 million principal amount of the 8% Notes for an equal principal amount of newly-issued non-interest bearing convertible debentures. The pending debt exchange is subject to shareholder and regulatory approval. See Note 15—Subsequent Event for further information regarding the debt exchange.  NOTE 10—SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY  In May 2009, the Company initiated an Equity Drawdown Program to offer and sell up to $150 million of common stock from time to time, in which the Company issued 40.7 million shares of common stock resulting in net proceeds of $63.4 million during the second quarter of 2009. The Equity Drawdown Program was suspended in June 2009. The Company issued 500 million shares of common stock, par value $0.01 in a Public Equity Offering in June 2009. The Public Equity Offering resulted in net proceeds, after commissions, of $522.9 million. Citadel, the Company’s largest stock and debt holder, purchased approximately 90.9 million shares of the Company’s common stock in the Public Equity Offering.

Of the excluded shares, 5.7 million shares and 4.5 million shares were anti-dilutive because of the Company’s net loss for the three and six months ended June 30, 2009, respectively. The Company excluded from the calculations of diluted loss per share 37.8 million shares of stock options and unvested restricted stock awards and units for both the three and six months ended June 30, 2008. Of the excluded shares, 1.2 million and 1.3 million shares were anti-dilutive because of the Company’s net loss for the three and six months ended June 30, 2008, respectively.  NOTE 12—REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS  Registered Broker-Dealers  The Company’s U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to the Uniform Net Capital Rule (the “Rule”) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 administered by the SEC and Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”), which requires the maintenance of minimum net capital. The minimum net capital requirements can be met under either the Aggregate Indebtedness method or the Alternative method. Under the Aggregate Indebtedness method, a broker-dealer is required to maintain minimum net capital of the greater of 6 2/3% of its aggregate indebtedness, as defined, or a minimum dollar amount. Under the Alternative method, a broker-dealer is required to maintain net capital equal to the greater of $250,000 or 2% of aggregate debit balances arising from customer transactions. The method used depends on the individual U.S. broker-dealer subsidiary. The Company’s international broker-dealer subsidiaries, located in Europe and Asia, are subject to capital requirements determined by their respective regulators.  As of June 30, 2009, all of the Company’s broker-dealer subsidiaries met minimum net capital requirements. Total required net capital was $0.1 billion at June 30, 2009. In addition, the Company’s broker-dealer subsidiaries had excess net capital of $0.5 billion at June 30, 2009. Banking  During the second quarter of 2009, E*TRADE Securities LLC became a wholly-owned operating subsidiary of E*TRADE Bank. E*TRADE Securities LLC continues to be an SEC-registered broker-dealer and is included in the minimum net capital requirements under the Rule. E*TRADE Bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can trigger certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on E*TRADE Bank’s financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, E*TRADE Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of E*TRADE Bank’s assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. In addition, E*TRADE Bank may not pay dividends to the parent company without approval from the OTS and any loans by E*TRADE Bank to the parent company and its other non-bank subsidiaries are subject to various quantitative, arm’s length, collateralization and other requirements. E*TRADE Bank’s capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors.  Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require E*TRADE Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of Total and Tier I capital to risk-weighted assets and Tier I capital to adjusted total assets. As shown in the table below, at June 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008, the OTS categorized E*TRADE Bank as “well capitalized” under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. However, events beyond management’s control, such as a continued deterioration in residential real estate and credit markets, could adversely affect future earnings and E*TRADE Bank’s ability to meet its future capital requirements.    82    Table of Contents E*TRADE Bank’s required actual capital amounts and ratios are presented in the table below (dollars in thousands):                              Actual     Minimum Requiredto Qualify asAdequatelyCapitalized     Minimum Required to beWell Capitalized UnderPrompt CorrectiveAction Provisions        Amount   Ratio     Amount   Ratio     Amount   Ratio     June 30, 2009(1) :                           Total capital to risk-weighted assets   $ 3,241,793   13.91 %    >$ 1,864,729   >8.0 %    >$ 2,330,911   >10.0 %    Tier I capital to risk-weighted assets   $ 2,940,281   12.61 %    >$ 932,364   >4.0 %    >$ 1,398,547   > 6.0 %    Tier I capital to adjusted total assets   $ 2,979,166   6.79 %    >$ 1,756,139   >4.0 %    >$ 2,195,173   > 5.0 %    December 31, 2008:                           Total capital to risk-weighted assets   $ 3,136,650   12.95 %    >$ 1,937,583   >8.0 %    >$ 2,421,979   >10.0 %    Tier I capital to risk-weighted assets   $ 2,824,299   11.66 %    >$  968,792   >4.0 %    >$ 1,453,187   > 6.0 %    Tier I capital to adjusted total assets   $ 2,824,299   6.29 %    >$ 1,796,601   >4.0 %    >$ 2,245,751   > 5.0 %       (1)    Capital amounts and ratios include E*TRADE Securities LLC.  NOTE 13—COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENCIES AND OTHER REGULATORY MATTERS  Legal Matters  Litigation Matters  On October 27, 2000, a complaint was filed in the Superior Court for the State of California, County of Santa Clara, entitled, “Ajaxo, Inc., a Delaware corporation, Plaintiff, versus E*TRADE GROUP, INC., a Delaware corporation; and Everypath, Inc., a California corporation; and Does 1 through 50, inclusively, Defendants.” Through this complaint, Ajaxo sought damages and certain non-monetary relief for the Company’s alleged breach of a non-disclosure agreement with Ajaxo pertaining to certain wireless technology offered to the Company by Ajaxo as well as damages and other relief against both the Company and defendant Everypath, Inc., for their alleged misappropriation of Ajaxo’s trade secrets. Following a jury trial, a judgment was entered in 2003 in favor of Ajaxo against the Company for $1.3 million dollars for breach of the Ajaxo non-disclosure agreement. Although the jury also found in favor of Ajaxo on its misappropriation of trade secrets claim against the Company and defendant Everypath, the trial court subsequently denied Ajaxo’s requests for additional damages and relief on these claims. Thereafter, all parties appealed, and on December 21, 2005, the California Court of Appeal affirmed the above-described award against the Company for breach of the nondisclosure agreement but remanded the case to the trial court for the limited purpose of determining what, if any, additional damages Ajaxo may be entitled to as a result of the jury’s previous finding in favor of Ajaxo on its misappropriation of trade secrets claim against the Company and defendant Everypath. Following the foregoing ruling by the Court of Appeal, defendant Everypath ceased operations and made an assignment for the benefit of its creditors in January, 2006. As a result, defendant Everypath is no longer defending the case. Although the Company paid Ajaxo the full amount due on the judgment against it above, the case, consistent with the rulings issued by the Court of Appeal, was remanded back to the trial court, and on May 30, 2008, a jury returned a verdict in favor of E*TRADE denying all claims raised and demands for damages against the Company by Ajaxo. Following the trial court’s filing on September 5, 2008, of entry of judgment in favor of E*TRADE, Ajaxo filed post trial motions asking the trial court to grant a new trial and to vacate its September 5, 2008, entry of judgment in favor of the Company. By order dated November 4, 2008, the trial court denied these motions. On December 2, 2008, Ajaxo filed its notice of appeal with the Court of Appeal of the State of California for the Sixth District. By stipulation, Ajaxo filed its opening appellate brief on July 8, 2009, and the current due date for the Company to file its opposing brief is October 6, 2009. The Company will continue to vigorously defend itself and oppose Ajaxo’s appeal.  On October 2, 2007, a class action complaint alleging violations of the federal securities laws was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against the Company and its then Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer entitled, “Larry Freudenberg, Individually and on Behalf of All     83    Table of Contents  Others Similarly Situated, Plaintiff, versus E*TRADE Financial Corporation, Mitchell H. Caplan and Robert J. Simmons, Defendants.” By order dated July 17, 2008, the trial court consolidated the Freudenberg action with four other purported class actions, all of which were filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York and which were based on the same facts and circumstances as the Freudenberg action. By the same July 17, 2008 order, the trial court appointed the “Kristen-Straxton Group” and Ira Newman co-lead plaintiffs and Brower Piven and Levi & Korsinski, respectively, as lead and co-lead plaintiffs’ counsel. Thereafter, on January 16, 2009, plaintiffs served their “Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint for Violations of the Federal Securities Laws.” In their amended complaint, plaintiffs again name the Company’s former chief executive and financial officers as defendants as well as Dennis Webb, the Company’s former Capital Markets Division President. In their amended complaint, Plaintiffs allege causes of action for violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) and Rule 10b-5 against all defendants and violations of Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act against the individual defendants. In specific, plaintiffs contend, among other things, that the value of E*TRADE’s stock between April 19, 2006 and November 9, 2007 (the “class period”) was artificially inflated because defendants, among other things, issued materially false and misleading statements and failed to disclose that the Company was experiencing a rise in delinquency rates in its mortgage and home equity portfolios; failed to timely record an impairment on its mortgage and home equity portfolios; materially overvalued its securities portfolio, which included assets backed by mortgages; and based on the foregoing, lacked a reasonable basis for the positive statements it made about the Company’s earnings and prospects. Plaintiffs seek to recover damages in an amount to be proven at trial, including interest and attorneys’ fees and costs. By prior order of the court, defendants filed their motion to dismiss on April 2, 2009, and all parties are to complete briefing on defendants’ motion to dismiss by August 31, 2009. The Company intends to vigorously defend itself against these claims.  On August 15, 2008, an action entitled, “Ronald M. Tate, Trustee of the Ronald M. Tate Trust Dtd 4/13/88, and George Avakian, an Individual, Plaintiffs, versus E*TRADE Financial Corporation, Mitchell H. Caplan, an Individual, and Robert J. Simmons, an Individual, Defendants” was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The Tate action is based on the same facts and circumstances, and contains the same claims, as the Freudenberg consolidated actions discussed above. By agreement of the parties and approval of the court, the Tate action has been consolidated with the Freudenberg consolidated actions for the purpose of pre-trial discovery. The Company intends to vigorously defend itself against these claims.  Based upon the same facts and circumstances alleged in the Freudenberg consolidated actions above, a verified shareholder derivative complaint was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on October 4, 2007, against the Company’s then Chief Executive Officer, President/Chief Operating Officer, Chief Financial Officer and individual members of its board of directors entitled, “Catherine Rubery, Derivatively on behalf of E*TRADE Financial Corporation, Plaintiff, versus Mitchell H. Caplan, R. Jarrett Lilien, Robert J. Simmons, George A. Hayter, Daryl Brewster, Ronald D. Fisher, Michael K. Parks, C. Catherine Raffaeli, Lewis E. Randall, Donna L. Weaver, and Stephen H. Willard, Defendants, -and- E*TRADE Financial Corporation, a Delaware corporation, Nominal Defendant.” Plaintiff alleges, among other things, causes of action for breach of fiduciary duty, waste of corporate assets, unjust enrichment, and violation of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder. The above federal shareholder derivative complaint has been consolidated with another shareholder derivative complaint brought in the same court and against the same named defendants entitled, “Marilyn Clark, Derivatively On Behalf of E*TRADE Financial Corporation, Plaintiff, versus Mitchell H. Caplan, et al., Defendants” (collectively, with the Rubery case, the “federal derivative actions”). Three similar derivative actions, based on the same facts and circumstances as the federal derivative actions, but alleging exclusively state causes of action, have been filed in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County. These three state cases have been ordered consolidated in that court under the caption “In re: E*Trade Financial Corporation Derivative Litigation, Lead Index No. 07-603736” (the “state derivative actions”). In these state derivative actions, plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint on March 23, 2009. By agreement of the parties and approval of the respective courts, further proceedings in both these federal and state derivative actions will continue to trail those in the federal securities class actions discussed above.    84    Table of Contents On April 2, 2008, a class action complaint alleging violations of the federal securities laws was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against the Company entitled, “John W. Oughtred, Individually, and on Behalf of all Others Similarly Situated, Plaintiff, v. E*TRADE Financial Corporation and E*TRADE Securities LLC, Defendants.” Plaintiff contends, among other things, that the E*TRADE defendants committed various sales practice violations in the sale of certain auction rate securities to investors between April 2, 2003, and February 13, 2008 (the “class period”) by allegedly misrepresenting that these securities were highly liquid and safe investments for short term investing. On April 17, 2008, the trial court entered an order relieving the defendants of their obligation to move, answer or otherwise respond to the complaint until such time as the court may deem appropriate. Thereafter, plaintiff Oughtred joined plaintiffs in twelve other actions involving auction rate securities (in which the Company is not named as defendant) in filing a motion seeking to centralize all 13 actions in the Southern District of New York or in the alternative, the Northern District of California. By order filed October 9, 2008, a United States Judicial Panel on Multi-District Litigation denied plaintiffs’ motion to transfer. On December 18, 2008, plaintiffs filed their first amended class action complaint, and defendants filed their pending motion to dismiss plaintiffs’ amended complaint on February 5, 2009. Subsequently, plaintiff John Oughtred voluntarily dismissed his class action claims against defendants on March 12, 2009; as a result, Mr. Oughtred no longer is a party to this class action. The Company intends to vigorously defend itself against the claims raised in this action.  On October 11, 2006, a state class action entitled, “Nikki Greenberg, and all those similarly situated, plaintiffs, versus E*TRADE FINANCIAL Corporation, defendant” was filed in the Superior Court for the State of California, County of Los Angeles on behalf of all customers or consumers who allegedly made or received telephone calls from E*TRADE that were recorded without their knowledge or consent following a telephone call from plaintiff Greenberg to the Company’s Beverly Hills financial center on August 8, 2006, that was recorded during a brief period when the Company’s automated notice system was out of order. On February 7, 2008, class certification was granted and the class defined to consist of (1) all persons in California who received telephone calls from E*TRADE and whose calls were recorded without their consent within three years of October 11, 2006, and (2) all persons who made calls from California to the Beverly Hills financial center of the Company on August 8, 2006. In the interim, the Company has filed motions seeking to de-certify or further limit the defined class, and plaintiffs have filed competing motions seeking to expand it. On July 12, 2009, the court entered an order granting preliminary approval to the parties’ proposed settlement and set for hearing on October 16, 2009, the parties’ request for final approval. The hearing of the parties’ pending motions, formerly scheduled for March 6, 2009, has been taken off the calendar.  In addition to the matters described above, the Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the normal course of business which could have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In each pending matter, the Company contests liability or the amount of claimed damages. In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of such matters, particularly in cases where claimants seek substantial or indeterminate damages, or where investigation or discovery have yet to be completed, the Company cannot predict with certainty the loss or range of loss related to such matters, how such matters will be resolved, when they will ultimately be resolved, or what any eventual settlement, fine, penalty or other relief might be. Subject to the foregoing, the Company believes that the outcome of any such pending matter will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition of the Company, although the outcome could be material to the Company’s or a business segment’s operating results in the future, depending, among other things, upon the Company’s or business segment’s income for such period.  An unfavorable outcome in any matter that is not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, even if the ultimate outcomes are resolved in the Company’s favor, the defense of such litigation could entail considerable cost or the diversion of the efforts of management, either of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.    85    Table of Contents Regulatory Matters  The securities and banking industries are subject to extensive regulation under federal, state and applicable international laws. From time to time, the Company has been threatened with or named as a defendant in, lawsuits, arbitrations and administrative claims involving securities, banking and other matters. The Company is also subject to periodic regulatory audits and inspections. Compliance and trading problems that are reported to regulators, such as the SEC, FINRA, OTS or FDIC by dissatisfied customers or others are investigated by such regulators, and may, if pursued, result in formal claims being filed against the Company by customers or disciplinary action being taken against the Company or its employees by regulators. Any such claims or disciplinary actions that are decided against the Company could have a material impact on the financial results of the Company or any of its subsidiaries.  In the second quarter of 2009, the OTS advised the Company, and the Company agreed, that it was necessary to raise additional equity capital for E*TRADE Bank and reduce substantially the amount of the Company’s outstanding debt in order to withstand any further deterioration in current credit and market conditions. Pursuant to a memorandum of understanding the Company has entered into with the OTS, the OTS is requiring the Company to submit to the OTS and implement written plans to address these and related matters.  In March 2009, the Company’s subsidiary E*TRADE Capital Markets, LLC and 13 other current or former specialist firms on various regional exchanges finalized a settlement of SEC charges alleging that such firms executed proprietary orders in a given security prior to a customer order in the same security (a practice commonly known as “trading ahead”) during the period 1999-2005. E*TRADE Capital Markets, LLC was a specialist on the Chicago Stock Exchange during the period under review although it exited the specialist business in 2007. According to the SEC complaint, the majority of the alleged violations occurred between 1999 and 2002. As part of the settlement, E*TRADE Capital Markets, LLC consented to the entry of an injunction from future violations of Chicago Stock Exchange Article 9 Rule 17 and the payment of $28.3 million in disgorgement and a $5.7 million penalty, both of which had been reserved for in prior periods. E*TRADE Capital Markets, LLC also consented to findings that it violated section 17(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17a-3(a)(1) thereunder by failing to make or keep current an itemized record of all purchases and sales in its proprietary account. E*TRADE Capital Markets, LLC settled the SEC charges without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint.  On October 17, 2007, the SEC initiated an informal inquiry into matters related to the Company’s mortgage loan and mortgage-related securities investment portfolios. That inquiry is continuing. The Company is cooperating fully with the SEC in this matter.  Beginning in approximately August 2008, representatives of various states attorneys general and FINRA initiated informal inquiries regarding the purchase of auction rate securities by the Company’s customers. The Company is cooperating with these inquiries.  Insurance  The Company maintains insurance coverage that management believes is reasonable and prudent. The principal insurance coverage it maintains covers commercial general liability; property damage; hardware/software damage; cyber liability; directors and officers; employment practices liability; certain criminal acts against the Company; and errors and omissions. The Company believes that such insurance coverage is adequate for the purpose of its business. The Company’s ability to maintain this level of insurance coverage in the future, however, is subject to the availability of affordable insurance in the marketplace.  Reserves  For all legal matters, reserves are established in accordance with SFAS No. 5. Once established, reserves are adjusted based on available information when an event occurs requiring an adjustment.    86    Table of Contents Commitments  In the normal course of business, the Company makes various commitments to extend credit and incur contingent liabilities that are not reflected in the consolidated balance sheet. Significant changes in the economy or interest rates influence the impact that these commitments and contingencies have on the Company in the future.  Loans  In 2008, the Company exited its direct retail lending business, which was the last remaining loan origination channel of the Company. In March 2009, the Company partnered with a third party company to provide access to real estate loans for our customers. This product is being offered as a convenience to the Company’s customers and is not one of its primary product offerings. The Company structured this arrangement to minimize the assumption of any of the typical risks commonly associated with mortgage lending. The third party company providing this product performs all processing and underwriting of these loans. Shortly after closing, the third party company purchases the loans from the Company and is responsible for the credit risk associated with these loans. As a result, the Company had $47.4 million in commitments to originate loans at June 30, 2009. The Company had $12.6 million in commitments to sell loans and no commitments to purchase loans at June 30, 2009.  Securities, Unused Lines of Credit and Certificates of Deposit  At June 30, 2009, the Company had commitments to purchase $1.0 billion and sell $0.8 billion in securities. In addition, the Company had approximately $1.5 billion of certificates of deposit scheduled to mature in less than one year and $2.2 billion of unfunded commitments to extend credit.  Guarantees  In prior periods when the Company sold loans, the Company provided guarantees to investors purchasing mortgage loans, which are considered standard representations and warranties within the mortgage industry. The primary guarantees are that: the mortgage and the mortgage note have been duly executed and each is the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable in accordance with its terms; the mortgage has been duly acknowledged and recorded and is valid; and the mortgage and the mortgage note are not subject to any right of rescission, set-off, counterclaim or defense, including, without limitation, the defense of usury, and no such right of rescission, set-off, counterclaim or defense has been asserted with respect thereto. The Company is responsible for the guarantees on loans sold. If these claims prove to be untrue, the investor can require the Company to repurchase the loan and return all loan purchase and servicing release premiums.  Management has determined that quantifying the potential liability exposure is not meaningful due to the nature of the standard representations and warranties, which rarely result in loan repurchases.  ETBH raised capital through the formation of trusts, which sold trust preferred stock in the capital markets. The capital securities are mandatorily redeemable in whole at the due date, which is generally 30 years after issuance. Each trust issues Floating Rate Cumulative Preferred Securities at par, with a liquidation amount of $1,000 per capital security. The proceeds from the sale of issuances are invested in ETBH’s Floating Rate Junior Subordinated Debentures.  During the 30-year period prior to the redemption of the Floating Rate Cumulative Preferred Securities, ETBH guarantees the accrued and unpaid distributions on these securities, as well as the redemption price of the securities and certain costs that may be incurred in liquidating, terminating or dissolving the trusts (all of which would otherwise be payable by the trusts). At June 30, 2009, management estimated that the maximum potential liability under this arrangement is equal to approximately $436.9 million or the total face value of these securities plus dividends, which may be unpaid at the termination of the trust arrangement.    87    Table of Contents NOTE 14—SEGMENT INFORMATION  Beginning in the first quarter of 2009, the Company revised its segment financial reporting to reflect the manner in which its chief operating decision maker had begun assessing the Company’s performance and making resource allocation decisions. As a result, the Company now reports its operating results in two segments: 1) “Trading and Investing,” which includes the businesses that were formerly in the “Retail” segment and now includes the Company’s market making business, and 2) “Balance Sheet Management,” which includes the businesses from the former “Institutional” segment, other than the market-making business. The Company’s segment financial information from prior periods has been reclassified in accordance with the new segment financial reporting.  Trading and investing includes:        •    brokerage and related asset gathering products and services;        •    investor-focused banking products and services;        •    market-making; and        •    stock plan administration products and services.  Balance sheet management includes:        •    managing loans previously originated or purchased from third parties; and        •    leveraging these loans and customer cash and deposit relationships.  The Company evaluates the performance of its segments based on segment contribution (net revenue less provision for loan losses and operating expense).

NOTE 15—SUBSEQUENT EVENT  On July 1, 2009, the Company announced the results of the early tender period of the pending debt exchange offer. Approximately $1.3 billion and $429.6 million of the 12 1/2% Notes and 8% Notes, respectively, had been irrevocably tendered and accepted for exchange. The pending debt exchange offer is subject to shareholder and regulatory approval.  On August 4, 2009, the OTS approved Citadel’s application to amend its Rebuttal of Control Agreement pertaining to the Company. This approval satisfies the regulatory approval requirements for the pending debt exchange offer. Therefore, the pending debt exchange offer is now subject only to shareholder approval.    92    Table of Contents   ITEM 4.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS  On October 27, 2000, a complaint was filed in the Superior Court for the State of California, County of Santa Clara, entitled, “Ajaxo, Inc., a Delaware corporation, Plaintiff, versus E*TRADE GROUP, INC., a Delaware corporation; and Everypath, Inc., a California corporation; and Does 1 through 50, inclusively, Defendants.” Through this complaint, Ajaxo sought damages and certain non-monetary relief for the Company’s alleged breach of a non-disclosure agreement with Ajaxo pertaining to certain wireless technology offered to the Company by Ajaxo as well as damages and other relief against both the Company and defendant Everypath, Inc., for their alleged misappropriation of Ajaxo’s trade secrets. Following a jury trial, a judgment was entered in 2003 in favor of Ajaxo against the Company for $1.3 million dollars for breach of the Ajaxo non-disclosure agreement. Although the jury also found in favor of Ajaxo on its misappropriation of trade secrets claim against the Company and defendant Everypath, the trial court subsequently denied Ajaxo’s requests for additional damages and relief on these claims. Thereafter, all parties appealed, and on December 21, 2005, the California Court of Appeal affirmed the above-described award against the Company for breach of the nondisclosure agreement but remanded the case to the trial court for the limited purpose of determining what, if any, additional damages Ajaxo may be entitled to as a result of the jury’s previous finding in favor of Ajaxo on its misappropriation of trade secrets claim against the Company and defendant Everypath. Following the foregoing ruling by the Court of Appeal, defendant Everypath ceased operations and made an assignment for the benefit of its creditors in January, 2006. As a result, defendant Everypath is no longer defending the case. Although the Company paid Ajaxo the full amount due on the judgment against it above, the case, consistent with the rulings issued by the Court of Appeal, was remanded back to the trial court, and on May 30, 2008, a jury returned a verdict in favor of E*TRADE denying all claims raised and demands for damages against the Company by Ajaxo. Following the trial court’s filing on September 5, 2008, of entry of judgment in favor of E*TRADE, Ajaxo filed post trial motions asking the trial court to grant a new trial and to vacate its September 5, 2008, entry of judgment in favor of the Company. By order dated November 4, 2008, the trial court denied these motions. On December 2, 2008, Ajaxo filed its notice of appeal with the Court of Appeal of the State of California for the Sixth District. By stipulation, Ajaxo filed its opening appellate brief on July 8, 2009, and the current due date for the Company to file its opposing brief is October 6, 2009. The Company will continue to vigorously defend itself and oppose Ajaxo’s appeal.  On October 2, 2007, a class action complaint alleging violations of the federal securities laws was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against the Company and its then Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer entitled, “Larry Freudenberg, Individually and on Behalf of All Others Similarly Situated, Plaintiff, versus E*TRADE Financial Corporation, Mitchell H. Caplan and Robert J. Simmons, Defendants.” By order dated July 17, 2008, the trial court consolidated the Freudenberg action with four other purported class actions, all of which were filed in the United States District Court for the Southern     93    Table of Contents  District of New York and which were based on the same facts and circumstances as the Freudenberg action. By the same July 17, 2008 order, the trial court appointed the “Kristen-Straxton Group” and Ira Newman co-lead plaintiffs and Brower Piven and Levi & Korsinski, respectively, as lead and co-lead plaintiffs’ counsel. Thereafter, on January 16, 2009, plaintiffs served their “Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint for Violations of the Federal Securities Laws.” In their amended complaint, plaintiffs again name the Company’s former chief executive and financial officers as defendants as well as Dennis Webb, the Company’s former Capital Markets Division President. In their amended complaint, Plaintiffs allege causes of action for violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) and Rule 10b-5 against all defendants and violations of Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act against the individual defendants. In specific, plaintiffs contend, among other things, that the value of E*TRADE’s stock between April 19, 2006 and November 9, 2007 (the “class period”) was artificially inflated because defendants, among other things, issued materially false and misleading statements and failed to disclose that the Company was experiencing a rise in delinquency rates in its mortgage and home equity portfolios; failed to timely record an impairment on its mortgage and home equity portfolios; materially overvalued its securities portfolio, which included assets backed by mortgages; and based on the foregoing, lacked a reasonable basis for the positive statements it made about the Company’s earnings and prospects. Plaintiffs seek to recover damages in an amount to be proven at trial, including interest and attorneys’ fees and costs. By prior order of the court, defendants filed their motion to dismiss on April 2, 2009, and all parties are to complete briefing on defendants’ motion to dismiss by August 31, 2009. The Company intends to vigorously defend itself against these claims.  On August 15, 2008, an action entitled, “Ronald M. Tate, Trustee of the Ronald M. Tate Trust Dtd 4/13/88, and George Avakian, an Individual, Plaintiffs, versus E*TRADE Financial Corporation, Mitchell H. Caplan, an Individual, and Robert J. Simmons, an Individual, Defendants” was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The Tate action is based on the same facts and circumstances, and contains the same claims, as the Freudenberg consolidated actions discussed above. By agreement of the parties and approval of the court, the Tate action has been consolidated with the Freudenberg consolidated actions for the purpose of pre-trial discovery. The Company intends to vigorously defend itself against these claims.  Based upon the same facts and circumstances alleged in the Freudenberg consolidated actions above, a verified shareholder derivative complaint was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on October 4, 2007, against the Company’s then Chief Executive Officer, President/Chief Operating Officer, Chief Financial Officer and individual members of its board of directors entitled, “Catherine Rubery, Derivatively on behalf of E*TRADE Financial Corporation, Plaintiff, versus Mitchell H. Caplan, R. Jarrett Lilien, Robert J. Simmons, George A. Hayter, Daryl Brewster, Ronald D. Fisher, Michael K. Parks, C. Catherine Raffaeli, Lewis E. Randall, Donna L. Weaver, and Stephen H. Willard, Defendants, -and- E*TRADE Financial Corporation, a Delaware corporation, Nominal Defendant.” Plaintiff alleges, among other things, causes of action for breach of fiduciary duty, waste of corporate assets, unjust enrichment, and violation of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder. The above federal shareholder derivative complaint has been consolidated with another shareholder derivative complaint brought in the same court and against the same named defendants entitled, “Marilyn Clark, Derivatively On Behalf of E*TRADE Financial Corporation, Plaintiff, versus Mitchell H. Caplan, et al., Defendants” (collectively, with the Rubery case, the “federal derivative actions”). Three similar derivative actions, based on the same facts and circumstances as the federal derivative actions, but alleging exclusively state causes of action, have been filed in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County. These three state cases have been ordered consolidated in that court under the caption “In re: E*Trade Financial Corporation Derivative Litigation, Lead Index No. 07-603736” (the “state derivative actions”). In these state derivative actions, plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint on March 23, 2009. By agreement of the parties and approval of the respective courts, further proceedings in both these federal and state derivative actions will continue to trail those in the federal securities class actions discussed above.  On April 2, 2008, a class action complaint alleging violations of the federal securities laws was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against the Company entitled, “John W. Oughtred, Individually, and on Behalf of all Others Similarly Situated, Plaintiff, v. E*TRADE Financial     94    Table of Contents  Corporation and E*TRADE Securities LLC, Defendants.” Plaintiff contends, among other things, that the E*TRADE defendants committed various sales practice violations in the sale of certain auction rate securities to investors between April 2, 2003, and February 13, 2008 (the “class period”) by allegedly misrepresenting that these securities were highly liquid and safe investments for short term investing. On April 17, 2008, the trial court entered an order relieving the defendants of their obligation to move, answer or otherwise respond to the complaint until such time as the court may deem appropriate. Thereafter, plaintiff Oughtred joined plaintiffs in twelve other actions involving auction rate securities (in which the Company is not named as defendant) in filing a motion seeking to centralize all 13 actions in the Southern District of New York or in the alternative, the Northern District of California. By order filed October 9, 2008, a United States Judicial Panel on Multi-District Litigation denied plaintiffs’ motion to transfer. On December 18, 2008, plaintiffs filed their first amended class action complaint, and defendants filed their pending motion to dismiss plaintiffs’ amended complaint on February 5, 2009. Subsequently, plaintiff John Oughtred voluntarily dismissed his class action claims against defendants on March 12, 2009; as a result, Mr. Oughtred no longer is a party to this class action. The Company intends to vigorously defend itself against the claims raised in this action.  On October 11, 2006, a state class action entitled, “Nikki Greenberg, and all those similarly situated, plaintiffs, versus E*TRADE FINANCIAL Corporation, defendant” was filed in the Superior Court for the State of California, County of Los Angeles on behalf of all customers or consumers who allegedly made or received telephone calls from E*TRADE that were recorded without their knowledge or consent following a telephone call from plaintiff Greenberg to the Company’s Beverly Hills financial center on August 8, 2006, that was recorded during a brief period when the Company’s automated notice system was out of order. On February 7, 2008, class certification was granted and the class defined to consist of (1) all persons in California who received telephone calls from E*TRADE and whose calls were recorded without their consent within three years of October 11, 2006, and (2) all persons who made calls from California to the Beverly Hills financial center of the Company on August 8, 2006. In the interim, the Company has filed motions seeking to de-certify or further limit the defined class, and plaintiffs have filed competing motions seeking to expand it. On July 12, 2009, the court entered an order granting preliminary approval to the parties’ proposed settlement and set for hearing on October 16, 2009, the parties’ request for final approval. The hearing of the parties’ pending motions, formerly scheduled for March 6, 2009, has been taken off the calendar.  In addition to the matters described above, the Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the normal course of business which could have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In each pending matter, the Company contests liability or the amount of claimed damages. In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of such matters, particularly in cases where claimants seek substantial or indeterminate damages, or where investigation or discovery have yet to be completed, the Company cannot predict with certainty the loss or range of loss related to such matters, how such matters will be resolved, when they will ultimately be resolved, or what any eventual settlement, fine, penalty or other relief might be. Subject to the foregoing, the Company believes that the outcome of any such pending matter will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition of the Company, although the outcome could be material to the Company’s or a business segment’s operating results in the future, depending, among other things, upon the Company’s or business segment’s income for such period.  In March 2009, the Company’s subsidiary E*TRADE Capital Markets, LLC and 13 other current or former specialist firms on various regional exchanges finalized a settlement of SEC charges alleging that such firms executed proprietary orders in a given security prior to a customer order in the same security (a practice commonly known as “trading ahead”) during the period 1999-2005. E*TRADE Capital Markets, LLC was a specialist on the Chicago Stock Exchange during the period under review although it exited the specialist business in 2007. According to the SEC complaint, the majority of the alleged violations occurred between 1999 and 2002. As part of the settlement, E*TRADE Capital Markets, LLC consented to the entry of an injunction from future violations of Chicago Stock Exchange Article 9 Rule 17 and the payment of $28.3 million in disgorgement and a $5.7 million penalty, both of which had been reserved for in prior periods. E*TRADE Capital Markets, LLC also consented to findings that it violated section 17(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of     95    Table of Contents  1934 and Rule 17a-3(a)(1) thereunder by failing to make or keep current an itemized record of all purchases and sales in its proprietary account. E*TRADE Capital Markets, LLC settled the SEC charges without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint.  On October 17, 2007, the SEC initiated an informal inquiry into matters related to the Company’s mortgage loan and mortgage-related securities investment portfolios. That inquiry is continuing. The Company is cooperating fully with the SEC in this matter.  Beginning in approximately August 2008, representatives of various states attorneys general and FINRA initiated informal inquiries regarding the purchase of auction rate securities by the Company’s customers. The Company is cooperating with these inquiries.  An unfavorable outcome in any matter that is not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, even if the ultimate outcomes are resolved in the Company’s favor, the defense of such litigation could entail considerable cost or the diversion of the efforts of management, either of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.  The Company maintains insurance coverage that management believes is reasonable and prudent. The principal insurance coverage it maintains covers commercial general liability; property damage; hardware/software damage; cyber liability; directors and officers; employment practices liability; certain criminal acts against the Company; and errors and omissions. The Company believes that such insurance coverage is adequate for the purpose of its business. The Company’s ability to maintain this level of insurance coverage in the future, however, is subject to the availability of affordable insurance in the marketplace.      ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS  The Company incorporates by reference the sections entitled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to an Investment in Our Company” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Nature and Operation of Our Business” from page S-8 through page S-14 and from page S-23 through page S-27 of the Prospectus Supplement dated July 2, 2009 into this report. In addition, the risk factor presented below should be considered in addition to the risks described above and all of the risk factors previously disclosed in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008.  We could as a result of the debt exchange and the Public Equity Offering, or as a result of future transactions, experience an “ownership change” for tax purposes that could cause us to permanently lose a significant portion of our U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets.  The debt exchange and the Public Equity Offering could cause us to experience an “ownership change” as defined for U.S. federal income tax purposes (which is generally a greater than 50 percentage point increase by certain “5% shareholders” over a rolling three year period). Even if these transactions do not cause us to experience an “ownership change,” these transactions materially increase the risk that we could experience an “ownership change” in the future. As a result, issuances or sales of common stock or other securities in the future (including common stock issued on conversion of the convertible debentures issued pursuant to the debt exchange and any debt-for-equity exchanges), or certain other direct or indirect changes in ownership, could result in an “ownership change” under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. In the event an “ownership change” were to occur, we could realize a permanent loss of a significant portion of our U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets and lose certain built-in losses that have not been recognized for tax purposes. The amount of the permanent loss would depend on the size of the annual limitation (which is in part a function of our market capitalization at the time of an “ownership change”) and the remaining carryforward period (U.S. federal net operating losses generally may be carried forward for a period of 20 years).   96    Table of Contents If an “ownership change” had occurred on August 6, 2009, we estimate we would have permanently lost the ability to realize up to $0.8 billion of our net deferred tax asset. The resulting loss would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. This could also decrease E*TRADE Bank’s regulatory capital. We do not believe, however, that any such decrease in regulatory capital would be material because, among other things, only a small portion of the federal deferred tax asset is currently included in E*TRADE Bank’s regulatory capital.
