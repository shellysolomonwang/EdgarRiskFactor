Item 1A. Risk Factors.  Credit Risk Management  Our primary sources of credit risk are our loan and securities portfolios, where risk results from extending credit to customers and purchasing securities, respectively. The degree of credit risk associated with our loans and securities varies based on many factors including the size of the transaction, the credit characteristics of the borrower, features of the loan product or security, the contractual terms of the related documents and the availability and quality of collateral. Credit risk is one of the most common risks in financial services and is one of our most significant risks.  Credit risk is monitored by our Credit Risk Committee. The Credit Risk Committee uses detailed tracking and analysis to measure credit performance and reviews and modifies credit policies as appropriate.  Loss Mitigation  We have a credit management team that focuses on the mitigation of potential losses in the loan portfolio. Through a variety of strategies, including voluntary line closures, automatically freezing lines on all delinquent accounts, and freezing lines on loans with materially reduced home equity, we have reduced our exposure to open home equity lines from a high of over $7 billion in 2007 to $0.8 billion as of March 31, 2010.  We also have an active loan modification program that focuses on the mitigation of potential losses in the loan portfolio. We consider modifications in which we made an economic concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty a troubled debt restructuring (“TDR”). As of March 31, 2010, we had modified $710.9 million of loans in which the modification was considered a TDR. We also modified a number of loans through    27    Table of Contents  traditional collections actions taken in the normal course of servicing delinquent accounts. These actions typically result in an insignificant delay in the timing of payments; therefore, the Company does not consider such activities to be economic concessions to the borrowers.  The team has several other initiatives either in progress or in development which are focused on mitigating losses in our loan portfolio. Those initiatives include improving collection efforts and practices of our servicers as well as increasing our loss recovery efforts to minimize the level of loss on a loan that goes to charge-off.  In addition, we continue to review our mortgage loan portfolio in order to identify loans to be repurchased by the originator. Our review is primarily focused on identifying loans with violations of transaction representations and warranties or material misrepresentation on the part of the seller. Any loans identified with these deficiencies are submitted to the original seller for repurchase. Approximately $7.0 million and $74.4 million of loans were repurchased by the original sellers for the three months ended March 31, 2010 and the year ended December 31, 2009, respectively.  Underwriting Standards—Originated Loans  We provide access to real estate loans for our customers through a third party company. This product is being offered as a convenience to our customers and is not one of our primary product offerings. We structured this arrangement to minimize our assumption of any of the typical risks commonly associated with mortgage lending. The third party company providing this product performs all processing and underwriting of these loans. Shortly after closing, the third party company purchases the loans from us and is responsible for the credit risk associated with these loans. We originated $28.7 million in loans during the three months ended March 31, 2010 and we had commitments to originate mortgage loans of $36.7 million at March 31, 2010.  CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK  Loans  We track and review many factors to predict and monitor credit risk in our loan portfolio, which is primarily made up of loans secured by residential real estate. These factors, which are documented at the time of origination, include: borrowers’ debt-to-income ratio, borrowers’ credit scores, housing prices, documentation type, occupancy type and loan type. We also review estimated current loan-to-value (“LTV”) ratios when monitoring credit risk in our loan portfolios. In economic conditions in which housing prices generally appreciate, we believe that loan type, LTV ratios and credit scores are the key factors in determining future loan performance. In the current housing market with declining home prices and less credit available for refinance, we believe the LTV ratio becomes a more important factor in predicting and monitoring credit risk.  We believe certain categories of loans inherently have a higher level of credit risk due to characteristics of the borrower and/or features of the loan. Two of these categories are sub-prime and option adjustable rate mortgages (“ARM”) loans. As a general matter, we did not originate or purchase these loans to hold on our balance sheet; however, in the normal course of purchasing large pools of real estate loans, we invariably ended up acquiring a de minimis amount of sub-prime loans. As of March 31, 2010, we held no option ARM loans.  As noted above, we believe loan type, LTV ratios and borrowers’ credit scores are key determinants of future loan performance. Our home equity loan portfolio is primarily second lien loans(1) on residential real estate properties, which have a higher level of credit risk than first lien mortgage loans. We believe home equity loans with a combined loan-to-value (“CLTV”) of 90% or higher or a Fair Isaac Credit Organization (“FICO”) score below 700 are the loans with the highest levels of credit risk in our portfolios.      (1)   Approximately 13% of the home equity portfolio is in the first lien position.    28    Table of Contents The breakdowns by current LTV/CLTV and FICO score of our two main loan portfolios, one-to four-family and home equity, are as follows (dollars in millions):                            One- to Four-Family     Home Equity     Current LTV/CLTV(1)   March 31,2010     December 31,2009     March 31,2010     December 31,2009     <=70%   $ 1,769.8     $ 2,095.3     $ 1,358.0     $ 1,379.6     70% - 80%     1,087.8       1,148.2       477.5       507.6     80% - 90%     1,368.4       1,464.2       670.3       705.6     90% - 100%     1,399.4       1,500.9       846.6       885.9     >100%     4,127.2       4,358.5       4,069.9       4,291.0                                       Total   $ 9,752.6     $ 10,567.1     $ 7,422.3     $ 7,769.7                                       Average estimated current LTV/CLTV(2)     98.4 %      97.3 %      105.3 %      106.0 %    Average LTV/CLTV at loan origination(3)     70.4 %      70.1 %      80.1 %      79.5 %      (1)    Current CLTV calculations for home equity loans are based on the maximum available line for home equity lines of credit and outstanding principal balance for home equity installment loans.

The current FICO distribution as of March 31, 2010 included original FICO scores for approximately $379 million and $475 million of one- to four-family and home equity loans, respectively. The current FICO distribution as of December 31, 2009 included original FICO scores for approximately $365 million and $847 million of one- to four-family and home equity loans, respectively.

No other state had concentrations of real estate loans that represented 10% or more of the Company’s real estate portfolio.  Allowance for Loan Losses  The allowance for loan losses is management’s estimate of credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date. The estimate of the allowance for loan losses is based on a variety of quantitative and qualitative factors, including the composition and quality of the portfolio; delinquency levels and trends; current and historical charge-off and loss experience; current industry charge-off and loss experience; our historical loss mitigation experience; the condition of the real estate market and geographic concentrations within the loan portfolio; the interest rate climate; the overall availability of housing credit; and general economic conditions. The allowance for loan losses is typically equal to management’s estimate of loan charge-offs in the twelve months following the balance sheet date as well as the estimated charge-offs, including economic concessions to borrowers, over the estimated remaining life of loans modified in TDRs. Determining the adequacy of the allowance is complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Subsequent evaluations of the loan portfolio, in light of the factors then prevailing, may result in significant changes in the allowance for loan losses in future periods. We believe our allowance for loan losses at March 31, 2010 is representative of probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date.  The general allowance for loan losses also included a specific qualitative component to account for environmental factors that we believe will impact our level of credit losses. This qualitative component, which was applied by loan type, reflects our estimate of credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio due to environmental factors which are not directly considered in our quantitative loss model but are factors we believe will have an impact on credit losses (e.g. the current level of unemployment).  In determining the allowance for loan losses, we allocate a portion of the allowance to various loan products based on an analysis of individual loans and pools of loans. However, the entire allowance is available to absorb credit losses inherent in the total loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date.    30    Table of Contents The following table presents the allowance for loan losses by major loan category (dollars in millions):                                    One- to Four-Family     Home Equity     Consumer and Other     Total        Allowance   Allowanceas a %of LoansReceivable(1)     Allowance   Allowanceas a %of LoansReceivable(1)     Allowance   Allowanceas a %of LoansReceivable(1)     Allowance   Allowanceas a %of LoansReceivable(1)     March 31, 2010   $ 433.9   4.43 %    $ 657.2   8.73 %    $ 71.3   4.00 %    $ 1,162.4   6.09 %    December 31, 2009   $ 489.9   4.62 %    $ 620.0   7.87 %    $ 72.8   3.90 %    $ 1,182.7   5.81 %      (1)    Allowance as a percentage of loans receivable is calculated based on the gross loans receivable for each respective category.  During the three months ended March 31, 2010, the allowance for loan losses decreased by $20.3 million from the level at December 31, 2009. This decrease was driven primarily by the decrease in the allowance allocated to the one- to four-family loan portfolio, which began to deteriorate during 2008, offset by an increase in the allowance allocated to the home equity loan portfolio, which began to deteriorate during the second half of 2007. We believe the deterioration in both of these portfolios was caused by several factors, including: home price depreciation in key markets; growing inventories of unsold homes; rising foreclosure rates; sustained contraction in the availability of credit; and a general decline in economic growth. In addition, the combined impact of home price depreciation and the reduction of available credit made it increasingly difficult for borrowers to refinance existing loans. Although we expect these factors will cause the provision for loan losses to continue at elevated levels in future periods, the level of provision for loan losses has declined for six consecutive quarters. While we cannot state with certainty that this trend will continue, we believe it is a positive indicator that our loan portfolio has continued to stabilize. Included in our allowance for loan losses at March 31, 2010 was a specific allowance of $231.0 million that was established for TDRs. The specific allowance for these individually impaired loans represents the expected loss, including the economic concession to the borrower, over the remaining life of the loan. The following table shows the TDRs and specific valuation allowance by loan portfolio as of March 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009 (dollars in millions):                     RecordedInvestmentin TDRs   SpecificValuationAllowance   Specific ValuationAllowance as a %of TDR Loans     March 31, 2010             One- to four-family   $ 283.5   $ 34.5   12 %    Home equity     427.4     196.5   46 %                      Total   $ 710.9   $ 231.0   32 %                      December 31, 2009             One- to four-family   $ 207.6   $ 26.9   13 %    Home equity     371.3     166.7   45 %                      Total   $ 578.9   $ 193.6   33 %                    The recorded investment in TDRs includes the charge-offs related to certain loans that were written down to the estimated current property value less costs to sell. These charge-offs were recorded primarily on loans that were delinquent in excess of 180 days prior to the loan modification. The total expected loss on TDRs, which includes both previously recorded charge-offs and the specific valuation allowance, as a percentage of TDRs, was 21% and 49% for our one- to four-family and home equity loan portfolios, respectively, as of March 31, 2010.    31    Table of Contents The following table shows the TDRs by delinquency category as of March 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009 (dollars in millions):                        TDRsCurrent   TDRs30-89 DaysDelinquent    TDRs90+ DaysDelinquent    TotalRecorded Investment inTDRs   March 31, 2010               One- to four-family   $ 170.2   $ 54.9   $ 58.4   $ 283.5   Home equity     335.4     56.8     35.2     427.4                             Total   $ 505.6   $ 111.7   $ 93.6   $ 710.9                             December 31, 2009               One- to four-family   $ 128.5   $ 34.6   $ 44.5   $ 207.6   Home equity     304.1     41.5     25.7     371.3                             Total   $ 432.6   $ 76.1   $ 70.2   $ 578.9                           The following table provides an analysis of the net charge-offs for the three months ended March 31, 2010 and 2009 (dollars in millions):                          Charge-offs     Recoveries   Net Charge-offs     % ofAverage Loans(Annualized)     Three months ended March 31, 2010                     One- to four-family   $ (102.6 )    $ —    $ (102.6 )    4.00 %    Home equity     (176.7 )      6.5     (170.2 )    8.69 %    Consumer and other     (23.1 )      7.6     (15.5 )    3.39 %                                Total   $ (302.4 )    $ 14.1   $ (288.3 )    5.79 %                                Three months ended March 31, 2009                     One- to four-family   $ (67.0 )    $ —    $ (67.0 )    2.10 %    Home equity     (247.8 )      2.5     (245.3 )    9.79 %    Consumer and other     (28.2 )      6.7     (21.5 )    3.77 %                                Total   $ (343.0 )    $ 9.2   $ (333.8 )    5.32 %                              Loan losses are recognized when it is probable that a loss will be incurred. Our policy for both one- to four-family and home equity loans is to assess the value of the property when the loan has been delinquent for 180 days or is in bankruptcy, regardless of whether or not the property is in foreclosure, and charge-off the amount of the loan balance in excess of the estimated current property value less costs to sell. Our policy is to charge-off credit cards when collection is not probable or the loan has been delinquent for 180 days and to charge-off closed-end consumer loans when the loan is 120 days delinquent or when we determine that collection is not probable.    32    Table of Contents Net charge-offs for the three months ended March 31, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 decreased by $45.5 million. The overall decrease was due primarily to lower net charge-offs on our home equity loans, offset by higher net charge-offs on our one- to four-family loans. We believe net charge-offs will decline in future periods when compared to the level of charge-offs in the three months ended March 31, 2010 as a result of our decline in special mention delinquencies, which is discussed below. The following graph illustrates the net charge-offs by quarter:     Nonperforming Assets  We classify loans as nonperforming when they are 90 days past due. The following table shows the comparative data for nonperforming loans and assets (dollars in millions):                    March 31,2010     December 31,2009     One- to four-family   $ 1,220.3     $ 1,229.7     Home equity     225.8       250.6     Consumer and other     6.0       6.7                       Total nonperforming loans     1,452.1       1,487.0     Real estate owned (“REO”) and other repossessed assets, net     131.9       115.7                       Total nonperforming assets, net   $ 1,584.0     $ 1,602.7                       Nonperforming loans receivable as a percentage of gross loans receivable     7.60 %      7.31 %    One- to four-family allowance for loan losses as a percentage of one- to four-family nonperforming loans     35.55 %      39.84 %    Home equity allowance for loan losses as a percentage of home equity nonperforming loans     290.97 %      247.46 %    Consumer and other allowance for loan losses as a percentage of consumer and other nonperforming loans     1188.33 %      1082.29 %    Total allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total nonperforming loans     80.05 %      79.54 %  During the three months ended March 31, 2010, our nonperforming assets, net decreased $18.7 million to $1.6 billion when compared to December 31, 2009. The decrease was attributed primarily to a decrease in    33    Table of Contents  nonperforming one- to four-family loans of $9.4 million and home equity loans of $24.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2010 when compared to December 31, 2009. These decreases were slightly offset by an increase of $16.2 million in REO and other repossessed assets, net for the three months ended March 31, 2010.  The following graph illustrates the nonperforming loans by quarter:     The allowance as a percentage of total nonperforming loans receivable, net increased from 79.54% at December 31, 2009 to 80.05% at March 31, 2010. This slight increase was driven by a decrease in both our one- to four-family and home equity nonperforming loans. The balance of nonperforming loans includes loans delinquent 90 to 179 days as well as loans delinquent 180 days and greater. We believe the distinction between these two periods is important as loans delinquent 180 days and greater have been written down to their expected recovery value, whereas loans delinquent 90 to 179 days have not. We believe loans delinquent 90 to 179 days is an important measure because these loans are expected to drive the vast majority of future charge-offs. Additional charge-offs on loans delinquent 180 days are possible if home prices decline beyond our current expectations, but we do not anticipate these charge-offs to be significant, particularly when compared to the expected charge-offs on loans delinquent 90 to 179 days. We expect the balances of one- to four-family loans delinquent 180 days and greater to increase in the future due to the extensive amount of time it takes to foreclose on a property in the current real estate market.    34    Table of Contents The following graph shows the loans delinquent 90 to 179 days for each of our major loan categories:     In addition to nonperforming assets, we monitor loans where a borrower’s past credit history casts doubt on their ability to repay a loan (“special mention” loans). We classify loans as special mention when they are between 30 and 89 days past due. The following table shows the comparative data for special mention loans (dollars in millions):                    March 31,2010     December 31,2009     One- to four-family   $ 526.6     $ 527.9     Home equity     214.0       246.2     Consumer and other loans     28.0       30.4                       Total special mention loans   $ 768.6     $ 804.5                       Special mention loans receivable as a percentage of gross loans receivable     4.03 %      3.95 %  The trend in special mention loan balances are generally indicative of the expected trend for charge-offs in future periods, as these loans have a greater propensity to migrate into nonaccrual status and ultimately charge-off. One- to four-family loans are generally secured in a first lien position by real estate assets, reducing the potential loss when compared to an unsecured loan. Our home equity loans are generally secured by real estate assets; however, the majority of these loans are secured in a second lien position, which substantially increases the potential loss when compared to a first lien position.  During the three months ended March 31, 2010, special mention loans decreased by $35.9 million to $768.6 million. This decrease was largely due to a decrease in home equity special mention loans. The decrease in home equity special mention loans includes the impact of our loan modification programs in which borrowers who were 30 to 89 days past due were made current(1) . While our level of special mention loans can fluctuate significantly in any given period, we believe the continued decrease we observed in recent quarters is an encouraging sign regarding the future credit performance of this portfolio.      (1)   Loans modified as TDRs are accounted for as nonaccrual loans at the time of modification and return to accrual status after six consecutive payments are made in accordance with the modified terms.    35    Table of Contents The following graph illustrates the special mention loans by quarter:     Securities  We focus primarily on security type and credit rating to monitor credit risk in our securities portfolios. We believe our highest concentration of credit risk within this portfolio is the non-agency CMO portfolio. The table below details the amortized cost by average credit ratings and type of asset as of March 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009 (dollars in millions):                           March 31, 2010   AAA   AA   A   BBB   BelowInvestmentGrade andNon-Rated   Total   Agency mortgage-backed securities and CMOs   $ 8,409.5   $ —    $ —    $ —    $ —    $ 8,409.5   U.S. Treasury securities and agency debentures     4,199.7     —      —      —      —      4,199.7   Non-agency CMOs and other     42.0     57.7     122.5     9.3     332.8     564.3   Municipal bonds, corporate bonds and FHLB stock     214.5     9.4     8.0     —      19.9     251.8   Other agency debt securities     183.0     —      —      —      —      183.0                                         Total   $ 13,048.7   $ 67.1   $ 130.5   $ 9.3   $ 352.7   $ 13,608.3                                                 December 31, 2009   AAA   AA   A   BBB   BelowInvestmentGrade andNon-Rated   Total   Agency mortgage-backed securities and CMOs   $ 8,946.0   $ —    $ —    $ —    $ —    $ 8,946.0   Agency debentures     3,928.9     —      —      —      —      3,928.9   Non-agency CMOs and other     43.6     60.2     129.6     17.2     339.6     590.2   Municipal bonds, corporate bonds and FHLB stock     214.4     9.5     7.9     —      19.9     251.7                                         Total   $ 13,132.9   $ 69.7   $ 137.5   $ 17.2   $ 359.5   $ 13,716.8                                       While the vast majority of this portfolio is AAA-rated, we concluded during the three months ended March 31, 2010 that approximately $263.1 million of the non-agency CMOs in this portfolio were other-than-temporarily impaired. As a result of the deterioration in the expected credit performance of the underlying loans in the securities, they were written down by recording $8.6 million of net impairment during the first quarter of    36    Table of Contents  2010. Further declines in the performance of our non-agency CMO portfolio could result in additional impairments in future periods.  SUMMARY OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  The preparation of our financial condition and results of operations requires us to make judgments and estimates that may have a significant impact upon the financial results of the Company. We believe that of our significant accounting policies, the following require estimates and assumptions that require complex, subjective judgments by management, which can materially impact reported results: allowance for loan losses; fair value measurements; classification and valuation of certain investments; accounting for derivative instruments; estimates of effective tax rates, deferred taxes and valuation allowances; valuation of goodwill and other intangibles; and valuation and expensing of share-based payments. These are more fully described in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009, as amended by a Current Report on Form 8-K filed concurrently on May 5, 2010.    37    Table of Contents GLOSSARY OF TERMS  Active accounts—Accounts with a balance of $25 or more or a trade in the last six months.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  The following discussion about our market risk disclosure includes forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including, but not limited to, those set forth in Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009. Market risk is our exposure to changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and equity and commodity prices. Our exposure to interest rate risk is related primarily to interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.  Interest Rate Risk  The management of interest rate risk is essential to profitability. Interest rate risk is our exposure to changes in interest rates. In general, we manage our interest rate risk by balancing variable-rate and fixed-rate assets and liabilities and we utilize derivatives in a way that reduces our overall exposure to changes in interest rates. In recent years, we have managed our interest rate risk to achieve a minimum to moderate risk profile with limited exposure to earnings volatility resulting from interest rate fluctuations. Exposure to interest rate risk requires management to make complex assumptions regarding maturities, market interest rates and customer behavior. Changes in interest rates, including the following, could impact interest income and expense:        •    Interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities may re-price at different times or by different amounts creating a mismatch.        •    The yield curve may flatten or change shape affecting the spread between short- and long-term rates. Widening or narrowing spreads could impact net interest income.        •    Market interest rates may influence prepayments resulting in maturity mismatches. In addition, prepayments could impact yields as premium and discounts amortize.  Exposure to market risk is dependent upon the distribution and composition of interest-earning assets, interest-bearing liabilities and derivatives. The differing risk characteristics of each product are managed to mitigate our exposure to interest rate fluctuations. At March 31, 2010, 91% of our total assets were enterprise interest-earning assets.  At March 31, 2010, approximately 57% of our total assets were residential real estate loans and available-for-sale mortgage-backed securities. The values of these assets are sensitive to changes in interest rates, as well as expected prepayment levels. As interest rates increase, fixed rate residential mortgages and mortgage-backed securities tend to exhibit lower prepayments. The inverse is true in a falling rate environment.  When real estate loans prepay, unamortized premiums are written off. Depending on the timing of the prepayment, the write-offs of unamortized premiums may result in lower than anticipated yields. The Asset Liability Committee (“ALCO”) reviews estimates of the impact of changing market rates on prepayments. This information is incorporated into our interest rate risk management strategy.  Our liability structure consists of two central sources of funding: deposits and wholesale borrowings. Cash provided to us through deposits is the primary source of our funding. Our key deposit products include sweep accounts, complete savings accounts and other money market and savings accounts. Our wholesale borrowings include securities sold under agreements to repurchase and FHLB advances. Customer payables, which represents customer cash contained within our broker-dealers, is an additional source of funding. In addition, the parent company has issued a significant amount of corporate debt.  Our deposit accounts and customer payables tend to be less rate-sensitive than wholesale borrowings. Agreements to repurchase securities re-price as interest rates change. Sweep accounts, complete savings accounts and other money market and savings accounts re-price at management’s discretion. FHLB advances and corporate debt generally have fixed rates.    43    Table of Contents Derivative Instruments  We use derivative instruments to help manage our interest rate risk. Interest rate swaps involve the exchange of fixed-rate and variable-rate interest payments between two parties based on a contractual underlying notional amount, but do not involve the exchange of the underlying notional amounts. Option products are utilized primarily to decrease the market value changes resulting from the prepayment dynamics of the mortgage portfolio, as well as to protect against increases in funding costs. The types of options employed include Cap Options (“Caps”) and Floor Options (“Floors”). Caps mitigate the market risk associated with increases in interest rates while Floors mitigate the risk associated with decreases in market interest rates. See derivative instruments discussion at Note 7—Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities in Item 1. Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited).  Scenario Analysis  Scenario analysis is an advanced approach to estimating interest rate risk exposure. Under the NPVE approach, the present value of all existing assets, liabilities, derivatives and forward commitments are estimated and then combined to produce a NPVE figure. The sensitivity of this value to changes in interest rates is then determined by applying alternative interest rate scenarios, which include, but are not limited to, instantaneous parallel shifts up 100, 200 and 300 basis points and down 100 basis points. The NPVE method is used at the E*TRADE Bank level and not for the Company. E*TRADE Bank had 97% of our enterprise interest-earning assets at both March 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, and held 97% of our enterprise interest-bearing liabilities at both March 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009. The sensitivity of NPVE at March 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009 and the limits established by E*TRADE Bank’s Board of Directors are listed below (dollars in millions):                             Change in NPVE           Parallel Change in Interest Rates (basis points)(1)   March 31, 2010     December 31, 2009            Amount     Percentage     Amount     Percentage     Board Limit    +300   $ 49.0     1 %    $ (453.6 )    (14 )%    (55 )%   +200   $ 78.3     2 %    $ (276.6 )    (9 )%    (30 )%   +100   $ 82.4     3 %    $ (89.2 )    (3 )%    (20 )%   -100   $ (260.8 )    (8 )%    $ (110.5 )    (3 )%    (20 )%      (1)    On March 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, the yield on the three-month Treasury bill was 0.16% and 0.06%, respectively. As a result, the OTS temporarily modified the requirements of the NPV Model, resulting in removal of the minus 200 and 300 basis points scenarios for the periods ended March 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009.  Under criteria published by the OTS, E*TRADE Bank’s overall interest rate risk exposure at March 31, 2010 was characterized as “minimum.” We actively manage our interest rate risk positions. As interest rates change, we will re-adjust our strategy and mix of assets, liabilities and derivatives to optimize our position.

The Company also evaluates its continuing involvement with certain entities to determine if the Company is required to consolidate the entities under the variable interest entity model. This evaluation is based on a qualitative assessment of whether the Company has both: 1) the power to direct matters that most significantly impact the activities of the variable interest entity; and 2) the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the variable interest entity that could potentially be significant to the variable interest entity.  Certain prior period items in these consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. These consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, which are all normal and recurring in nature, necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented.  The Company reports corporate interest income and corporate interest expense separately from operating interest income and operating interest expense. The Company believes reporting these two items separately provides a clearer picture of the financial performance of the Company’s operations than would a presentation that combined these two items. Operating interest income and operating interest expense is generated from the operations of the Company. Corporate debt, which is the primary source of the corporate interest expense, has been issued primarily in connection with recapitalization transactions and past acquisitions, such as Harrisdirect and BrownCo.  Similarly, the Company reports gains (losses) on sales of investments, net separately from gains on loans and securities, net. The Company believes reporting these two items separately provides a clearer picture of the financial performance of its operations than would a presentation that combined these two items. Gains on loans and securities, net are the result of activities in the Company’s operations, namely its balance sheet management segment. Gains (losses) on sales of investments, net relate to historical equity investments of the Company at the corporate level and are not related to the ongoing business of the Company’s operating subsidiaries.  Use of Estimates—The consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with GAAP, which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and related notes for the periods presented. Actual results could differ from management’s estimates. Material estimates in which management believes near-term changes could reasonably occur include allowance for loan losses; fair value measurements; classification and valuation of certain investments; accounting for derivative instruments; estimates of effective tax rates, deferred taxes and valuation allowances; valuation of goodwill and other intangibles; and valuation and expensing of share-based payments.  Financial Statement Descriptions and Related Accounting Policies—Financial statement descriptions and related accounting policies are more fully described in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data in    51    Table of Contents  the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009, as amended by a Current Report on Form 8-K filed concurrently on May 5, 2010.  Margin Receivables—The fair value of securities that the Company received as collateral in connection with margin receivables and stock borrowing activities, where the Company is permitted to sell or re-pledge the securities, was approximately $5.5 billion and $5.3 billion as of March 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, respectively. Of this amount, $1.1 billion and $0.9 billion had been pledged or sold in connection with securities loans, bank borrowings and deposits with clearing organizations as of March 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, respectively.  New Accounting and Disclosure Guidance—Below is the new accounting and disclosure guidance that relates to activities in which the Company is engaged.  Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assets  In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) amended the derecognition provisions in the accounting guidance for transfers and servicing, including the removal of the concept of qualifying special-purpose entities (“QSPEs”). The Company’s adoption of the amended derecognition provisions to transfers of financial assets, which did not impact its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, will be applied to transfers of financial assets occurring on or after January 1, 2010.  Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities  In June 2009, the FASB amended the accounting and disclosure guidance for the consolidation of variable interest entities. The amended accounting guidance requires the reconsideration of previous conclusions related to the consolidation of variable interest entities, including whether an entity is a variable interest entity and whether the Company is the variable interest entity’s primary beneficiary. The amended accounting guidance carries forward the scope of the previous accounting guidance for the consolidation of variable interest entities with the addition of entities previously considered QSPEs. The amended accounting and disclosure guidance became effective January 1, 2010 for the Company. The Company’s reconsideration of previous conclusions related to the consolidation of variable interest entities did not result in the consolidation of additional entities as of January 1, 2010. Beginning on January 1, 2010, the Company’s assessment of whether it is a variable interest entity’s primary beneficiary will be ongoing and will consider changes in facts and circumstances related to the variable interest entities.  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures–Improving Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements  In January 2010, the FASB amended the disclosure guidance related to fair value measurements. The amended disclosure guidance requires new fair value measurement disclosures and clarifies existing fair value measurement disclosure requirements. The amended disclosure guidance related to disclosures about purchases, sales, issuances and settlements of Level 3 instruments will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2010, or January 1, 2011 for the Company. The Company’s disclosures about fair value measurements will reflect the adoption of the amended disclosure guidance related to disclosures about purchases, sales, issuances and settlements of Level 3 instruments in the first quarter of 2011. The remaining amended disclosure guidance became effective January 1, 2010 for the Company. The Company’s disclosures about fair value measurements reflect the adoption of the remaining disclosure guidance in Note 4—Fair Value Disclosures.  Derivatives and Hedging–Scope Exception Related To Embedded Credit Derivatives  In March 2010, the FASB amended the accounting guidance for derivatives and hedging to clarify the type of embedded credit derivative that is exempt from embedded derivative bifurcation requirements. An embedded    52    Table of Contents  credit derivative that is related only to the subordination of one financial instrument to another qualifies for the exemption. As a result, entities that have contracts containing an embedded credit derivative feature in a form other than such subordination may need to separately account for the embedded credit derivative feature. The amended accounting guidance will be effective at the beginning of the first fiscal quarter beginning after June 15, 2010, or July 1, 2010 for the Company. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the amended accounting guidance but does not expect the adoption to have a material impact on its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows in future periods.  NOTE 2—FACILITY RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER EXIT ACTIVITIES   The following table summarizes the expense recognized by the Company as facility restructuring and other exit activities for the periods presented (dollars in thousands):                    Three MonthsEnded March 31,        2010     2009     International brokerage business   $ 3,645     $ —      Other exit activities     (272 )      (112 )                      Total facility restructuring and other exit activities   $ 3,373     $ (112 )                    Exit of Non-Core Operations  International Brokerage Business  In the fourth quarter of 2009, the Company decided to restructure its international brokerage business, which provided trading products and services through two primary channels: 1) cross-border trading, where customers residing outside of the U.S. trade in U.S. securities; and 2) local market trading, where customers residing outside of the U.S. trade in non-U.S. securities. The Company believes the local market trading is not a key strategic component of its global brokerage product offering and therefore decided to exit this channel. This exit does not qualify for discontinued operations accounting as the Company will have significant continuing involvement in the international brokerage business with cross-border trading.  The Company entered into agreements to sell the local market trading operations in Germany, the Nordic region and the United Kingdom. The sale of the local market trading operations in Germany was completed in December 2009 and the Company closed the sale of the local market trading operations in the Nordic region and United Kingdom in April 2010.    53    Table of Contents As of March 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, the local market trading operations in Nordic and UK were considered held-for-sale. Below is a table summarizing the carrying amounts of the major classes of assets and liabilities of these operations as of March 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009 (dollars in thousands):                  March 31,2010   December 31,2009   Assets           Cash and equivalents   $ 206,192   $ 226,060   Cash and investments required to be segregated under federal or other regulations     119,415     141,082   Margin receivables     75,745     83,131   Property and equipment, net     3,750     3,461   Other assets     19,746     19,286                 Total assets   $ 424,848   $ 473,020                 Liabilities           Customer payables   $ 389,064   $ 440,606   Accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities     7,782     8,741                 Total liabilities   $ 396,846   $ 449,347               As a result of the international brokerage business restructuring, the Company recognized $3.6 million in expense during the three months ended March 31, 2010, including $2.8 million in severance costs and $0.8 million in asset write-off costs. The Company expects the total charges for this restructuring to be up to $25 million, $19.3 million of which had been incurred as of March 31, 2010.  Facility restructuring and other exit activities expenses are not allocated to the Company’s operating segments but are reported as a component of the “Corporate/Other” category within the Company’s segment information.  NOTE 3—OPERATING INTEREST INCOME AND OPERATING INTEREST EXPENSE  The following table shows the components of operating interest income and operating interest expense (dollars in thousands):                    Three Months EndedMarch 31,         2010     2009     Operating interest income:             Loans, net   $ 241,580     $ 313,328     Mortgage-backed and investment securities     109,293       127,069     Margin receivables     44,713       26,937     Other     11,380       19,303                       Total operating interest income     406,966       486,637                       Operating interest expense:             Deposits     (19,960 )      (97,014 )    Securities sold under agreements to repurchase     (34,746 )      (61,169 )    FHLB advances and other borrowings     (29,428 )      (46,110 )    Other     (2,435 )      (3,682 )                      Total operating interest expense     (86,569 )      (207,975 )                      Net operating interest income   $ 320,397     $ 278,662                       54    Table of Contents NOTE 4—FAIR VALUE DISCLOSURES  Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In determining fair value, the Company may use various valuation approaches, including market, income and/or cost approaches. The fair value hierarchy requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Fair value is a market-based measure considered from the perspective of a market participant. Accordingly, even when market assumptions are not readily available, the Company’s own assumptions reflect those that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. The fair value measurement accounting guidance describes the following three levels used to classify fair value measurements:        •    Level 1—Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.        •    Level 2—Quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly.        •    Level 3—Unobservable inputs that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.  The availability of observable inputs can vary and in certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, the level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The Company’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to a fair value measurement requires judgment and consideration of factors specific to the asset or liability.  Recurring Fair Value Measurement Techniques  U.S. Treasury Securities and Agency Debentures  The fair value measurements of U.S. Treasury securities are classified as Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy as they are based on quoted market prices in active markets. The fair value measurements of agency debentures are classified as Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy as they are based on quoted market prices that can be derived from assumptions observable in the marketplace.  Residential Mortgage-backed Securities  The Company’s residential mortgage-backed securities portfolio is comprised of agency mortgage-backed securities and CMOs, which represent the majority of the portfolio, and non-agency CMOs. As agency mortgage-backed securities and CMOs are guaranteed by U.S. government sponsored and federal agencies, these securities were AAA-rated as of March 31, 2010. The majority of the Company’s non-agency CMOs are backed by first lien mortgages and were below investment grade or non-rated as of March 31, 2010. The following table represents additional information about the residential mortgage-backed securities portfolio as of March 31, 2010:                 Weighted AverageCoupon Rate     Weighted AverageContractualMaturity (Years)   Agency mortgage-backed securities   4.17 %    26   Agency CMOs   4.66 %    24   Non-agency CMOs   4.44 %    26 The fair value of agency mortgage-backed securities is determined using market and income approaches with quoted market prices, recent market transactions and spread data for similar instruments. The fair value of agency CMOs is determined using market and income approaches with the Company’s own trading activities for identical or similar instruments. Agency mortgage-backed securities and CMOs are generally categorized in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.    55    Table of Contents Non-agency CMOs are valued using market and income approaches with market observable data, including recent market transactions when available. The Company also utilized a pricing service to corroborate the market observability of the Company’s inputs used in the fair value measurements. The valuations of non-agency CMOs reflect the Company’s best estimate of what market participants would consider in pricing the financial instruments. The following table presents additional information about the underlying loans and significant inputs for the valuation of non-agency CMOs as of March 31, 2010:                 WeightedAverage     Range   Underlying loans:          Coupon rate   4.79 %    2.45% - 7.04%   Maturity (years)   25     13 – 27   Significant inputs:          Yield   4 %    2% - 10%   Default rate   43 %    2% - 100%   Loss severity   46 %    7% - 86%   Prepayment rate   10 %    0% - 33% The Company considers the price transparency for these financial instruments to be a key determinant of the degree of judgment involved in determining the fair value. As of March 31, 2010, the majority of the Company’s non-agency CMOs were categorized in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.  Other Debt Securities  The fair value measurement of other agency debt securities is determined using market and income approaches with the Company’s own trading activities for identical instruments and is generally categorized in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The Company’s municipal bonds are revenue bonds issued by state and other local government agencies. The valuation of corporate bonds is impacted by the credit worthiness of the corporate issuer. The majority of the Company’s municipal bonds and corporate bonds were rated investment grade as of March 31, 2010. These securities are valued using a market approach with pricing service valuations corroborated by recent market transactions for similar or identical bonds. Municipal bonds and corporate bonds are generally categorized in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.  Derivative Instruments  The majority of the Company’s derivative instruments, interest rate swap and option contracts, are valued with an income approach using pricing models that are commonly used by the financial services industry. The market observable inputs used in the pricing models include the swap curve, the volatility surface and prime basis from a financial data provider. The Company does not consider these models to involve significant judgment on the part of management and corroborated the fair value measurements with counterparty valuations. The Company’s derivative instruments are generally categorized in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The consideration of credit risk, the Company’s or the counterparty’s, did not result in an adjustment to the valuation of its derivative instruments in the periods presented.  Securities Owned and Securities Sold, Not Yet Purchased  Securities transactions entered into by a broker-dealer subsidiary are included in trading securities and securities sold, not yet purchased in the Company’s fair value disclosures. For equity securities, the Company’s definition of actively traded is based on average daily volume and other market trading statistics. The fair value of securities owned and securities sold, not yet purchased is determined using listed or quoted market prices and are categorized in Level 1 or Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.    56    Table of Contents Recurring Fair Value Measurements  Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below (dollars in thousands):                        Level 1   Level 2   Level 3   Fair Value   March 31, 2010:                   Assets                   Trading securities   $ 39,895   $ 6,254   $ 898   $ 47,047   Available-for-sale securities:                   Residential mortgage-backed securities:                   Agency mortgage-backed securities and CMOs     —      8,449,816     —      8,449,816   Non-agency CMOs and other     —      138,431     233,130     371,561                             Total residential mortgage-backed securities     —      8,588,247     233,130     8,821,377                             Investment securities:                   Debt securities:                   U.S. Treasury securities and agency debentures     245,859     3,971,000     —      4,216,859   Other agency debt securities     —      181,399     —      181,399   Municipal bonds     —      39,563     —      39,563   Corporate bonds     —      18,305     —      18,305                             Total debt securities     245,859     4,210,267     —      4,456,126   Publicly traded equity securities:                   Corporate investments     —      696     164     860                             Total investment securities     245,859     4,210,963     164     4,456,986                             Total available-for-sale securities     245,859     12,799,210     233,294     13,278,363                             Other assets:                   Derivative assets(1)     —      84,909     —      84,909   Deposits with clearing organizations(2)     34,999     —      —      34,999                             Total other assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis     34,999     84,909     —      119,908                             Total assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis(3)   $ 320,753   $ 12,890,373   $ 234,192   $ 13,445,318                             Liabilities                   Derivative liabilities(1)   $ —    $ 37,118   $ —    $ 37,118   Securities sold, not yet purchased     35,853     3,745     —      39,598                             Total liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis(3)   $ 35,853   $ 40,863   $ —    $ 76,716                               (1)    All derivative assets and liabilities are interest rate contracts.

Level 3 Assets and Liabilities  Level 3 assets and liabilities included instruments whose value is determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation. While the Company’s fair value estimates of Level 3 instruments utilized observable inputs where available, the valuation included significant management judgment in determining the relevance and reliability of market information considered and the financial instruments were therefore classified as Level 3.  The Company’s transfers of certain CMOs in and out of Level 3 are generally driven by changes in price transparency for the securities. Financial instruments for which actively quoted prices or pricing parameters are    59    Table of Contents  available will have a higher degree of price transparency than financial instruments that are thinly traded or not quoted. As of March 31, 2010, less than 1% of the Company’s total assets and none of its total liabilities represented instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis categorized as Level 3.  Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements  The Company measures certain other assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis: 1) one- to four-family and home equity loans in which the amount of the loan balance in excess of the estimated current property value less costs to sell has been charged-off; and 2) real estate acquired through foreclosure that is carried at the lower of the property’s carrying value or fair value, less estimated selling costs. The following table presents the losses associated with the assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis during the three months ended March 31, 2010 and 2009 and still held on the consolidated balance sheet as of the periods presented (dollars in thousands):                        Carrying Value   Losses      As ofMarch 31,   Three Months EndedMarch 31,       2010   2009(1)   2010   2009(1)   Loans receivable:                   One- to four-family    $ 457,603     N/A   $ 91,240     N/A   Home equity     23,817     N/A     31,715     N/A                         Total loans receivable(2)   $ 481,420   $ 287,106   $ 122,955   $ 99,336                         REO(3)    $ 91,280   $ 58,069   $ 10,977   $ 14,872     (1)    As the amended fair value measurement disclosure guidance was not adopted by the Company until January 1, 2010, certain disclosures are excluded for periods presented prior to the adoption date.    (2)    The fair value measurements of one- to four-family and home equity loans, regardless of whether or not the loans were held on the consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2010, resulted in $95.9 million of one- to four-family loan charge-offs and $37.6 million of home equity loan charge-offs for the three months ended March 31, 2010. The fair value measurements of one-to four-family and home equity loans, regardless of whether or not the loans were held on the consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2009, resulted in charge-offs totaling $107.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2009.    (3)    The fair value measurements of REO, regardless of whether or not the REO was held on the consolidated balance sheet as of the period presented, resulted in net losses totaling $12.1 million and $15.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.  Property valuations are based on the most recent property value data available, which may include appraisals, prices for identical or similar properties, broker price opinions or home price indices. These fair value measurements were classified as Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy as the majority of the valuations included Level 3 inputs that were significant to the estimate of fair value.  Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments  The fair value measurements accounting guidance also requires the disclosure of the fair value of financial instruments not otherwise disclosed above. Different market assumptions and estimation methodologies could significantly affect fair value amounts. The fair value of financial instruments, not otherwise disclosed above, whose fair value approximates carrying value is summarized as follows:        •    Cash and equivalents, cash required to be segregated, margin receivables and customer payables—Fair value is estimated to be carrying value.        •    Investment in FHLB stock—FHLB stock is carried at cost, which is considered to be a reasonable estimate of fair value.    60    Table of Contents The fair value of financial instruments whose fair values were different from their carrying values is summarized below (dollars in thousands):                        March 31, 2010   December 31, 2009      CarryingValue   Fair Value   CarryingValue   Fair Value  Assets                   Loans, net(1)   $ 18,187,958   $ 17,232,443   $ 19,174,933   $ 18,439,112        Liabilities                   Deposits   $ 24,632,882   $ 24,657,684   $ 25,597,721   $ 25,620,950   Securities sold under agreements to repurchase   $ 6,385,272   $ 6,460,490   $ 6,441,875   $ 6,518,762   FHLB advances and other borrowings   $ 2,748,438   $ 2,591,702   $ 2,746,959   $ 2,562,228   Corporate debt   $ 2,400,437   $ 3,279,519   $ 2,458,691   $ 3,390,734     (1)    The carrying value of loans, net includes the allowance for loan losses of $1.2 billion as of both March 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009.        •    Loans, net—For the held-for-investment portfolio, including one- to four-family, home equity, and consumer and other loans, fair value is estimated by differentiating loans based on their individual portfolio characteristics, such as product classification, loan category, pricing features and remaining maturity. Management adjusts assumptions for expected losses, prepayments and discount rates to reflect the individual characteristics of the loans, such as credit risk, coupon, term, and payment characteristics, as well as the secondary market conditions for these types of loans. For loans held-for-sale that were originated through, but not yet purchased by, a third party company, fair value is estimated using third party commitments to purchase loans. For loans held-for-sale that the Company plans to securitize, fair value is estimated at the anticipated pool level using prices based on the pending securitization.        •    Deposits—For sweep deposit accounts, complete savings accounts, other money market and savings accounts and checking accounts, fair value is the amount payable on demand at the reporting date. For certificates of deposit and brokered certificates of deposit, fair value is estimated by discounting future cash flows at the rates currently offered for deposits of similar remaining maturities.        •    Securities sold under agreements to repurchase—Fair value is determined by discounting future cash flows at the rate implied for other similar instruments with similar remaining maturities.        •    FHLB advances and other borrowings—For FHLB advances, fair value is estimated by discounting future cash flows at the rates currently offered for borrowings of similar remaining maturities. For subordinated debentures, fair value is estimated by discounting future cash flows at the rate implied by dealer pricing quotes. For margin collateral, overnight and other short-term borrowings and collateralized borrowings, fair value approximates carrying value.        •    Corporate debt—Fair value is estimated using dealer pricing quotes. The fair value of the non-interest-bearing convertible debentures is directly correlated to the intrinsic value of the Company’s underlying stock. As the price of the Company’s stock increases relative to the conversion price, the fair value of the convertible debentures increases.    61    Table of Contents NOTE 5—AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE

Company adopted the amended guidance for the recognition and presentation of OTTI for debt securities. The Company assessed whether it intends to sell, or whether it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell a security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. For debt    63    Table of Contents  securities that are considered other-than-temporarily impaired and that the Company does not intend to sell and will not be required to sell prior to recovery of its amortized cost basis, the Company determines the amount of the impairment that is related to credit and the amount due to all other factors. The credit loss component is the difference between the security’s amortized cost basis and the present value of its expected future cash flows and is recognized in earnings. The noncredit loss component is the difference between the present value of its expected future cash flows and the fair value and is recognized through other comprehensive income.  The Company does not believe that any individual unrealized loss in the available-for-sale portfolio as of March 31, 2010 represents a credit related impairment. The majority of the unrealized losses on mortgage-backed securities are attributable to changes in interest rates and a re-pricing of risk in the market. All agency mortgage-backed securities and CMOs and U.S. Treasury securities and agency debentures are AAA-rated. Municipal bonds and corporate bonds are evaluated by reviewing the credit-worthiness of the issuer and general market conditions. The Company does not intend to sell the securities in an unrealized loss position and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the debt securities before the anticipated recovery of its remaining amortized cost of the securities in an unrealized loss position at March 31, 2010.  The majority of the Company’s available-for-sale portfolio consists of residential mortgage-backed securities. For residential mortgage-backed securities, the Company calculates the credit portion of OTTI by comparing the present value of the expected future cash flows with the amortized cost basis of the security. The expected future cash flows are determined using the remaining contractual cash flows adjusted for future credit losses. The estimate of expected future credit losses includes the following assumptions: 1) expected default rates based on current delinquency trends, foreclosure statistics of the underlying mortgages and loan documentation type; 2) expected loss severity based on the underlying loan characteristics, including loan-to-value, origination vintage and geography; and 3) expected loan prepayments and principal reduction based on current experience and existing market conditions that may impact the future rate of prepayments. The expected cash flows of the security are then discounted at the interest rate used to recognize interest income on the security to arrive at the present value amount. The following table presents a summary of the significant inputs considered for securities that were other-than-temporarily impaired as of March 31, 2010:                March 31, 2010      Weighted Average   Range   Default rate(1)   8%    1% - 40%   Loss severity   45%   40% - 65%   Prepayment rate   11%   6% - 45%     (1)    Represents the expected default rate for the next twelve months.

The Company recognized $8.6 million in net impairment for non-agency CMO securities for the three months ended March 31, 2010. The Company concluded that approximately $263.1 million of non-agency CMO securities were other-than-temporarily impaired as a result of deterioration in the expected credit performance of the underlying loans in the securities. For the three months ended March 31, 2010, these securities were written down to their fair value by recording gross OTTI of $14.5 million, of which $5.9 million was recorded as the noncredit portion of OTTI through other comprehensive income (before tax). For the three months ended March 31, 2009, the Company recognized net impairment of $18.8 million on non-agency CMO securities.

The Company plans to securitize these loans with Fannie Mae during the second quarter of 2010. For the foreseeable future, the Company does not plan to securitize or sell any of its remaining one- to four-family loans in the held-for-investment portfolio.  The Company has an active loan modification program that focuses on the mitigation of potential losses in the loan portfolio. As part of the program, the Company considers modifications in which it made an economic concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty a TDR. The Company has also modified a number of loans through traditional collections actions taken in the normal course of servicing delinquent accounts. These actions typically result in an insignificant delay in the timing of payments; therefore, the Company does not consider such activities to be economic concessions to the borrowers.  Included in the allowance for loan losses at March 31, 2010 was a specific allowance of $231.0 million that was established for TDRs. The specific allowance for these individually impaired loans represents the expected loss over the remaining life of the loan, including the economic concession to the borrower. The average recorded investment in TDR loans was $669.3 million and $115.5 million and the interest income recognized on these loans was $3.5 million and $0.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

Derivative instruments designated in hedging relationships that mitigate exposure to the variability in expected future cash flows or other forecasted transactions are considered cash flow hedges. Derivative instruments in hedging relationships that mitigate exposure to changes in the fair value of assets or liabilities are considered fair value hedges. The Company also recognizes certain contracts and commitments as derivatives when the characteristics of those contracts and commitments meet the definition of a derivative. Each derivative is recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value as a freestanding asset or liability. Cash flow and fair value hedge ineffectiveness is re-measured on a quarterly basis. The following table summarizes the location and fair value amounts of derivative instruments reported in the consolidated balance sheet (dollars in thousands):                       Fair Value        Asset(1)   Liability(2)     Net(3)     March 31, 2010                 Derivatives designated as hedging instruments:                 Interest rate contracts:                 Cash flow hedges   $ 77,713   $ (37,118 )    $ 40,595     Fair value hedges     7,196     —        7,196                             Total derivatives designated as hedging instruments(4)   $ 84,909   $ (37,118 )    $ 47,791                             December 31, 2009                 Derivatives designated as hedging instruments:                 Interest rate contracts:                 Cash flow hedges   $ 87,534   $ (143,602 )    $ (56,068 )    Fair value hedges     5,863     —        5,863                             Total derivatives designated as hedging instruments(4)   $ 93,397   $ (143,602 )    $ (50,205 )                              (1)    Reflected in the other assets line item on the consolidated balance sheet.

(3)    Represents derivative assets net of derivative liabilities for presentation purposes only.    (4)    There were no derivatives not designated as hedging instruments as of March 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009.  Cash Flow Hedges  The majority of the Company’s derivative instruments as of March 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009 were designated as cash flow hedges. These hedges, which include a combination of interest rate swaps, forward-starting swaps and purchased options, including caps and floors, are used primarily to reduce the variability of future cash flows associated with existing variable-rate assets and liabilities and forecasted issuances of liabilities.  The effective portion of changes in fair value of the derivative instruments that hedge cash flows is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax in the consolidated balance sheet, for both active and terminated hedges. Amounts are then included in net operating interest income as a yield adjustment in the same period the hedged transaction affects earnings. The ineffective portion of changes in fair value of the derivative instruments is reported as a fair value adjustment in the gains on loans and securities, net line item in the consolidated statement of loss.  If it becomes probable that a hedged forecasted transaction will not occur, amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to the specific hedging instruments are reclassified into the gains on loans and securities, net line item in the consolidated statement of loss. If hedge accounting is discontinued because a derivative instrument ceases to be a highly effective hedge; or is sold, terminated or de-designated, amounts    67    Table of Contents  included in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to the specific hedging instrument continue to be reported in other comprehensive income or loss until the forecasted transaction affects earnings. Derivative instruments no longer in hedging relationships continue to be recorded at fair value with changes in fair value reported in the gains on loans and securities, net line item in the consolidated statement of loss.  The future issuances of liabilities, including repurchase agreements, are largely dependent on the market demand and liquidity in the wholesale borrowings market. As of March 31, 2010, the Company believes the forecasted issuance of all debt in cash flow hedge relationships is probable. However, unexpected changes in market conditions in future periods could impact the ability to issue this debt. The Company believes the forecasted issuance of debt in the form of repurchase agreements is most susceptible to an unexpected change in market conditions.

During the upcoming twelve months, the Company expects to include a pre-tax amount of approximately $8.1 million of net unrealized gains that are currently reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss in net operating interest income as a yield adjustment in the same periods in which the related items affect earnings. The losses accumulated in other comprehensive loss on terminated derivative instruments will be included in net operating interest income over the periods the related items will affect earnings, ranging from 14 days to approximately 13 years.

Changes in the fair value of the derivatives are recognized currently in the gains on loans and securities, net line item.  Fair value hedges are accounted for by recording the fair value of the derivative instrument and the change in fair value of the asset or liability being hedged on the consolidated balance sheet. To the extent that the hedge is ineffective, the changes in the fair values will not offset and the difference, or hedge ineffectiveness, is reflected in the gains on loans and securities, net line item in the consolidated statement of loss. Cash payments or receipts and related accruals during the reporting period on derivatives included in fair value hedge relationships are recorded as an adjustment to interest income or interest expense on the hedged item.  Hedge accounting is discontinued for fair value hedges if a derivative instrument ceases to be highly effective as a hedge or if the derivative is sold, terminated or de-designated. If fair value hedge accounting is discontinued, the net gain or loss on the asset or liability being hedged at the time of de-designation is amortized to interest expense or interest income over the expected remaining life of the hedged item using the effective interest method. Changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments after de-designation of fair value hedge accounting are recorded in the gains on loans and securities, net line item in the consolidated statement of loss. For a discontinued fair value hedge, the previously hedged item is no longer adjusted for changes in fair value.

If approved by the stockholders at the Company’s 2010 Annual Meeting, which is scheduled to be held on May 13, 2010, the reverse stock split should become effective in early June 2010.  Conversions of Convertible Debentures  During the three months ended March 31, 2010, $60.8 million of the Company’s convertible debentures were converted into 58.8 million shares of common stock.  NOTE 13—LOSS PER SHARE  The following table is a reconciliation of basic and diluted loss per share (in thousands, except per share amounts):                    Three Months EndedMarch 31,         2010     2009     Basic:             Numerator:             Net loss   $ (47,837 )    $ (232,685 )                      Denominator:             Basic weighted-average shares outstanding     1,921,951       567,833                       Diluted:             Numerator:             Net loss   $ (47,837 )    $ (232,685 )                      Denominator:             Diluted weighted-average shares outstanding     1,921,951       567,833                       Per share:             Basic loss per share:             Net loss per share   $ (0.02 )    $ (0.41 )                      Diluted loss per share:             Net loss per share   $ (0.02 )    $ (0.41 )                    For the three months ended March 31, 2010 and 2009, the Company excluded the following shares from the calculations of diluted loss per share as the effect would have been anti-dilutive (shares in millions):                Three Months EndedMarch 31,       2010   2009   Shares excluded as a result of the Company’s net loss:         Stock options and restricted stock awards and units   10.2   3.0   Convertible debentures   959.2   —    Other stock options and restricted stock awards and units   29.4   32.3             Total   998.8   35.3             75    Table of Contents NOTE 14—REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS  Registered Broker-Dealers  The Company’s U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to the Uniform Net Capital Rule (the “Rule”) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 administered by the SEC and FINRA, which requires the maintenance of minimum net capital. The minimum net capital requirements can be met under either the Aggregate Indebtedness method or the Alternative method. Under the Aggregate Indebtedness method, a broker-dealer is required to maintain minimum net capital of the greater of 6 2/ 3% of its aggregate indebtedness, as defined, or a minimum dollar amount. Under the Alternative method, a broker-dealer is required to maintain net capital equal to the greater of $250,000 or 2% of aggregate debit balances arising from customer transactions. The method used depends on the individual U.S. broker-dealer subsidiary. The Company’s international broker-dealer subsidiaries, located in Europe and Asia, are subject to capital requirements determined by their respective regulators.  As of March 31, 2010, all of the Company’s broker-dealer subsidiaries met minimum net capital requirements. Total required net capital was $0.1 billion at March 31, 2010. In addition, the Company’s broker-dealer subsidiaries had excess net capital of $0.6 billion at March 31, 2010. Banking  E*TRADE Bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can trigger certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on E*TRADE Bank’s financial condition and results of operations. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, E*TRADE Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of E*TRADE Bank’s assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. In addition, E*TRADE Bank may not pay dividends to the parent company without approval from the OTS and any loans by E*TRADE Bank to the parent company and its other non-bank subsidiaries are subject to various quantitative, arm’s length, collateralization and other requirements. E*TRADE Bank’s capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors.  Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require E*TRADE Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of Total and Tier I capital to risk-weighted assets and Tier I capital to adjusted total assets. As shown in the table below, at both March 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, the OTS categorized E*TRADE Bank as “well capitalized” under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. However, events beyond management’s control, such as a continued deterioration in residential real estate and credit markets, could adversely affect future earnings and E*TRADE Bank’s ability to meet its future capital requirements.  E*TRADE Bank’s required actual capital amounts and ratios are presented in the table below (dollars in thousands):                            Actual     Minimum Required to beWell Capitalized UnderPrompt Corrective Action Provisions     ExcessCapital      Amount   Ratio     Amount   Ratio       March 31, 2010:                        Total capital to risk-weighted assets   $ 3,114,581   14.36 %    > $2,168,935   > 10.0 %    $ 945,646   Tier I capital to risk-weighted assets   $ 2,835,312   13.07 %    > $1,301,361   > 6.0 %    $ 1,533,951   Tier I capital to adjusted total assets   $ 2,869,133   6.83 %    > $2,100,873   > 5.0 %    $ 768,260   December 31, 2009:                        Total capital to risk-weighted assets   $ 3,102,618   14.08 %    > $2,203,492   > 10.0 %    $ 899,126   Tier I capital to risk-weighted assets   $ 2,818,370   12.79 %    > $1,322,095   > 6.0 %    $ 1,496,275   Tier I capital to adjusted total assets   $ 2,860,312   6.69 %    > $2,136,752   > 5.0 %    $ 723,560   76    Table of Contents NOTE 15—COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENCIES AND OTHER REGULATORY MATTERS  Legal Matters  Litigation Matters  On October 27, 2000, Ajaxo, Inc. (“Ajaxo”) filed a complaint in the Superior Court for the State of California, County of Santa Clara. Ajaxo sought damages and certain non-monetary relief for the Company’s alleged breach of a non-disclosure agreement with Ajaxo pertaining to certain wireless technology that Ajaxo offered the Company as well as damages and other relief against the Company for their alleged misappropriation of Ajaxo’s trade secrets. Following a jury trial, a judgment was entered in 2003 in favor of Ajaxo against the Company for $1.3 million dollars for breach of the Ajaxo non-disclosure agreement. Although the jury also found in favor of Ajaxo on its claim against the Company for misappropriation of trade secrets, the trial court subsequently denied Ajaxo’s requests for additional damages and relief. On December 21, 2005, the California Court of Appeal affirmed the above-described award against the Company for breach of the nondisclosure agreement but remanded the case to the trial court for the limited purpose of determining what, if any, additional damages Ajaxo may be entitled to as a result of the jury’s previous finding in favor of Ajaxo on its claim against the Company for misappropriation of trade secrets. Although the Company paid Ajaxo the full amount due on the above-described judgment, the case, consistent with the rulings issued by the Court of Appeal, was remanded back to the trial court, and on May 30, 2008, a jury returned a verdict in favor of the Company denying all claims raised and demands for damages against the Company. Following the trial court’s filing of entry of judgment in favor of the Company on September 5, 2008, Ajaxo filed post-trial motions for vacating this entry of judgment and requesting a new trial. On November 4, 2008, the trial court denied these motions. On December 2, 2008, Ajaxo filed a notice of appeal with the Court of Appeal of the State of California for the Sixth District, and the parties completed the briefing of Ajaxo’s appeal on December 14, 2009. The Company will continue to vigorously defend itself and oppose Ajaxo’s appeal.  On October 11, 2006, a state class action was filed by Nikki Greenberg on her own behalf and on behalf of all those similarly situated plaintiffs, in the Superior Court for the State of California, County of Los Angeles on behalf of all customers or consumers who allegedly made or received telephone calls from the Company that were recorded without their knowledge or consent. On February 7, 2008, class certification was granted and the class defined to consist of (1) all persons in California who received telephone calls from the Company and whose calls were recorded without their consent within three years of October 11, 2006, and (2) all persons who made calls from California to the Beverly Hills branch of the Company on August 8, 2006. Plaintiffs sought to recover unspecified monetary damages plus injunctive relief, including punitive and exemplary damages, interest, attorneys’ fees and costs. On October 16, 2009, the court granted final approval of the parties’ proposed settlement agreement. Objectors to the court’s order granting final approval of the parties’ settlement agreement filed notices of appeal which were subsequently dismissed on January 26, 2010. The Company paid the settlement amount to the Claims Administrator on March 5, 2010. The matter will remain open through administration of the settlement.  On October 2, 2007, a class action complaint alleging violations of the federal securities laws was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against the Company and its then Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, Mitchell H. Caplan and Robert J. Simmons by Larry Freudenberg on his own behalf and on behalf of others similarly situated (the “Freudenberg Action”). On July 17, 2008, the trial court consolidated this action with four other purported class actions, all of which were filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York and which were based on the same facts and circumstances. On January 16, 2009, plaintiffs served their consolidated amended class action complaint in which they also named Dennis Webb, the Company’s former Capital Markets Division President as a defendant. Plaintiffs contend, among other things, that the value of the Company’s stock between April 19, 2006 and November 9, 2007 was artificially inflated because defendants issued materially false and misleading statements and failed to disclose that the Company was experiencing a rise in delinquency rates in its mortgage and home equity portfolios; failed to timely record an impairment on its mortgage and home equity portfolios; materially overvalued its securities portfolio, which included assets backed by mortgages; and based on the foregoing,    77    Table of Contents  lacked a reasonable basis for the positive statements made about the Company’s earnings and prospects. Plaintiffs seek to recover damages in an amount to be proven at trial, including interest and attorneys’ fees and costs. Defendants filed their motion to dismiss on April 2, 2009, and briefing on defendants’ motion to dismiss was completed on August 31, 2009. The Company intends to vigorously defend itself against these claims.  On August 15, 2008, Ronald M. Tate as trustee of the Ronald M. Tate Trust Dtd 4/13/88, and George Avakian filed an action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against the Company, Mitchell H. Caplan and Robert J. Simmons based on the same facts and circumstances, and containing the same claims, as the Freudenberg consolidated actions discussed above. By agreement of the parties and approval of the court, the Tate action has been consolidated with the Freudenberg consolidated actions for the purpose of pre-trial discovery. Plaintiffs seek to recover damages in an amount to be proven at trial, including interest, attorneys’ and expert fees and costs. The Company intends to vigorously defend itself against these claims.  Based upon the same facts and circumstances alleged in the Freudenberg consolidated actions above, a verified shareholder derivative complaint was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on October 4, 2007 by Catherine Rubery, against the Company and its then Chief Executive Officer, President/Chief Operating Officer, Chief Financial Officer and individual members of its board of directors. Plaintiff alleges, among other things, causes of action for breach of fiduciary duty, waste of corporate assets, unjust enrichment, and violation of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder. The above federal shareholder derivative complaint has been consolidated with another shareholder derivative complaint brought by shareholder Marilyn Clark in the same court and against the same named defendants. Three similar derivative actions, based on the same facts and circumstances as the federal derivative actions, but alleging exclusively state causes of action, have been filed in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County and have been ordered consolidated in that court. In these state derivative actions, plaintiffs Frank Fosbre, Brian Kallinen and Alexander Guiseppone filed a consolidated amended complaint on March 23, 2009. Plaintiffs in the foregoing actions seek unspecified monetary damages against the Individual Defendants in favor of the Company, plus an injunction compelling changes to the Company’s Corporate Governance policies. By agreement of the parties and approval of the respective courts, further proceedings in both these federal and state derivative actions will continue to trail those in the federal securities class actions discussed above.  On April 2, 2008, a class action complaint alleging violations of the federal securities laws was filed by John W. Oughtred on his own behalf and on behalf of all others similarly situated in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against the Company. Plaintiff contends, among other things, that the Company committed various sales practice violations in the sale of certain auction rate securities to investors between April 2, 2003, and February 13, 2008 by allegedly misrepresenting that these securities were highly liquid and safe investments for short term investing. On December 18, 2008, plaintiffs filed their first amended class action complaint. Defendants filed their pending motion to dismiss plaintiffs’ amended complaint on February 5, 2009, and briefing on defendants’ motion to dismiss was completed on April 15, 2009. Plaintiffs seek to recover damages in an amount to be proven at trial, or, in the alternative, rescission of auction rate securities purchases, plus interest and attorney’s fees and costs. On March 18, 2010, the District Court dismissed the complaint without prejudice. Plaintiff has an opportunity to amend the complaint. On April 22, 2010, Plaintiff amended their complaint. The Company intends to continue to vigorously defend itself against the claims raised in this action.  Prior to Lehman Brothers’ declaration of bankruptcy in September 2008, E*TRADE Bank was a counterparty to interest rate derivative contracts with a subsidiary of Lehman Brothers. The declaration of bankruptcy by Lehman Brothers triggered an event of default and early termination under E*TRADE Bank’s International Swap Dealers Association Master Agreement. As of the date of the event of default, E*TRADE Bank’s net amount due to the Lehman Brothers subsidiary was approximately $101 million, the majority of which was collateralized by securities held by or on behalf of the Lehman Brothers subsidiary. E*TRADE Bank currently is negotiating with Lehman Brothers in an attempt to resolve the parties’ respective obligations.    78    Table of Contents On February 3, 2010, a class action complaint was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California against E*TRADE Securities LLC by Joseph Roling on his own behalf and on behalf of all others similarly situated. The lead plaintiff alleges that E*TRADE Securities LLC unlawfully charged and collected certain account activity fees from its customers. Claimant, on behalf of himself and the putative class, asserts breach of contract, unjust enrichment and violation of California Civil Code Section 1671 and seeks equitable and injunctive relief for alleged illegal, unfair and fraudulent practices under California’s Unfair Competition Law, California Business and Professional Code Section 17200 et seq. The plaintiff seeks, among other things, certification of the class action on behalf of alleged similarly situated plaintiffs, unspecified damages and restitution of amounts allegedly wrongfully collected by E*TRADE Securities LLC, attorneys fees and expenses and injunctive relief. The Company intends to vigorously defend itself against the claims raised in this action.  On March 8, 2010, Lindsay Lohan filed a complaint in the New York Supreme Court, Nassau County, against E*TRADE Bank and E*TRADE Securities LLC. The Plaintiff alleges that E*TRADE’s television advertising made unauthorized use of her characterization and likeness in violation of Section 51 of the New York State Civil Rights Law. The Claimant seeks $100 million in damages. The Company intends to vigorously defend itself against these claims.  In addition to the matters described above, the Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the normal course of business which could have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In each pending matter, the Company contests liability or the amount of claimed damages. In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of such matters, particularly in cases where claimants seek substantial or indeterminate damages, or where investigation or discovery have yet to be completed, the Company cannot predict with certainty the loss or range of loss related to such matters, how such matters will be resolved, when they will ultimately be resolved, or what any eventual settlement, fine, penalty or other relief might be. Subject to the foregoing, the Company believes that the outcome of any such pending matter will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition of the Company, although the outcome could be material to the Company’s or a business segment’s operating results in the future, depending, among other things, upon the Company’s or business segment’s income for such period.  An unfavorable outcome in any matter that is not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, even if the ultimate outcomes are resolved in the Company’s favor, the defense of such litigation could entail considerable cost or the diversion of the efforts of management, either of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.  Regulatory Matters  The securities and banking industries are subject to extensive regulation under federal, state and applicable international laws. From time to time, the Company has been threatened with or named as a defendant in, lawsuits, arbitrations and administrative claims involving securities, banking and other matters. The Company is also subject to periodic regulatory audits and inspections. Compliance and trading problems that are reported to regulators, such as the SEC, FINRA, OTS or FDIC by dissatisfied customers or others are investigated by such regulators, and may, if pursued, result in formal claims being filed against the Company by customers or disciplinary action being taken against the Company or its employees by regulators. Any such claims or disciplinary actions that are decided against the Company could have a material impact on the financial results of the Company or any of its subsidiaries.  On October 17, 2007, the SEC initiated an informal inquiry into matters related to the Company’s mortgage loan and mortgage-related securities investment portfolios. The Company is cooperating fully with the SEC in this matter.    79    Table of Contents Beginning in approximately August 2008, representatives of various states attorneys general and FINRA initiated inquiries regarding the purchase of auction rate securities by E*TRADE Securities LLC’s customers. E*TRADE Securities LLC is cooperating with these inquiries. As of March 31, 2010, the total amount of auction rate securities held by all E*TRADE Securities LLC customers was approximately $167.3 million.  On January 19, 2010, the North Carolina Securities Division filed an administrative petition against E*TRADE Securities LLC seeking to revoke the North Carolina securities dealer registration of E*TRADE Securities LLC or, alternatively, to suspend that registration until all North Carolina residents are made whole for their investments in auction rate securities purchased through E*TRADE Securities LLC. E*TRADE Securities LLC is defending that action. As of March 31, 2010, the total amount of auction rate securities held by North Carolina customers is approximately $2.1 million.  Insurance  The Company maintains insurance coverage that management believes is reasonable and prudent. The principal insurance coverage it maintains covers commercial general liability; property damage; hardware/software damage; cyber liability; directors and officers; employment practices liability; certain criminal acts against the Company; and errors and omissions. The Company believes that such insurance coverage is adequate for the purpose of its business. The Company’s ability to maintain this level of insurance coverage in the future, however, is subject to the availability of affordable insurance in the marketplace.  Reserves  For all legal matters, reserves are established in accordance with the loss contingencies accounting guidance. Once established, reserves are adjusted based on available information when an event occurs requiring an adjustment.  Loans  The Company provides access to real estate loans for its customers through a third party company. This lending product is offered as a convenience to the Company’s customers and is not one of its primary product offerings. The Company structured this arrangement to minimize the assumption of any of the typical risks commonly associated with mortgage lending. The third party company providing this product performs all processing and underwriting of these loans. Shortly after closing, the third party company purchases the loans from the Company and is responsible for the credit risk associated with these loans. The Company had $36.7 million in commitments to originate loans, $3.5 million in commitments to sell loans and no commitments to purchase loans at March 31, 2010.  Securities, Unused Lines of Credit and Certificates of Deposit  At March 31, 2010, the Company had commitments to purchase $0.3 billion and sell $0.5 billion in securities. In addition, the Company had approximately $0.9 billion of certificates of deposit scheduled to mature in less than one year and $1.2 billion of unfunded commitments to extend credit.  Guarantees   In prior periods when the Company sold loans, the Company provided guarantees to investors purchasing mortgage loans, which are considered standard representations and warranties within the mortgage industry. The primary guarantees are that: the mortgage and the mortgage note have been duly executed and each is the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable in accordance with its terms; the mortgage has been duly acknowledged and recorded and is valid; and the mortgage and the mortgage note are not subject to any right of rescission, set-off, counterclaim or defense, including, without limitation, the defense of usury, and no    80    Table of Contents  such right of rescission, set-off, counterclaim or defense has been asserted with respect thereto. The Company is responsible for the guarantees on loans sold. If these claims prove to be untrue, the investor can require the Company to repurchase the loan and return all loan purchase and servicing release premiums. Management has determined that quantifying the potential liability exposure is not meaningful due to the nature of the standard representations and warranties, which have resulted in a minimal amount of loan repurchases.  ETBH raised capital through the formation of trusts, which sold trust preferred securities in the capital markets. The capital securities are mandatorily redeemable in whole at the due date, which is generally 30 years after issuance. Each trust issues trust preferred securities at par, with a liquidation amount of $1,000 per capital security. The proceeds from the sale of issuances are invested in ETBH’s subordinated debentures.  During the 30-year period prior to the redemption of the trust preferred securities, ETBH guarantees the accrued and unpaid distributions on these securities, as well as the redemption price of the securities and certain costs that may be incurred in liquidating, terminating or dissolving the trusts (all of which would otherwise be payable by the trusts). At March 31, 2010, management estimated that the maximum potential liability under this arrangement is equal to approximately $436.6 million or the total face value of these securities plus dividends, which may be unpaid at the termination of the trust arrangement.  NOTE 16—SEGMENT INFORMATION  In the first quarter of 2010, the Company revised its segment financial reporting to reflect the manner in which its chief operating decision maker had begun assessing the Company’s performance and making resource allocation decisions. The Company no longer allocates costs associated with certain functions that are centrally managed to its operating segments. These costs are separately reported in a “Corporate/Other” category.  In addition, the Company now reports FDIC insurance premiums expense in its balance sheet management segment. These expenses were previously reported in its trading and investing segment. Balance sheet management pays the trading and investing segment for the use of its deposits via the deposit transfer pricing arrangement, including a reimbursement for the cost associated FDIC insurance. This change did not impact the income (loss) before income taxes of either segment as the component of the deposit transfer pricing payment for FDIC insurance premiums expense was removed.  The Company’s segment financial information from prior periods has been reclassified in accordance with the new segment financial reporting.  Trading and investing includes:        •    trading and investing related brokerage products and services;        •    investor-focused banking products;        •    market-making; and        •    software and services for managing equity compensation plans.  Balance sheet management includes:        •    managing asset allocation and credit, liquidity and interest rate risk;        •    managing loans previously originated or purchased from third parties; and        •    managing customer cash and deposits.  Corporate/Other includes:        •    centrally managed functions including: finance, human resources, legal, compliance and risk management;        •    technology related costs incurred to support the centrally managed functions;    81    Table of Contents     •    restructuring and other exit activities; and        •    corporate debt and corporate investments.  The Company evaluates the performance of its segments based on income (loss) before income taxes.  Financial information for the Company’s reportable segments is presented in the following tables (dollars in thousands):                                Three Months Ended March 31, 2010        Trading

NOTE 17—SUBSEQUENT EVENTS  International Brokerage Business  The Company closed the sales of the local market trading operations in the Nordic region and United Kingdom in April 2010. The Company recorded a slight gain on the sales of these local market trading operations.  Secondary Offering of Common Stock by Affiliates of Citadel Investment Group  On May 4, 2010, the Company completed a secondary offering by affiliates of Citadel Investment Group of 172 million shares of its common stock at a public offering price of $1.75 per share. The Company did not issue any shares to the public nor did it receive any proceeds from this offering. All of the shares sold were held by affiliates of Citadel Investment Group.  Conversion of Convertible Debentures  As of May 4, 2010, a total of $1.0 billion of the convertible debentures ($1.0 billion of the Class A convertible debentures and $2.1 million of the Class B convertible debentures) had been converted into 995.9 million shares of common equity. The remaining face value of the convertible debentures as of May 4, 2010 was approximately $711.4 million.      ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES        (a)   Our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, after evaluating the effectiveness of the Company’s “disclosure controls and procedures” (as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report, have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective based on their evaluation of these controls and procedures required by paragraph (b) of Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15.        (b)   Our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer have evaluated the changes to the Company’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our last fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2010, as required by paragraph (d) of Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15, and have concluded that there were no such changes that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.  PART II—OTHER INFORMATION      ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS  On October 27, 2000, Ajaxo, Inc. (“Ajaxo”) filed a complaint in the Superior Court for the State of California, County of Santa Clara. Ajaxo sought damages and certain non-monetary relief for the Company’s alleged breach of a non-disclosure agreement with Ajaxo pertaining to certain wireless technology that Ajaxo offered the Company as well as damages and other relief against the Company for their alleged misappropriation of Ajaxo’s trade secrets. Following a jury trial, a judgment was entered in 2003 in favor of Ajaxo against the Company for $1.3 million dollars for breach of the Ajaxo non-disclosure agreement. Although the jury also found in favor of Ajaxo on its claim against the Company for misappropriation of trade secrets, the trial court subsequently denied Ajaxo’s requests for additional damages and relief. On December 21, 2005, the California Court of Appeal affirmed the above-described award against the Company for breach of the nondisclosure    84    Table of Contents  agreement but remanded the case to the trial court for the limited purpose of determining what, if any, additional damages Ajaxo may be entitled to as a result of the jury’s previous finding in favor of Ajaxo on its claim against the Company for misappropriation of trade secrets. Although the Company paid Ajaxo the full amount due on the above-described judgment, the case, consistent with the rulings issued by the Court of Appeal, was remanded back to the trial court, and on May 30, 2008, a jury returned a verdict in favor of the Company denying all claims raised and demands for damages against the Company. Following the trial court’s filing of entry of judgment in favor of the Company on September 5, 2008, Ajaxo filed post-trial motions for vacating this entry of judgment and requesting a new trial. On November 4, 2008, the trial court denied these motions. On December 2, 2008, Ajaxo filed a notice of appeal with the Court of Appeal of the State of California for the Sixth District, and the parties completed the briefing of Ajaxo’s appeal on December 14, 2009. The Company will continue to vigorously defend itself and oppose Ajaxo’s appeal.  On October 11, 2006, a state class action was filed by Nikki Greenberg on her own behalf and on behalf of all those similarly situated plaintiffs, in the Superior Court for the State of California, County of Los Angeles on behalf of all customers or consumers who allegedly made or received telephone calls from the Company that were recorded without their knowledge or consent. On February 7, 2008, class certification was granted and the class defined to consist of (1) all persons in California who received telephone calls from the Company and whose calls were recorded without their consent within three years of October 11, 2006, and (2) all persons who made calls from California to the Beverly Hills branch of the Company on August 8, 2006. Plaintiffs sought to recover unspecified monetary damages plus injunctive relief, including punitive and exemplary damages, interest, attorneys’ fees and costs. On October 16, 2009, the court granted final approval of the parties’ proposed settlement agreement. Objectors to the court’s order granting final approval of the parties’ settlement agreement filed notices of appeal which were subsequently dismissed on January 26, 2010. The Company paid the settlement amount to the Claims Administrator on March 5, 2010. The matter will remain open through administration of the settlement.  On October 2, 2007, a class action complaint alleging violations of the federal securities laws was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against the Company and its then Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, Mitchell H. Caplan and Robert J. Simmons by Larry Freudenberg on his own behalf and on behalf of others similarly situated (the “Freudenberg Action”). On July 17, 2008, the trial court consolidated this action with four other purported class actions, all of which were filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York and which were based on the same facts and circumstances. On January 16, 2009, plaintiffs served their consolidated amended class action complaint in which they also named Dennis Webb, the Company’s former Capital Markets Division President as a defendant. Plaintiffs contend, among other things, that the value of the Company’s stock between April 19, 2006 and November 9, 2007 was artificially inflated because defendants issued materially false and misleading statements and failed to disclose that the Company was experiencing a rise in delinquency rates in its mortgage and home equity portfolios; failed to timely record an impairment on its mortgage and home equity portfolios; materially overvalued its securities portfolio, which included assets backed by mortgages; and based on the foregoing, lacked a reasonable basis for the positive statements made about the Company’s earnings and prospects. Plaintiffs seek to recover damages in an amount to be proven at trial, including interest and attorneys’ fees and costs. Defendants filed their motion to dismiss on April 2, 2009, and briefing on defendants’ motion to dismiss was completed on August 31, 2009. The Company intends to vigorously defend itself against these claims.  On August 15, 2008, Ronald M. Tate as trustee of the Ronald M. Tate Trust Dtd 4/13/88, and George Avakian filed an action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against the Company, Mitchell H. Caplan and Robert J. Simmons based on the same facts and circumstances, and containing the same claims, as the Freudenberg consolidated actions discussed above. By agreement of the parties and approval of the court, the Tate action has been consolidated with the Freudenberg consolidated actions for the purpose of pre-trial discovery. Plaintiffs seek to recover damages in an amount to be proven at trial, including interest, attorneys’ and expert fees and costs. The Company intends to vigorously defend itself against these claims.    85    Table of Contents Based upon the same facts and circumstances alleged in the Freudenberg consolidated actions above, a verified shareholder derivative complaint was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on October 4, 2007 by Catherine Rubery, against the Company and its then Chief Executive Officer, President/Chief Operating Officer, Chief Financial Officer and individual members of its board of directors. Plaintiff alleges, among other things, causes of action for breach of fiduciary duty, waste of corporate assets, unjust enrichment, and violation of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder. The above federal shareholder derivative complaint has been consolidated with another shareholder derivative complaint brought by shareholder Marilyn Clark in the same court and against the same named defendants. Three similar derivative actions, based on the same facts and circumstances as the federal derivative actions, but alleging exclusively state causes of action, have been filed in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County and have been ordered consolidated in that court. In these state derivative actions, plaintiffs Frank Fosbre, Brian Kallinen and Alexander Guiseppone filed a consolidated amended complaint on March 23, 2009. Plaintiffs in the foregoing actions seek unspecified monetary damages against the Individual Defendants in favor of the Company, plus an injunction compelling changes to the Company’s Corporate Governance policies. By agreement of the parties and approval of the respective courts, further proceedings in both these federal and state derivative actions will continue to trail those in the federal securities class actions discussed above.  On April 2, 2008, a class action complaint alleging violations of the federal securities laws was filed by John W. Oughtred on his own behalf and on behalf of all others similarly situated in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against the Company. Plaintiff contends, among other things, that the Company committed various sales practice violations in the sale of certain auction rate securities to investors between April 2, 2003, and February 13, 2008 by allegedly misrepresenting that these securities were highly liquid and safe investments for short term investing. On December 18, 2008, plaintiffs filed their first amended class action complaint. Defendants filed their pending motion to dismiss plaintiffs’ amended complaint on February 5, 2009, and briefing on defendants’ motion to dismiss was completed on April 15, 2009. Plaintiffs seek to recover damages in an amount to be proven at trial, or, in the alternative, rescission of auction rate securities purchases, plus interest and attorney’s fees and costs. On March 18, 2010, the District Court dismissed the complaint without prejudice. On April 22, 2010, Plaintiff amended their complaint. The Company intends to continue to vigorously defend itself against the claims raised in this action.  On October 17, 2007, the SEC initiated an informal inquiry into matters related to the Company’s mortgage loan and mortgage-related securities investment portfolios. The Company is cooperating fully with the SEC in this matter.  Beginning in approximately August 2008, representatives of various states attorneys general and FINRA initiated inquiries regarding the purchase of auction rate securities by E*TRADE Securities LLC’s customers. E*TRADE Securities LLC is cooperating with these inquiries. As of March 31, 2010, the total amount of auction rate securities held by all E*TRADE Securities LLC customers was approximately $167.3 million.  Prior to Lehman Brothers’ declaration of bankruptcy in September 2008, E*TRADE Bank was a counterparty to interest rate derivative contracts with a subsidiary of Lehman Brothers. The declaration of bankruptcy by Lehman Brothers triggered an event of default and early termination under E*TRADE Bank’s International Swap Dealers Association Master Agreement. As of the date of the event of default, E*TRADE Bank’s net amount due to the Lehman Brothers subsidiary was approximately $101 million, the majority of which was collateralized by securities held by or on behalf of the Lehman Brothers subsidiary. E*TRADE Bank currently is negotiating with Lehman Brothers in an attempt to resolve the parties’ respective obligations.  On January 19, 2010, the North Carolina Securities Division filed an administrative petition against E*TRADE Securities LLC seeking to revoke the North Carolina securities dealer registration of E*TRADE Securities LLC or, alternatively, to suspend that registration until all North Carolina residents are made whole for their investments in auction rate securities purchased through E*TRADE Securities LLC. E*TRADE Securities LLC is defending that action. As of March 31, 2010, the total amount of auction rate securities held by North Carolina customers is approximately $2.1 million.    86    Table of Contents On February 3, 2010, a class action complaint was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California against E*TRADE Securities LLC by Joseph Roling on his own behalf and on behalf of all others similarly situated. The lead plaintiff alleges that E*TRADE Securities LLC unlawfully charged and collected certain account activity fees from its customers. Claimant, on behalf of himself and the putative class, asserts breach of contract, unjust enrichment and violation of California Civil Code Section 1671 and seeks equitable and injunctive relief for alleged illegal, unfair and fraudulent practices under California’s Unfair Competition Law, California Business and Professional Code Section 17200 et seq. The plaintiff seeks, among other things, certification of the class action on behalf of alleged similarly situated plaintiffs, unspecified damages and restitution of amounts allegedly wrongfully collected by E*TRADE Securities LLC, attorneys fees and expenses and injunctive relief. The Company intends to vigorously defend itself against the claims raised in this action.  On March 8, 2010, Lindsay Lohan filed a complaint in the New York Supreme Court, Nassau County, against E*TRADE Bank and E*TRADE Securities LLC. The Plaintiff alleges that E*TRADE’s television advertising made unauthorized use of her characterization and likeness in violation of Section 51 of the New York State Civil Rights Law. The Claimant seeks $100 million in damages. The Company intends to vigorously defend itself against these claims.  In addition to the matters described above, the Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the normal course of business which could have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In each pending matter, the Company contests liability or the amount of claimed damages. In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of such matters, particularly in cases where claimants seek substantial or indeterminate damages, or where investigation or discovery have yet to be completed, the Company cannot predict with certainty the loss or range of loss related to such matters, how such matters will be resolved, when they will ultimately be resolved, or what any eventual settlement, fine, penalty or other relief might be. Subject to the foregoing, the Company believes that the outcome of any such pending matter will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition of the Company, although the outcome could be material to the Company’s or a business segment’s operating results in the future, depending, among other things, upon the Company’s or business segment’s income for such period.  An unfavorable outcome in any matter that is not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, even if the ultimate outcomes are resolved in the Company’s favor, the defense of such litigation could entail considerable cost or the diversion of the efforts of management, either of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.  The Company maintains insurance coverage that management believes is reasonable and prudent. The principal insurance coverage it maintains covers commercial general liability; property damage; hardware/software damage; cyber liability; directors and officers; employment practices liability; certain criminal acts against the Company; and errors and omissions. The Company believes that such insurance coverage is adequate for the purpose of its business. The Company’s ability to maintain this level of insurance coverage in the future, however, is subject to the availability of affordable insurance in the marketplace.      ITEM 1A.
