Item 1A. Risk Factors.  Credit Risk Management  Our primary sources of credit risk are our loan and securities portfolios, where risk results from extending credit to customers and purchasing securities, respectively. The degree of credit risk associated with our loans and securities varies based on many factors including the size of the transaction, the credit characteristics of the borrower, features of the loan product or security, the contractual terms of the related documents and the availability and quality of collateral. Credit risk is one of the most common risks in financial services and is one of our most significant risks.  Credit risk is monitored by our Credit Risk Committee. The Credit Risk Committee uses detailed tracking and analysis to measure credit performance and reviews and modifies credit policies as appropriate.  Housing Market Conditions  Conditions in the residential real estate and credit markets, which deteriorated sharply during 2007, continued to be extremely challenging in 2008 and into the first quarter of 2009. The significant and abrupt evaporation of secondary market liquidity for various types of mortgage loans, particularly home equity loans, has decreased the overall availability of housing credit. As a result, many borrowers, particularly those in markets with declining housing prices, have been unable to refinance existing loans. This combination of a decline in the availability of credit and a decline in housing prices creates significant credit risk in our loan portfolio, particularly in our home equity loan portfolio.  Loss Mitigation  Given the deterioration in the performance of our loan portfolio, particularly in our home equity loan portfolio, we formed a special credit management team to focus on the mitigation of potential losses in the home equity loan portfolio.    27    Table of Contents This team’s primary focus is reducing our exposure to open home equity lines. Through a variety of strategies, including voluntary line closures, automatically freezing lines on all delinquent accounts, and freezing lines on loans with materially reduced home equity, we have reduced this amount from a high of over $7 billion in 2007 to $2.0 billion as of March 31, 2009.  The team has several other initiatives either in progress or in development which are focused on mitigating losses in our home equity loan portfolio. Those initiatives include improving collection efforts and practices of our servicers as well as increasing our loss recovery efforts to minimize the level of loss on a loan that goes to charge-off.  We also initiated a loan modification program that resulted in an insignificant number of minor modifications in 2008. This loan modification program became more active during the first quarter of 2009. We consider modifications in which we made a significant economic concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty a troubled debt restructuring (“TDR”). As of March 31, 2009, we had modified $115.7 million of loans in which the modification was considered a TDR. We also modified a small number of loans through traditional collections actions taken in the normal course of servicing delinquent accounts. These actions did not include a significant economic concession to the borrower. On February 18, 2009, the U.S. Department of the Treasury announced the Homeowner Affordability and Stability Plan. The primary focus of this plan is to create requirements and provide incentives to modify mortgages with the goal of avoiding foreclosure. We believe our loan modification program goals are in line with the Homeowner Affordability and Stability Plan and we expect to participate in this program. Our loan modification programs target borrowers who demonstrate a willingness and capacity to meet their loan obligations and stay in their homes. To date our programs have focused on modifications to the rate and term of loans often resulting in a lower monthly payment for the borrower. Our current programs are not focused on reducing the overall balance of the loan; however, we plan to test a program of this kind in the second quarter of 2009.  In addition, we continue to review our mortgage loan portfolio in order to identify loans to be repurchased by the originator. Our review is primarily focused on identifying loans with early payment defaults, violations of transaction representations and warranties, or material misrepresentation on the part of the seller. Any loans identified with these deficiencies are submitted to the original seller for repurchase. For the three months ended March 31, 2009, approximately $14.3 million of loans, and the year ended December 31, 2008, approximately $105.6 million of loans were repurchased by the original sellers.  Underwriting Standards – Originated Loans  During the second quarter of 2008, we exited our retail mortgage origination business, which represented our last remaining loan origination channel. During the three months ended March 31, 2008, we originated approximately $116 million in one- to four-family loans through our retail mortgage origination business. These loans were predominantly prime credit quality first-lien mortgage loans secured by a single-family residence. In March 2009, we partnered with a third party company to provide access to real estate loans for our customers. This product is being offered as a convenience to our customers and is not one of our primary product offerings. We structured this arrangement to minimize our taking on any of the typical risks commonly associated with mortgage lending. The third party company providing this product performs all processing and underwriting of these loans. Shortly after closing, the third party company purchases the loans from us and is responsible for the credit risk associated with these loans. We did not originate any loans during the three months ended March 31, 2009; however, we had commitments to originate mortgage loans of $16.3 million at March 31, 2009.  CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK  Loans  We track and review many factors to predict and monitor credit risk in our loan portfolios, which are primarily made up of loans secured by residential real estate. These factors, which are documented at the time of origination, include: borrowers’ debt-to-income ratio, borrowers’ credit scores, housing prices, documentation     28    Table of Contents  type, occupancy type, and loan type. We also review estimated current loan-to-value (“LTV”) ratios when monitoring credit risk in our loan portfolios. In economic conditions in which housing prices generally appreciate, we believe that loan type, LTV ratios and credit scores are the key factors in determining future loan performance. In the current housing market with declining home prices and less credit available for refinance, we believe the LTV ratio becomes a more important factor in predicting and monitoring credit risk.  We believe certain categories of loans inherently have a higher level of credit risk due to characteristics of the borrower and/or features of the loan. Two of these categories are sub-prime and option ARM loans. As a general matter, we did not originate or purchase these loans to hold on our balance sheet; however, in the normal course of purchasing large pools of real estate loans, we invariably ended up acquiring a de minimis amount of sub-prime loans. As of March 31, 2009, sub-prime(1) real estate loans represented less than one-fifth of one percent of our total real estate loan portfolio and we held no option ARM loans.  As noted above, we believe loan type, LTV ratios and borrowers’ credit scores are key determinants of future loan performance. Our home equity loan portfolio is primarily second lien loans(2) on residential real estate properties, which have a higher level of credit risk than first lien mortgage loans. We believe home equity loans with a combined loan-to-value (“CLTV”) of 90% or higher or a Fair Isaac Credit Organization (“FICO”) score below 700 are the loans with the highest levels of credit risk in our portfolios.  The breakdowns by LTV/CLTV and FICO score of our two main loan portfolios, one-to four-family and home equity, are as follows (dollars in thousands):                            One- to Four-Family     Home Equity     LTV/CLTV at Origination(3)   March 31,2009     December 31,2008     March 31,2009     December 31,2008     <=70%   $ 5,464,533     $ 5,647,650     $ 3,009,911     $ 3,126,274     70% - 80%     6,747,255       7,008,860       1,743,760       1,822,797     80% - 90%     181,526       162,966       3,147,716       3,312,332     >90%     146,349       160,368       1,631,621       1,755,780                                       Total   $ 12,539,663     $ 12,979,844     $ 9,533,008     $ 10,017,183                                       Average LTV/CLTV at loan origination(4)      70.2 %     68.8 %     78.9 %     79.1 %   Average estimated current LTV/CLTV(5)      93.4 %     90.1 %     102.4 %     99.7 %          One- to Four-Family     Home Equity     FICO at Origination   March 31,2009     December 31,2008     March 31,2009     December 31,2008     >=720   $ 8,356,594     $ 8,680,892     $ 5,733,580     $ 6,005,837     719 - 700     1,705,307       1,750,294       1,513,409       1,591,380     699 - 680     1,308,697       1,342,967       1,306,243       1,379,218     679 - 660     760,988       784,449       561,924       595,776     659 - 620     399,382       412,514       406,108       432,862     <620     8,695       8,728       11,744       12,110                                       Total   $ 12,539,663     $ 12,979,844     $ 9,533,008     $ 10,017,183                                          (1)   Defined as borrowers with FICO scores less than 620 at the time of origination.    (2)   Approximately 14% of the home equity portfolio is in the first lien position. For home equity loans that are in a second lien position, we also hold the first lien position on the same residential real estate property for less than 1% of the loans in this portfolio.    (3)   CLTV at origination calculations for home equity are based on drawn balances.    (4)   Average LTV/CLTV at loan origination calculations are based on LTV/CLTV at time of purchase for one- to four-family purchased loans and undrawn balances for home equity loans.    (5)   The average estimated current LTV ratio reflects the outstanding balance at the balance sheet date, divided by the estimated current property value. Current property values are estimated using the most recent property value data available to us. For properties in which we did not have an updated valuation, we utilized home price indices to estimate the current property value.    29    Table of Contents In addition to the factors described above, we monitor credit trends in loans by acquisition channel and vintage, which are summarized below as of March 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008 (dollars in thousands):                        One- to Four-Family   Home Equity   Acquisition Channel   March 31,2009   December 31,2008   March 31,2009   December 31,2008   Purchased from a third party   $ 10,268,338   $ 10,646,324   $ 8,424,783   $ 8,873,156   Originated by the Company     2,271,325     2,333,520     1,108,225     1,144,027                             Total real estate loans   $ 12,539,663   $ 12,979,844   $ 9,533,008   $ 10,017,183                                    One- to Four-Family   Home Equity   Vintage Year   March 31,2009   December 31,2008   March 31,2009   December 31,2008   2003 and prior   $ 545,634   $ 577,408   $ 721,065   $ 754,054   2004     1,243,682     1,309,985     953,248     990,138   2005     2,610,376     2,695,718     2,323,470     2,426,000   2006     4,724,336     4,890,407     4,404,515     4,668,721   2007     3,385,666     3,475,661     1,113,972     1,161,667   2008(1)     29,969     30,665     16,738     16,603                             Total real estate loans   $ 12,539,663   $ 12,979,844   $ 9,533,008   $ 10,017,183                                 (1)    The increase in the 2008 home equity vintage loans for the three months ended March 31, 2009 was due to net draws on home equity lines of credit.  Allowance for Loan Losses  The allowance for loan losses is management’s estimate of credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date. The estimate of the allowance for loan losses is based on a variety of factors, including the composition and quality of the portfolio; delinquency levels and trends; current and historical charge-off and loss experience; current industry charge-off and loss experience; the condition of the real estate market and geographic concentrations within the loan portfolio; the interest rate climate; the overall availability of housing credit; and general economic conditions. The allowance for loan losses is typically equal to management’s estimate of loan charge-offs in the twelve months following the balance sheet date. Determining the adequacy of the allowance is complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Subsequent evaluations of the loan portfolio, in light of the factors then prevailing, may result in significant changes in the allowance for loan losses in future periods. We believe our allowance for loan losses at March 31, 2009 is representative of probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date.  In determining the allowance for loan losses, we allocate a portion of the allowance to various loan products based on an analysis of individual loans and pools of loans. However, the entire allowance is available to absorb credit losses inherent in the total loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date.  The following table presents the allowance for loan losses by major loan category (dollars in thousands):                                    One- to Four-Family     Home Equity     Consumer and Other     Total        Allowance   Allowanceas a % ofLoansReceivable(1)     Allowance   Allowanceas a % ofLoansReceivable(1)     Allowance   Allowanceas a % ofLoansReceivable(1)     Allowance   Allowanceas a % ofLoansReceivable(1)     March 31, 2009   $ 308,806   2.45 %   $ 818,646   8.45 %   $ 73,356   3.32 %   $ 1,200,808   4.91 %   December 31, 2008   $ 185,163   1.42 %   $ 833,835   8.19 %   $ 61,613   2.65 %   $ 1,080,611   4.23 %       (1)    Allowance as a percentage of loans receivable is calculated based on the gross loans receivable for each respective category.    30    Table of Contents During the three months ended March 31, 2009, the allowance for loan losses increased by $120.2 million from the level at December 31, 2008. This increase was driven primarily by the increase in the allowance allocated to the one- to four-family loan portfolio, which began to deteriorate during 2008. However, the majority of the allowance as of March 31, 2009 related to the home equity portfolio, which began to deteriorate during the second half of 2007. We believe the deterioration in both of these portfolios was caused by several factors, including: home price depreciation in virtually all key markets; growing inventories of unsold homes; rising foreclosure rates; sustained contraction in the availability of credit; and a severe downturn in the economy. While we do believe the provision for loan losses will be at historically high levels in future periods, we do not expect those levels to be in excess of those incurred in the third and fourth quarters of 2008. Included in our allowance for loan losses at March 31, 2009 was a specific allowance of $62.5 million that was established for modified loans in which a significant economic concession was granted to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty (TDRs). The specific allowance for these individually impaired loans represents the expected loss over the remaining life of the loan.

Our policy is to charge-off closed-end consumer loans when the loan is 120 days delinquent or when we determine that collection is not probable. For credit cards, our policy is to charge-off loans when collection is not probable or the loan has been delinquent for 180 days. Our policy for both one- to four-family and home equity loans is to assess the value of the property when the loan has been delinquent for 180 days or is in bankruptcy, regardless of whether or not the     31    Table of Contents  property is in foreclosure, and charge-off the amount of the loan balance in excess of the estimated current property value.  Net charge-offs for the three months ended March 31, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 increased by $157.6 million. The overall increase was primarily due to higher net charge-offs on our one- to four-family loans and home equity loans, which were driven mainly by the same factors as described above. The continued pressure in the residential real estate market, specifically home price depreciation combined with tighter mortgage lending guidelines, could lead to a higher level of charge-offs in future periods. The following graph illustrates the net charge-offs by quarter:       32    Table of Contents Nonperforming Assets  We classify loans as nonperforming when they are 90 days past due. The following table shows the comparative data for nonperforming loans and assets (dollars in thousands):                    March 31,2009     December 31,2008     One- to four-family   $ 882,077     $ 593,075     Home equity     419,670       341,255     Consumer and other loans     9,113       7,792                       Total nonperforming loans     1,310,860       942,122     Real estate owned (“REO”) and other repossessed assets, net     86,962       108,105                       Total nonperforming assets, net   $ 1,397,822     $ 1,050,227                       Nonperforming loans receivable as a percentage of gross loans receivable     5.36 %     3.69 %   One- to four-family allowance for loan losses as a percentage of one- to four-family nonperforming loans     35.01 %     31.22 %   Home equity allowance for loan losses as a percentage of home equity nonperforming loans     195.07 %     244.34 %   Consumer and other allowance for loan losses as a percentage of consumer and other nonperforming loans     804.96 %     790.72 %   Total allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total nonperforming loans     91.60 %     114.70 %  During the three months ended March 31, 2009, our nonperforming assets, net increased $347.6 million to $1.4 billion compared to December 31, 2008. The increase was attributed primarily to an increase in nonperforming one- to four-family loans of $289.0 million and home equity loans of $78.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2009 when compared to December 31, 2008. We expect nonperforming loan levels to continue to increase over time due to the weak conditions in the residential real estate and credit markets.  The following graph illustrates the nonperforming loans by quarter:       33    Table of Contents The allowance as a percentage of total nonperforming loans receivable, net decreased from 115% at December 31, 2008 to 92% at March 31, 2009. This decrease was driven primarily by an increase in home equity nonperforming loans, which have a higher level of expected loss when compared to one- to four-family loans. The balance of nonperforming loans includes loans delinquent 90 to 179 days as well as loans delinquent 180 days and greater. We believe the distinction between these two periods is important as loans delinquent 180 days and greater have been written down to their expected recovery value, whereas loans delinquent 90 to 179 days have not. We believe the allowance for loan losses expressed as a percentage of loans delinquent 90 to 179 days is an important measure of the adequacy of the allowance as these loans are expected to drive the vast majority of future charge-offs. Additional charge-offs on loans delinquent 180 days are possible if home prices decline beyond our current expectations, but we do not anticipate these charge-offs to be significant, particularly when compared to the expected charge-offs on loans delinquent 90 to 179 days. We consider this ratio especially important for one- to four-family loans as we expect the balances of loans delinquent 180 days and greater to increase in the future due to the extensive amount of time it takes to foreclose on a property in the current real estate market.

We classify loans as special mention when they are between 30 and 89 days past due.

One- to four-family loans are generally secured, in a first lien position, by real estate assets, reducing the potential loss when compared to an unsecured loan. Our home equity loans are generally secured by real estate assets; however, the majority of these loans are secured in a second lien position, which substantially increases the potential loss when compared to a first lien position.  During the three months ended March 31, 2009, special mention loans decreased by $102.5 million to approximately $932.6 million. This decrease was almost entirely due to a decrease in home equity special mention loans. Approximately 30% of the decrease in home equity special mention loans was a result of our loan modification programs in which borrowers who were 30 to 89 days past due were made current(1) as part of a      (1)   TDRs are accounted for as nonaccrual loans at the time of modification and return to accrual status after six consecutive payments are made.    34    Table of Contents  loan modification that was considered a TDR. We believe that our loan modification programs will improve the overall credit performance of the modified loans over time; however, our current forecast of future loan losses does not assume that the modified loans will perform better than loans with the same characteristics and delinquency pattern. While our level of special mention loans can fluctuate significantly in any given period, we believe the decrease we observed in the first quarter of 2009 is an encouraging sign regarding the future credit performance of this portfolio.  The following graph illustrates the special mention loans by quarter:     Securities  We focus primarily on security type and credit rating to monitor credit risk in our securities portfolios. We believe our asset-backed securities portfolio, which we sold in the fourth quarter of 2007, represented our highest concentration of credit risk within the securities portfolio. Subsequent to the sale of that portfolio, we believe our highest concentration of remaining credit risk, while dramatically lower than the credit risk inherent in asset-backed securities, is our CMO portfolio.

As a result of the deterioration in the expected credit performance of the underlying loans in the securities, they were written down to their estimated fair market value by recording a $18.8 million impairment during the first quarter of 2009. Further declines in the performance of our CMO portfolio could result in additional impairments in future periods(1).  SUMMARY OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  The preparation of our financial condition and results of operations requires us to make judgments and estimates that may have a significant impact upon the financial results of the Company. We believe that of our significant accounting policies, the following require estimates and assumptions that require complex, subjective judgments by management, which can materially impact reported results: allowance for loan losses; fair value measurements; classification and valuation of certain investments; accounting for financial derivatives; estimates of effective tax rates, deferred taxes and valuation allowances; valuation of goodwill and other intangibles; and, valuation and expensing of share-based payments. These are more fully described in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008.  During the first quarter of 2009, our loan modification program became more active resulting in $115.7 million of TDRs. As a result, we updated our allowance for loan losses accounting policy to include our policy for TDRs.  Allowance for Loan Losses  Description  The allowance for loan losses is management’s estimate of credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date. In determining the adequacy of the allowance, we perform periodic evaluations of the loan portfolio and loss forecasting assumptions. At March 31, 2009, our allowance for loan losses was $1.2 billion on $24.3 billion of loans designated as held-for-investment.  Judgments  The estimate of the allowance is based on a variety of factors, including the composition and quality of the portfolio; delinquency levels and trends; current and historical charge-off and loss experience; current industry charge-off and loss experience; the condition of the real estate market and geographic concentrations within the      (1)   In the second quarter of 2009, we will adopt FSP No. FAS 115-2 and FAS 124-2 which amends the other-than-temporary impairment guidance in GAAP for debt securities. We expect the adoption of this standard to decrease the impact of impairments on our results of operations in future periods when compared to the impact we believe would have occurred without this new accounting standard. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of FSP No. FAS 115-2 and FAS 124-2 to our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.    36    Table of Contents  loan portfolio; the interest rate climate; the overall availability of housing credit; and general economic conditions. The allowance for loan losses is typically equal to management’s estimate of loan charge-offs in the twelve months following the balance sheet date. Determining the adequacy of the allowance is complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. We evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses by loan type: one- to four-family, home equity and consumer and other loan portfolios.  For loans that are not specifically identified for impairment under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 114, Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan-an amendment of FASB Statements No. 5 and 15 (“SFAS No. 114”), which includes TDRs, our allowance is assessed in accordance with SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies (“SFAS No. 5”). Our one- to four-family and home equity loan portfolios are separated into risk segments based on key risk factors, which include but are not limited to channel of loan origination, documentation type, loan product type and LTV ratio. Based upon the segmentation, probable losses are determined with expected loss rates in each segment. The additional protection provided by mortgage insurance and the credit default swap has been factored into the expected loss on defaulted mortgage loans. The expected recovery from the liquidation of foreclosed real estate and expected recoveries from loan sellers related to contractual guarantees are also factored into the expected loss on defaulted mortgage loans. Our one- to four-family and home equity loan portfolios represented 52% and 39%, respectively, of the total gross loan portfolio as of March 31, 2009.  For the consumer and other loan portfolio, management establishes loss estimates for each consumer portfolio based on credit characteristics and observation of the existing markets. The expected recoveries from the sale of repossessed collateral are factored into the expected loss on defaulted consumer loans based on current liquidation experience. Our consumer and other loan portfolio represented 9% of the total gross loan portfolio as of March 31, 2009.  In addition to the SFAS No. 5 allowance, we also establish a specific allowance for any modified loans that are involved in a TDR in accordance with SFAS No. 114. Under SFAS No. 114, we measure the impairment of a loan using a discounted cash flow analysis and a specific allowance is established to the extent that the investment recorded exceeds the discounted cash flows of a TDR.  Subsequent evaluations of the loan portfolio, in light of the factors then prevailing, may result in significant changes in the allowance for loan losses in future periods.  Effects if Actual Results Differ  The crisis in the residential real estate and credit markets has substantially increased the complexity and uncertainty involved in estimating the losses inherent in our loan portfolio. If our underlying assumptions and judgments prove to be inaccurate, the allowance for loan losses could be insufficient to cover actual losses. These losses would result in a decrease in our net income as well as a decrease in the level of regulatory capital at E*TRADE Bank.    37    Table of Contents GLOSSARY OF TERMS  Active Trader—The customer segment that includes those who execute 30 or more trades per quarter.

As such, these tax-exempt instruments typically yield lower returns than a taxable investment. To provide more meaningful comparison of yields and margins for all interest-earning assets, the interest income earned on tax exempt assets is increased to make it fully equivalent to interest income on other taxable investments. This adjustment is done for the analytic purposes in the net enterprise interest income/spread calculation and is not made on the consolidated statement loss, as that is not permitted under GAAP.  Tier 1 Capital—Adjusted equity capital used in the calculation of capital adequacy ratios at E*TRADE Bank as required by the OTS. Tier 1 capital equals: total shareholder’s equity at E*TRADE Bank, plus/(less) unrealized losses (gains) on available-for-sale securities and cash flow hedges, less deferred tax assets, goodwill and certain other intangible assets.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  The following discussion about our market risk disclosure includes forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including, but not limited to, those set forth in Item 1A. “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008 and as updated in this report. Market risk is our exposure to changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and equity and commodity prices. Our exposure to interest rate risk is related primarily to interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.  Interest Rate Risk  The management of interest rate risk is essential to profitability. Interest rate risk is our exposure to changes in interest rates. In general, we manage our interest rate risk by balancing variable-rate and fixed-rate assets and liabilities and we utilize derivatives in a way that reduces our overall exposure to changes in interest rates. In recent years, we have managed our interest rate risk to achieve a minimum to moderate risk profile with limited exposure to earnings volatility resulting from interest rate fluctuations. Exposure to interest rate risk requires management to make complex assumptions regarding maturities, market interest rates and customer behavior. Changes in interest rates, including the following, could impact interest income and expense:        •    Interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities may re-price at different times or by different amounts creating a mismatch.        •    The yield curve may flatten or change shape affecting the spread between short- and long-term rates. Widening or narrowing spreads could impact net interest income.        •    Market interest rates may influence prepayments resulting in maturity mismatches. In addition, prepayments could impact yields as premium and discounts amortize.  Exposure to market risk is dependent upon the distribution and composition of interest-earning assets, interest-bearing liabilities and derivatives. The differing risk characteristics of each product are managed to mitigate our exposure to interest rate fluctuations. At March 31, 2009, 93% of our total assets were enterprise interest-earning assets.  At March 31, 2009, approximately 69% of our total assets were residential real estate loans and available-for-sale mortgage-backed securities. The values of these assets are sensitive to changes in interest rates, as well as expected prepayment levels. As interest rates increase, fixed rate residential mortgages and mortgage-backed securities tend to exhibit lower prepayments. The inverse is true in a falling rate environment.  When real estate loans prepay, unamortized premiums are written off. Depending on the timing of the prepayment, the write-offs of unamortized premiums may result in lower than anticipated yields. E*TRADE Bank’s Asset Liability Committee (“ALCO”) reviews estimates of the impact of changing market rates on prepayments. This information is incorporated into our interest rate risk management strategy.  Our liability structure consists of two central sources of funding: deposits and wholesale borrowings. Cash provided to us through deposits is the primary source of our funding. Our key deposit products include sweep accounts, money market and savings accounts and certificates of deposit. Our wholesale borrowings include securities sold under agreements to repurchase and other borrowings. Customer payables, which represents customer cash contained within our broker-dealers, is an additional source of funding. In addition, the parent company has issued a significant amount of corporate debt.  Our deposit accounts and customer payables tend to be less rate-sensitive than wholesale borrowings. Agreements to repurchase securities re-price as interest rates change. Sweep, money market and savings accounts re-price at management’s discretion. Certificates of deposit re-price over time depending on maturities. FHLB advances and corporate debt generally have fixed rates.    42    Table of Contents Derivative Financial Instruments  We use derivative financial instruments to help manage our interest rate risk. Interest rate swaps involve the exchange of fixed-rate and variable-rate interest payments between two parties based on a contractual underlying notional amount, but do not involve the exchange of the underlying notional amounts. Option products are utilized primarily to decrease the market value changes resulting from the prepayment dynamics of the mortgage portfolio, as well as to protect against increases in funding costs. The types of options employed include Cap Options (“Caps”) and Floor Options (“Floors”), “Payor Swaptions” and “Receiver Swaptions.” Caps mitigate the market risk associated with increases in interest rates while Floors mitigate the risk associated with decreases in market interest rates. Similarly, Payor and Receiver Swaptions mitigate the market risk associated with the respective increases and decreases in interest rates. See derivative financial instruments discussion at Note 6—Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities in Item 1. Consolidated Financial Statements.  Scenario Analysis  Scenario analysis is an advanced approach to estimating interest rate risk exposure. Under the NPVE approach, the present value of all existing assets, liabilities, derivatives and forward commitments are estimated and then combined to produce a NPVE figure. The sensitivity of this value to changes in interest rates is then determined by applying alternative interest rate scenarios, which include, but are not limited to, instantaneous parallel shifts up 100, 200 and 300 basis points and down 100 and 200 basis points. The NPVE method is used at the E*TRADE Bank level and not for the Company.  E*TRADE Bank has 98% of our enterprise interest-earning assets at both March 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, and holds 98% of our enterprise interest-bearing liabilities at both March 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008. The sensitivity of NPVE at March 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008 and the limits established by E*TRADE Bank’s Board of Directors are listed below (dollars in thousands):                             Change in NPVE      Board Limit      Parallel Change in Interest Rates (basis points)   March 31, 2009     December 31, 2008         Amount       Percentage       Amount       Percentage       +300   $ (336,542 )   (15 )%   $ (65,600 )   (3 )%   (55 )%  +200   $ (67,816 )   (3 )%   $ 68,853     3 %   (30 )%  +100   $ 63,968     3 %   $ 119,407     5 %   (20 )%  -100   $ (277,789 )   (12 )%   $ (334,132 )   (14 )%   (20 )%  -200(1)   $ —      —  %   $ —      —  %   (30 )%       (1)    On March 31, 2009, the yield on the three-month Treasury bill was 0.21%. As a result, the OTS temporarily modified the requirements of the NPV Model, resulting in removal of the minus 200 basis points scenario for the periods ended March 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008.  Under criteria published by the OTS, E*TRADE Bank’s overall interest rate risk exposure at March 31, 2009 was characterized as “minimum.” We actively manage our interest rate risk positions. As interest rates change, we will re-adjust our strategy and mix of assets, liabilities and derivatives to optimize our position. For example, a 100 basis points increase in rates may not result in a change in value as indicated above. The ALCO monitors E*TRADE Bank’s interest rate risk position.    43    Table of Contents Other Market Risk  Equity Security Risk  Equity securities risk is the risk of potential loss from investing in public and private equity securities including foreign currency exchange risk. We hold equity securities for corporate investment purposes and in trading securities for market-making purposes. The foreign currency exchange risk associated with these investments is not material to the Company. For corporate investment purposes, we currently hold publicly traded equity securities, in which we had an estimated fair value of $0.5 million as of March 31, 2009.

See accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements    50    Table of Contents E*TRADE FINANCIAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)  NOTE 1—ORGANIZATION, BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  Organization—E*TRADE Financial Corporation is a financial services company that provides online brokerage and related products and services primarily to individual investors under the brand “E*TRADE Financial.” Our products and services include investor-focused banking, primarily sweep deposits and savings products and asset gathering.  Basis of Presentation—The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its majority-owned subsidiaries. Entities in which the Company holds at least a 20% ownership or in which there are other indicators of significant influence are generally accounted for by the equity method. Entities in which the Company holds less than 20% ownership and does not have the ability to exercise significant influence are generally carried at cost. Intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. The Company evaluates investments including joint ventures, low income housing tax credit partnerships and other limited partnerships to determine if the Company is required to consolidate the entities under the guidance of FASB Interpretation No. 46 revised, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities-an interpretation of ARB No. 51.  Certain prior period items in these consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. The operations of certain businesses have been accounted for as discontinued operations in accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. Accordingly, results of operations from prior periods have been reclassified to discontinued operations. Unless noted, discussions herein pertain to the Company’s continuing operations. These consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, which are all normal and recurring in nature, necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented, and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of E*TRADE Financial Corporation included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008.  The Company reports corporate interest income and corporate interest expense separately from operating interest income and operating interest expense. The Company believes reporting these two items separately provides a clearer picture of the financial performance of the Company’s operations than would a presentation that combined these two items. Operating interest income and operating interest expense is generated from the operations of the Company. Corporate debt, which is the primary source of the corporate interest expense, has been issued primarily in connection with the Citadel Investment and past acquisitions, such as Harrisdirect and BrownCo.  Similarly, the Company reports gain (loss) on sales of investments, net separately from gain (loss) on loans and securities, net. The Company believes reporting these two items separately provides a clearer picture of the financial performance of its operations than would a presentation that combined these two items. Gain (loss) on loans and securities, net is the result of activities in the Company’s operations, namely its balance sheet management segment, including impairment on its available-for-sale mortgage-backed and investment securities portfolio. Gain (loss) on sales of investments, net relates to historical equity investments of the Company at the corporate level and are not related to the ongoing business of the Company’s operating subsidiaries.  Use of Estimates—The consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with GAAP, which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and related notes for the periods presented. Actual results could differ from management’s estimates. Material estimates in which management believes near-term changes could reasonably occur include allowance for loan losses; fair value measurements; classification and valuation of certain investments; accounting for financial derivatives; estimates of effective tax rates, deferred taxes and valuation allowances; valuation of goodwill and other intangibles; and valuation and expensing of share-based payments.    51    Table of Contents Financial Statement Descriptions and Related Accounting Policies—Financial statement descriptions and related accounting policies are more fully described in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008. Below are descriptions and accounting policies for certain of the Company’s financial statement categories as updated in this report.  Margin Receivables—At March 31, 2009, the fair value of securities that the Company received as collateral in connection with margin receivables and stock borrowing activities, where the Company is permitted to sell or re-pledge the securities, was approximately $3.4 billion. Of this amount, $1.0 billion had been pledged or sold at March 31, 2009 in connection with securities loans, bank borrowings and deposits with clearing organizations.  Loans, Net—Loans, net consists of real estate and consumer loans that management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity, also known as loans held for investment. Loans that are held for investment are carried at amortized cost adjusted for charge-offs, net, allowance for loan losses, deferred fees or costs on originated loans and unamortized premiums or discounts on purchased loans. Loan fees and certain direct loan origination costs are deferred and the net fee or cost is recognized in operating interest income using the interest method over the contractual life of the loans. Premiums and discounts on purchased loans are amortized or accreted into income using the interest method over the remaining period to contractual maturity and adjusted for actual prepayments. Modified loans in which a significant economic concession was granted to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty are considered TDRs in accordance with SFAS No. 15, Accounting by Debtors and Creditors for Troubled Debt Restructurings.  The Company classifies loans as nonperforming when full and timely collection of interest or principal becomes uncertain or when they are 90 days past due. TDRs are accounted for as nonaccrual loans at the time of modification and return to accrual status after six consecutive payments are made. Interest previously accrued, but not collected, is reversed against current income when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status and is considered nonperforming. Accretion of deferred fees is discontinued for nonperforming loans. Payments received on nonperforming loans are recognized as interest income when the loan is considered collectible and applied to principal when it is doubtful that full payment will be collected.  The Company’s charge-off policy for both one- to four-family and home equity loans is to assess the value of the property when the loans has been delinquent for 180 days or it is in bankruptcy, regardless of whether or not the property is in foreclosure, and charge-off the amount of the loan balance in excess of the estimated current property value. Credit cards are charged-off when collection is not probable or the loan has been delinquent for 180 days. Consumer loans are charged-off when the loan has been delinquent for 120 days or when it is determined that collection is not probable.  Allowance for Loan Losses—The allowance for loan losses is management’s estimate of credit losses inherent in the Company’s loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date.  For loans that are not specifically identified for impairment under SFAS No. 114, the allowance is assessed in accordance with SFAS No. 5. The estimate of the allowance for loan losses is based on a variety of factors, including the composition and quality of the portfolio; delinquency levels and trends; current and historical charge-off and loss experience; current industry charge-off and loss experience; the condition of the real estate market and geographic concentrations within the loan portfolio; the interest rate climate; the overall availability of housing credit; and general economic conditions. The Company’s one- to four-family and home equity loan portfolios are separated into risk segments based on key risk factors, which include but are not limited to channel of loan origination, documentation type, loan product type and LTV ratio. Based upon the segmentation, probable losses are determined with expected loss rates in each segment. The additional protection provided by mortgage insurance and the credit default swap has been factored into the expected loss on defaulted mortgage loans. The expected recovery from the liquidation of foreclosed real estate and expected recoveries from loan sellers related to contractual guarantees are also factored into the expected loss on defaulted mortgage loans. For     52    Table of Contents  the consumer and other loan portfolio, management establishes loss estimates for each consumer portfolio based on credit characteristics and observation of the existing markets. The expected recoveries from the sale of repossessed collateral are factored into the expected loss on defaulted consumer loans based on current liquidation experience. Loan losses are charged and recoveries are credited to the allowance for loan losses. The allowance for loan losses is typically equal to management’s estimate of loan charge-offs in the twelve months following the balance sheet date. Management believes this level is representative of probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date.  For modified loans accounted for as TDRs, the Company establishes a specific allowance in accordance with SFAS No. 114. Under SFAS No. 114, the impairment of a loan is measured using a discounted cash flow analysis. A specific allowance is established to the extent that the recorded investment exceeds the discounted cash flows of a TDR with a corresponding charge to the provision for loan losses. The specific allowance for these individually impaired loans represents the expected loss over the remaining life of the loan, including the economic concession to the borrower.  Determining the adequacy of the allowance is complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Subsequent evaluations of the loan portfolio, in light of the factors then prevailing, may result in significant changes in the allowance for loan losses in future periods.  New Accounting Standards—Below are the new accounting pronouncements that relate to activities in which the Company is engaged.  SFAS No. 161—Disclosures About Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities  In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, Disclosures About Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (“SFAS No. 161”). This statement establishes, among other things, the disclosure requirements for derivative instruments and hedging activities. This statement is effective at the beginning of an entity’s first interim period beginning after November 15, 2008, or January 1, 2009 for the Company. The Company’s disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities in the first quarter of 2009 reflect the adoption of this statement. For additional information regarding the adoption of this statement, see Note 6—Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities.  FSP No. FAS 141R-1—Accounting for Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed in a Business Combination That Arise from Contingencies  In April 2009, the FASB issued FSP No. 141R-1, Accounting for Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed in a Business Combination That Arise from Contingencies (“FSP No. 141R-1”). FSP No. 141R-1 amends and clarifies SFAS No. 141R, Business Combinations, to address application issues raised by preparers, auditors, and members of the legal profession on initial recognition and measurement, subsequent measurement and accounting, and disclosure of assets and liabilities arising from contingencies in a business combination. FSP No. 141R-1 is effective for assets or liabilities arising from contingencies in business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008, or January 1, 2009 for the Company and had no impact on its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.  FSP No. FAS 107-1 and APB 28-1—Interim Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments  In April 2009, the FASB issued FSP No. FAS 107-1 and APB 28-1, Interim Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments (“FSP No. FAS 107-1 and APB 28-1”). FSP No. FAS 107-1 and APB 28-1 amends FASB Statement No. 107, Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments, to require disclosures about fair value of financial instruments for interim reporting periods of publicly traded companies as well as in annual financial statements. FSP No. FAS 107-1 and APB 28-1 is effective for interim reporting periods ending after     53    Table of Contents  June 15, 2009, or June 30, 2009 for the Company, with early adoption permitted. The Company did not early adopt this FSP. The Company’s disclosures about fair value of financial instruments will reflect the adoption of this FSP in the second quarter of 2009.  FSP No. FAS 115-2 and FAS 124-2—Recognition and Presentation of Other-Than-Temporary Impairments  In April 2009, the FASB issued FSP No. FAS 115-2 and FAS 124-2. FSP No. FAS 115-2 and FAS 124-2 amends the other-than-temporary impairment guidance in GAAP for debt securities and the presentation and disclosure requirements of other-than-temporary impairments on debt and equity securities in the financial statements. This FSP does not amend existing recognition and measurement guidance related to other-than-temporary impairments of equity securities. FSP No. FAS 115-2 and FAS 124-2 is effective for interim reporting periods ending after June 15, 2009, or June 30, 2009 for the Company, with early adoption permitted. The Company did not early adopt this FSP. The Company expects the adoption of this standard to decrease the impact of impairments on its results of operations in future periods when compared to the impact the Company believes would have occurred without this new accounting standard. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of FSP No. FAS 115-2 and FAS 124-2 to its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  FSP No. FAS 157-4—Determining Fair Value When the Volume and Level of Activity for the Asset or Liability Have Significantly Decreased and Identifying Transactions That Are Not Orderly  In April 2009, the FASB issued FSP No. FAS 157-4, Determining Fair Value When the Volume and Level of Activity for the Asset or Liability Have Significantly Decreased and Identifying Transactions That Are Not Orderly (“FSP No. FAS 157-4”). FSP No. FAS 157-4 provides additional guidance for estimating fair value in accordance with SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (“SFAS No. 157”), when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased. FSP No. FAS 157-4 also includes guidance on identifying circumstances that indicate a transaction is not orderly. FSP No. FAS 157-4 is effective for interim reporting periods ending after June 15, 2009, or June 30, 2009 for the Company, with early adoption permitted. The Company did not early adopt this FSP. The Company does not expect the adoption of FSP No. FAS 157-4 to have a material impact on its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

In determining fair value, the Company may use various valuation approaches, including market, income and/or cost approaches. The fair value hierarchy established in SFAS No. 157 requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Fair value is a market-based measure considered from the perspective of a market participant. As such, even when market assumptions are not readily available, the Company’s own assumptions reflect those that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. The standard describes the following three levels used to classify fair value measurements:        •    Level 1—Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.        •    Level 2—Quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly.        •    Level 3—Unobservable inputs that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.  The availability of observable inputs can vary and in certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, the level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The Company’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to a fair value measurement requires judgment and consideration of factors specific to the asset or liability.  Recurring Fair Value Measurement Valuation Techniques  Mortgage-backed Securities Backed by U.S. Government Sponsored and Federal Agencies  Mortgage-backed securities backed by U.S. Government sponsored and federal agencies include TBA securities and mortgage pass-through certificates. The fair value of mortgage-backed securities backed by U.S. Government sponsored and federal agencies is determined using quoted market prices, recent market transactions and spread data for similar instruments. Mortgage-backed securities backed by U.S. Government sponsored and federal agencies are generally categorized in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.  Collateralized Mortgage Obligations   CMOs, generally non-agency mortgage-backed securities, are typically valued using market observable data, when available, including recent external market transactions for similar instruments. The Company also utilized a pricing service to corroborate the market observability of the Company’s inputs used in the fair value measurements. The valuations of CMOs reflect the Company’s best estimate of what market participants would consider in pricing the financial instruments. The Company considers the price transparency for these financial instruments to be a key determinant of the degree of judgment involved in determining the fair value. As of March 31, 2009, the majority of the Company’s CMOs were categorized in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.  Investment Securities  As of March 31, 2009, investment securities included municipal bonds and corporate bonds. For municipal bonds, the Company utilized recent market transactions for identical or similar bonds to corroborate pricing service fair value measurements. Municipal bonds are generally categorized in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of corporate bonds is estimated using market price quotes corroborated by recently executed transactions observable in the market. Corporate bonds are generally categorized in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.    55    Table of Contents Derivative Financial Instruments  The majority of the Company’s derivative financial instruments, interest rate swap and option contracts, are valued with pricing models commonly used by the financial services industry using market observable pricing inputs. The Company does not consider these models to involve significant judgment on the part of management and corroborated the fair value measurements with counterparty valuations. The majority of the Company’s derivative financial instruments are categorized in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The consideration of credit risk, the Company’s or the counterparty’s, did not result in an adjustment to the valuation of its derivative financial instruments in the periods presented.  U.S. Treasuries  The fair value of U.S. Treasuries is based on quoted market prices in active markets. U.S. Treasuries are classified as Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.  Securities Owned and Securities Sold, Not Yet Purchased  Securities transactions entered into by certain broker-dealer subsidiaries are included in trading securities and securities sold, not yet purchased in the Company’s SFAS No. 157 disclosures. For equity securities, the Company’s definition of actively traded is based on average daily volume and other market trading statistics. The fair value of securities owned and securities sold, not yet purchased is determined using listed or quoted market prices and are generally categorized in Level 1 or Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.  Servicing Rights  The Company accounts for servicing rights under the fair value measurement method. The fair value of the servicing rights is determined using models that include observable inputs, if available. To the extent observable inputs are not available, the Company estimates fair value based on the present value of expected future cash flows using its best estimate of the key assumptions, including anticipated loan prepayments and discount rates. Servicing rights are categorized as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy when unobservable inputs are significant to the fair value measurements.    56    Table of Contents Recurring Fair Value Measurements  Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below (dollars in thousands):                        Level 1   Level 2   Level 3   Fair Value   March 31, 2009:                   Assets                   Trading securities   $ 2,410   $ 13,256   $ 30,643   $ 46,309                             Available-for-sale securities:                   Mortgage-backed securities     —      11,201,313     524,245     11,725,558   Investment securities     —      97,671     163     97,834                             Total available-for-sale securities     —      11,298,984     524,408     11,823,392                             Other assets:                   Derivative assets     —      127,818     —      127,818   Deposits with clearing organizations(1)      25,000     —      —      25,000   Servicing rights     —      —      6,048     6,048                             Total other assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis     25,000     127,818     6,048     158,866                             Total assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis(2)   $ 27,410   $ 11,440,058   $ 561,099   $ 12,028,567                             Liabilities                   Derivative liabilities   $ —    $ 326,462   $ 500   $ 326,962   Securities sold, not yet purchased     2,140     5,820     —      7,960                             Total liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis(2)   $ 2,140   $ 332,282   $ 500   $ 334,922                                      Level 1   Level 2   Level 3   Fair Value   December 31, 2008:                   Assets                   Trading securities   $ 2,363   $ 19,712   $ 33,406   $ 55,481                             Available-for-sale securities:                   Mortgage-backed securities     —      10,408,528     304,661     10,713,189   Investment securities     —      92,735     170     92,905                             Total available-for-sale securities     —      10,501,263     304,831     10,806,094                             Other assets:                   Derivative assets     —      137,308     8     137,316   Deposits with clearing organizations(3)      28,000     11,659     —      39,659   Servicing rights     —      —      6,478     6,478                             Total other assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis     28,000     148,967     6,486     183,453                             Total assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis(4)   $ 30,363   $ 10,669,942   $ 344,723   $ 11,045,028                             Liabilities                   Derivative liabilities   $ —    $ 484,681   $ 500   $ 485,181   Securities sold, not yet purchased     1,844     4,926     —      6,770                             Total liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis(4)   $ 1,844   $ 489,607   $ 500   $ 491,951                                 (1)    As of March 31, 2009, deposits with clearing organizations includes U.S. Treasuries deposited with clearing organizations by broker-dealer subsidiaries.

(3)    Represents derivative assets net of derivative liabilities for presentation purposes only.  Level 3 Assets and Liabilities  Level 3 assets and liabilities included instruments whose value is determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation. As of March 31, 2009, 1% of the Company’s total assets and less than 1% of total liabilities represented instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis categorized as Level 3.  In general, level classification transfers in and out of Level 3 during the three months ended March 31, 2009 were driven by changes in price transparency in the CMO market during the period. The Company’s transfers in     58    Table of Contents  and out of Level 3 are as of the beginning of the reporting period on a quarterly basis. While the Company’s fair value estimates of Level 3 instruments as of March 31, 2009 utilized observable inputs where available, the valuation included significant management judgment in determining the relevance and reliability of market information considered and the financial instruments were therefore classified as Level 3.  Level 3 assets as of March 31, 2009 included $276.5 million of CMOs classified as Level 2 on December 31, 2008. The $18.8 million CMO impairment recorded for the three months ended March 31, 2009 related to CMOs classified as Level 3 as of March 31, 2009. Of the $18.8 million CMO impairment recorded during the three months ended March 31, 2009, $14.3 million related to CMOs transferred into Level 3 in the first quarter of 2009. The $26.6 million CMO impairment recorded for the three months ended March 31, 2008 related to CMOs classified as Level 3 as of March 31, 2008.  Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements  Financial Instruments  The Company also measures certain other financial instruments at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in accordance with GAAP. The Company’s charge-off policy for both one- to four-family and home equity loans is to assess the value of the property when the loan has been delinquent for 180 days or it is in bankruptcy, regardless of whether or not the property is in foreclosure, and charge-off the amount of the loan balance in excess of the estimated current property value. The Company classified these fair value measurements, approximately $327 million and $61 million for the three months ended March 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, as Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy as the valuations included Level 3 inputs that were significant to the estimate of fair value. These fair value measurements resulted in $107.6 million and $30.0 million of charge-offs for the three months ended March 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.  Nonfinancial Instruments  The Company measures certain nonfinancial instruments at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in accordance with GAAP. The Company adopted certain provisions of SFAS No. 157 on January 1, 2009 as they relate to nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are not recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. Included in the other assets line item in the consolidated balance sheet is real estate acquired through foreclosure which is recorded at the lower of carrying value or fair value, less estimated selling costs. The Company classified these fair value measurements, approximately $73 million for the three months ended March 31, 2009, as Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy as the majority of the valuations included Level 3 inputs that were significant to the estimate of fair value. These fair value measurements resulted in $15.9 million in write-downs for the three months ended March 31, 2009.    59    Table of Contents NOTE 4—AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE MORTGAGE-BACKED AND INVESTMENT SECURITIES  The amortized cost basis and estimated fair values of available-for-sale mortgage-backed and investment securities are shown in the following tables (dollars in thousands):                         AmortizedCost   GrossUnrealized Gains   GrossUnrealized Losses     EstimatedFair Values   March 31, 2009:                    Mortgage-backed securities:                    Backed by U.S. Government sponsored and federal agencies   $ 11,114,704   $ 99,195   $ (50,163 )   $ 11,163,736   CMOs and other     869,315     2,875     (310,368 )     561,822                               Total mortgage-backed securities     11,984,019     102,070     (360,531 )     11,725,558                               Investment securities:                    Debt securities:                    Municipal bonds     100,712     —      (12,380 )     88,332   Corporate bonds     25,420     1     (16,441 )     8,980                               Total debt securities     126,132     1     (28,821 )     97,312   Publicly traded equity securities:                    Corporate investments     163     359     —        522                               Total investment securities     126,295     360     (28,821 )     97,834                               Total available-for-sale securities   $ 12,110,314   $ 102,430   $ (389,352 )   $ 11,823,392                               December 31, 2008:                    Mortgage-backed securities:                    Backed by U.S. Government sponsored and federal agencies   $ 10,115,865   $ 82,663   $ (87,715 )   $ 10,110,813   CMOs and other     920,474     14     (318,112 )     602,376                               Total mortgage-backed securities     11,036,339     82,677     (405,827 )     10,713,189                               Investment securities:                    Debt securities:                    Municipal bonds     100,706     1     (21,101 )     79,606   Corporate bonds     25,454     14     (12,667 )     12,801                               Total debt securities     126,160     15     (33,768 )     92,407   Publicly traded equity securities:                    Corporate investments     532     285     (319 )     498                               Total investment securities     126,692     300     (34,087 )     92,905                               Total available-for-sale securities   $ 11,163,031   $ 82,977   $ (439,914 )   $ 10,806,094                                60    Table of Contents Other-Than-Temporary Impairment of Investments  The following tables show the fair values and unrealized losses on investments, aggregated by investment category, and the length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position (dollars in thousands):                                 Less than 12 Months     12 Months or More     Total        FairValues   UnrealizedLosses     FairValues   UnrealizedLosses     FairValues   UnrealizedLosses     March 31, 2009:                              Mortgage-backed securities:                              Backed by U.S. Government sponsored and federal agencies   $ 399,633   $ (1,094 )   $ 2,894,677   $ (49,069 )   $ 3,294,310   $ (50,163 )   CMOs and other     62,217     (41,166 )     442,127     (269,202 )     504,344     (310,368 )   Debt securities:                              Municipal bonds     —      —        88,321     (12,380 )     88,321     (12,380 )   Corporate bonds     24     (2 )     8,928     (16,439 )     8,952     (16,441 )                                               Total temporarily impaired securities   $ 461,874   $ (42,262 )   $ 3,434,053   $ (347,090 )   $ 3,895,927   $ (389,352 )                                               December 31, 2008:                              Mortgage-backed securities:                              Backed by U.S. Government sponsored and federal agencies   $ 1,050,268   $ (9,255 )   $ 3,157,773   $ (78,460 )   $ 4,208,041   $ (87,715 )   CMOs and other     53,836     (40,668 )     522,313     (277,444 )     576,149     (318,112 )   Debt securities:                              Municipal bonds     —      —        79,595     (21,101 )     79,595     (21,101 )   Corporate bonds     39     (4 )     12,719     (12,663 )     12,758     (12,667 )   Publicly traded equity securities:                              Corporate investments     —      —        43     (319 )     43     (319 )                                               Total temporarily impaired securities   $ 1,104,143   $ (49,927 )   $ 3,772,443   $ (389,987 )   $ 4,876,586   $ (439,914 )                                              The Company does not believe that any individual unrealized loss in the available-for-sale portfolio as of March 31, 2009 represents an other-than-temporary impairment. The majority of the unrealized losses on mortgage-backed securities are attributable to changes in interest rates and a re-pricing of risk in the market. Substantially all mortgage-backed securities backed by U.S. Government sponsored and federal agencies are AAA-rated. Municipal bonds and corporate bonds are evaluated by reviewing the credit-worthiness of the issuer and general market conditions. The Company has the intent and ability to hold the securities in an unrealized loss position at March 31, 2009 until the market value recovers or the securities mature(1).  Within the securities portfolio, the highest concentration of credit risk is the CMO portfolio. As of March 31, 2009, the Company concluded that approximately $37.3 million of these securities had a probable risk of future loss as a result of deterioration in the expected credit performance of the underlying loans in the securities. These securities were written down to their estimated fair market value by recording $18.8 million       (1)    In the second quarter of 2009, the Company will adopt FSP No. FAS 115-2 and FAS 124-2 which amends the other-than-temporary impairment guidance in GAAP for debt securities. The Company expects the adoption of this standard to decrease the impact of impairments on its results of operations in future periods when compared to the impact the Company believes would have occurred without this new accounting standard. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of FSP No. FAS 115-2 and FAS 124-2 to its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.    61    Table of Contents  impairment during the three months ended March 31, 2009. The Company recorded other-than-temporary impairment charges of $26.6 million for CMO securities for the three months ended March 31, 2008.  Our intent to hold securities in an unrealized loss position at March 31, 2009 until the market value recovers or the securities mature was based on the facts and circumstances that existed as of that date. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (the “Act”) was signed into law on October 3, 2008. This Act grants the Treasury authority to purchase troubled assets from financial institutions under the TARP. A new administration came into office and a new Treasury Secretary was named. On March 23, 2009, the new administration announced a new “Public-Private Investment Program” to address the problem of troubled real estate-related assets on banks’ balance sheets. Under the program, the Treasury will work with private investors to establish funds that purchase both loans and securities from financial institutions allowing them to cleanse their balance sheets of what are often referred to as “legacy” assets. The Company does not yet know enough about how this program will be implemented and most importantly the Company does not yet know enough about the prices at which banks’ troubled assets would be sold to these funds to determine if it would be of interest to the Company. Therefore the Company cannot make an assessment of whether the Treasury’s plans under the Act will impact the Company’s intent with respect to these securities and its loans in future periods. The Company’s ability and intent to hold securities in an unrealized loss position at March 31, 2009 until the market value recovers or the securities mature was based on these facts.

As of March 31, 2009, the balance of the loans covered by the CDS was $2.7 billion. A CDS provides, for a fee, an assumption by a third party of a portion of the credit risk related to the underlying loans. The CDS provides protection for losses in excess of $4.0 million, but not to exceed approximately $30.3 million. In addition, the Company’s regulatory risk-weighted assets were reduced as a result of this transaction because the Company transferred a portion of its credit risk to an unaffiliated third party. The Company recognized $1.4 million in losses on the portion of the loans covered under the CDS during the three months ended March 31, 2009 and $3.0 million in losses since we entered the CDS. The Company has not yet realized any recoveries from the CDS as losses on the covered loans have not yet exceeded $4.0 million; however, the estimated recoveries from the CDS for the next twelve months were $27.3 million at March 31, 2009, which is reflected in the allowance for loan losses.  In 2008 and continuing into the beginning of 2009, the Company initiated a loan modification program with a goal of avoiding foreclosure, primarily for loans that are nonperforming. As part of the program, the Company considers modifications in which it made a significant economic concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty a TDR. The Company has also modified a small number of loans in which it did not make a significant economic concession to the borrower.    63    Table of Contents Included in our allowance for loan losses at March 31, 2009 was a specific allowance of $62.5 million that was established for TDRs. The specific allowance for these individually impaired loans represents the expected loss over the remaining life of the loan, including the economic concession to the borrower. The following table shows detailed information related to the Company’s modified loans accounted for as TDRs as of and for the three months March 31, 2009 (dollars in thousands):                     RecordedInvestmentin TDRs(1)   SpecificValuationAllowance   Specific ValuationAllowance as a % ofTDR Loans     March 31, 2009                 One- to four-family   $ 45,241   $ 10,498   23 %   Home equity     70,456     52,049   74 %                     Total(2)   $ 115,697   $ 62,547   54 %                         (1)    For the three months ended March 31, 2009, the average recorded investment in TDR loans was $115.5 million and the interest income recognized on these loans was $0.6 million.     (2)    At March 31, 2009, $109.6 million TDRs had an associated specific valuation allowance and $6.1 million did not have an associated valuation allowance.    64    Table of Contents NOTE 6—ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES  The Company enters into derivative transactions primarily to protect against interest rate risk on the value of certain assets, liabilities and future cash flows. Financial derivative instruments designated in hedging relationships that mitigate the exposure to the variability in expected future cash flows or other forecasted transactions are considered cash flow hedges. Financial derivative instruments in hedging relationships that mitigate exposure to changes in the fair value of assets or liabilities are considered fair value hedges under SFAS No. 133, as amended. The Company is also required to recognize certain contracts and commitments as derivatives when the characteristics of those contracts and commitments meet the definition of a derivative as promulgated by SFAS No. 133, as amended. Each derivative is recorded on the balance sheet at fair value as a freestanding asset or liability. Cash flow and fair value ineffectiveness is re-measured on a quarterly basis. The following table summarizes the location and fair value amounts of derivative instruments reported in the consolidated balance sheet in accordance with the Company’s adoption of SFAS No. 161 on January 1, 2009 (dollars in thousands):                       Fair Value        Asset(1)   Liability(2)     Net     March 31, 2009                   Derivatives designated as hedging instruments under SFAS No. 133, as amended:                 Interest rate contracts                 Cash flow hedges   $ 93,343   $ (315,661 )   $ (222,318 )   Fair value hedges     19,747     —        19,747     Other derivatives     2,773     —        2,773                             Total derivatives designated as hedging instruments under SFAS No. 133, as amended     115,863     (315,661 )     (199,798 )                           Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments under SFAS No. 133, as amended:                 Interest rate contracts     11,808     (10,801 )     1,007     Other derivatives     147     (500 )     (353 )                           Total derivatives not designated as hedging instruments under SFAS No. 133, as amended     11,955     (11,301 )     654                             Total derivative instruments   $ 127,818   $ (326,962 )   $ (199,144 )                               (1)    Reflected in the other assets line item on the consolidated balance sheet.     (2)    Reflected in the accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities line item on the consolidated balance sheet.  Cash Flow Hedges  The majority of the Company’s derivative instruments as of March 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008 were designated as cash flow hedges. These hedges, which include a combination of interest rate swaps, forward-starting swaps and purchased options on caps and floors, are used primarily to reduce the variability of future cash flows associated with existing variable-rate liabilities and assets and forecasted issuances of liabilities.  The effective portion of changes in fair value of the financial derivative instruments that hedge cash flows is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax in the consolidated balance sheet, for both active and terminated hedges. Amounts are then included in net operating interest income as a yield adjustment in the same period the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. The ineffective portion of the change in fair value of the financial derivative is reported as fair value adjustments of financial derivatives in the gain (loss) on loans and securities, net line item in the consolidated statement of loss.    65    Table of Contents If it becomes probable that a hedged forecasted transaction will not occur, amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to the specific hedging instruments would be reclassified into the gain (loss) on loans and securities, net line item in the consolidated statement of loss. If hedge accounting is discontinued because a financial derivative instrument ceases to be a highly effective hedge; or is sold, terminated or de-designated, amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to the specific hedging instrument continue to be reported in other comprehensive income or loss until the forecasted transaction affects earnings. Financial derivative instruments no longer in hedging relationships continue to be recorded at fair value with changes in fair value being reported in the gain (loss) on loans and securities, net line item in the consolidated statement of loss.  The future issuances of liabilities, including repurchase agreements, are largely dependent on the market demand and liquidity in the wholesale borrowings market. As of March 31, 2009, the Company believes the forecasted issuance of all debt in cash flow hedge relationships is probable. However, unexpected changes in market conditions in future periods could impact the ability to issue this debt. The Company believes the forecasted issuance of debt in the form of repurchase agreements is most susceptible to an unexpected change in market conditions.

As of March 31, 2009, the fair value of forward contracts accounted for as cash flow hedges included in the derivative assets line item was $2.8 million.  The following table shows: 1) amounts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to derivative instruments accounted for as cash flow hedges; 2) amount of ineffectiveness recorded in earnings related to derivative instruments accounted for as cash flow hedges; 3) the notional amounts and fair values of derivatives terminated for the periods presented; and 4) the amortization of terminated interest rate swaps and options included in net operating interest income (dollars in thousands):                    Three Months EndedMarch 31,        2009     2008     Impact on accumulated other comprehensive loss (net of tax):             Beginning balance   $ (417,489 )   $ (132,223 )   Unrealized gain (loss), net     35,382       (78,157 )   Reclassifications into earnings, net     6,817       2,393                       Ending balance   $ (375,290 )   $ (207,987 )                     Cash flow hedge ineffectiveness(1)(2)    $ (50 )   $ (84 )       Derivatives terminated during the period:             Notional   $ 790,000     $ 1,590,000     Fair value of net losses recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss   $ (95,522 )   $ (76,034 )   Amortization of terminated interest rate swaps and options included in net operating interest income   $ (8,824 )   $ (688 )       (1)    The amount of ineffectiveness recorded in earnings for cash flow hedges is equal to the excess of the cumulative change in the fair value of the actual derivative over the cumulative change in the fair value of a hypothetical derivative which is created to match the exact terms of the underlying instruments being hedged.     (2)    The cash flow hedge ineffectiveness is reflected in the gain (loss) on loans and securities, net line item.  During the upcoming twelve months, the Company expects to include a pre-tax amount of approximately $13.6 million of net unrealized losses that are currently reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss in net operating interest income as a yield adjustment in the same periods in which the related items affect earnings. The losses accumulated in other comprehensive loss on the derivative instruments terminated shown in the preceding table will be included in net operating interest income over the periods the related items will affect earnings, ranging from 98 days to approximately 14 years.

Changes in the fair value of the derivatives are recognized currently in the gain (loss) on loans and securities, net line item.  Fair value hedges are accounted for by recording the fair value of the financial derivative instrument and the change in fair value of the asset or liability being hedged on the consolidated balance sheet. To the extent that the hedge is ineffective, the changes in the fair values will not offset and the difference, or hedge ineffectiveness, is reflected in the gain (loss) on loans and securities, net line item in the consolidated statement of loss. Cash payments or receipts and related accruals during the reporting period on derivatives included in fair value hedge relationships are recorded as an adjustment to interest income or expense on the hedged item.  Hedge accounting is discontinued for fair value hedges if a financial derivative instrument ceases to be a highly effective as a hedge or if the derivative is sold, terminated or de-designated. If fair value hedge accounting is discontinued, the net gain or loss on the underlying transactions being hedged is amortized to interest expense or interest income over the original forecasted period at the time of de-designation. Changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments after de-designation of fair value hedge accounting are recorded in the gain (loss) on loans and securities, net line item in the consolidated statement of loss. For a discontinued fair value hedge, the previously hedged item is no longer adjusted for changes in fair value.

The fair value hedge ineffectiveness is reflected in the gain (loss) on loans and securities, net line item.  Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments  The Company also enters into derivative transactions not designated as hedging instruments. These derivative instruments primarily consist of interest rate contracts as of March 31, 2009.  Interest Rate Contracts  The Company also enters into interest rate contracts based on market movements. These derivatives are recorded at fair value on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet with the change in fair value and interest income or expense recognized in gain (loss) on loans and securities, net. The change in fair value of these derivative instruments resulted in a $0.2 million loss for the three months ended March 31, 2009.  Liability to Lehman Brothers  Prior to Lehman Brothers’ declaration of bankruptcy in September 2008, the Bank was a counterparty to interest rate derivative contracts with a subsidiary of Lehman Brothers. Lehman Brothers’ declaration of bankruptcy triggered an event of default and early termination under the Bank’s International Swap Dealers Association Master Agreement. As of the date of the event of default, the Bank’s net amount due to the Lehman Brothers subsidiary was approximately $101 million, the majority of which was collateralized by securities held by or on behalf of the Lehman Brothers subsidiary. The Bank is currently pursuing a settlement of the obligation, including a return of the collateral and payment of cash for the net amount owed to Lehman Brothers.  Credit Risk  Impact on Fair Value Measurements  Credit risk is an element of the recurring fair value measurements for certain assets and liabilities, including derivative instruments. Credit risk is managed by limiting activity to approved counterparties and setting aggregate exposure limits for each approved counterparty. The Company also monitors collateral requirements on derivative instruments through credit support agreements, which reduce risk by permitting the netting of transactions with the same counterparty upon occurrence of certain events.  The Company considered the impact of credit risk on the fair value measurement for derivative instruments, particularly those in net liability positions to counterparties, to be mitigated by the enforcement of credit support     69    Table of Contents  agreements, and the collateral requirements therein. The Company pledged approximately $284.9 million of its mortgage-backed securities as collateral related to its derivative contracts as of March 31, 2009.  The Company’s credit risk analysis for derivative instruments also considered whether the cost to mitigate the credit loss exposure on derivative instruments in net asset positions would have resulted in material adjustments to the valuations. During the three months ended March 31, 2009, the consideration of counterparty credit risk did not result in an adjustment to the valuation of its derivative financial instruments.  Impact on Liquidity  In the normal course of business, collateral requirements contained in the Company’s derivative instruments are enforced by the Company and its counterparties. Upon enforcement of the collateral requirements, the amount of collateral requested is typically based on the net fair value of all derivative instruments with the counterparty; that is derivative assets net of derivative liabilities at the counterparty level. If the Company were to be in violation of certain provisions of the derivative instruments, the counterparties to the derivative instruments could request payment or collateralization on derivative instruments. The Company expects such requests would be based on the fair value of derivative assets net of derivative liabilities at the counterparty level. Derivative instruments in net liability positions at the counterparty level was $248.4 million as of March 31, 2009. The fair value of the Company’s mortgage-backed securities pledged as collateral, $284.9 million as of March 31, 2009, exceeded derivative instruments in net liability positions at the counterparty level by $36.5 million.

Springing Lien Notes  In November 2007, the Company issued an aggregate principal amount of $1.8 billion in springing lien notes due November 2017 (“12 1/2% Notes”). Interest is payable semi-annually and the notes are non-callable for five years and may then be called by the Company at a premium, which declines over time. The Company has the option to make interest payments on its 12 1/2% Notes in the form of either cash or additional 12 1/2% Notes through May 2010.   The indenture for the Company’s 12 1 /2% Notes requires the Company to secure the 12 1/2% Notes with the property and assets of the Company and any future subsidiary guarantors (subject to certain exceptions). The requirement to secure the 12 1/2% Notes will occur on the earlier of: (1) the date on which the 8% Notes are redeemed or (2) the first date on which the Company is allowed to grant liens in excess of $300 million under the 8% Notes. The requirement to secure the 12 1/2% Notes is limited to the amount of debt under the 12 1/2% Notes that would not trigger a requirement for the Company to equally and ratably secure the existing 8% Notes, 7 3/8% Notes and the 7 7/8% Notes.  NOTE 10—LOSS PER SHARE  The following table is a reconciliation of basic and diluted loss per share (in thousands, except per share amounts):                    Three Months EndedMarch 31,        2009     2008     Basic:             Numerator:             Loss from continuing operations, net of tax   $ (232,685 )   $ (92,927 )   Income from discontinued operations, net of tax     —        1,734                       Net loss   $ (232,685 )   $ (91,193 )                     Denominator:             Basic weighted-average shares outstanding     567,833       460,857                       Diluted:             Numerator:             Net loss   $ (232,685 )   $ (91,193 )                     Denominator:             Diluted weighted-average shares outstanding     567,833       460,857                       Per share:             Basic loss per share:             Loss per share from continuing operations   $ (0.41 )   $ (0.20 )   Earnings per share from discontinued operations     —        0.00                       Net loss per share   $ (0.41 )   $ (0.20 )                     Diluted loss per share:             Loss per share from continuing operations   $ (0.41 )   $ (0.20 )   Earnings per share from discontinued operations     —        0.00                       Net loss per share   $ (0.41 )   $ (0.20 )                      72    Table of Contents For the three months ended March 31, 2009 and 2008, the Company excluded from the calculations of diluted loss per share 35.3 million shares and 85.0 million shares, respectively, of stock options and restricted stock awards and units that would have been anti-dilutive. Of the excluded shares, 3.0 million shares and 48.1 million shares for the three months ended March 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, were anti-dilutive because of the Company’s net loss for the periods. Included in the 48.1 million shares for the three months ended March 31, 2008, were 46.7 million shares that had not been issued in connection with the Citadel Investment.  NOTE 11—REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS  Registered Broker-Dealers  The Company’s U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to the Uniform Net Capital Rule (the “Rule”) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 administered by the SEC and Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”), which requires the maintenance of minimum net capital. The minimum net capital requirements can be met under either the Aggregate Indebtedness method or the Alternative method. Under the Aggregate Indebtedness method, a broker-dealer is required to maintain minimum net capital of the greater of 6  2/3% of its aggregate indebtedness, as defined, or a minimum dollar amount. Under the Alternative method, a broker-dealer is required to maintain net capital equal to the greater of $250,000 or 2% of aggregate debit balances arising from customer transactions. The method used depends on the individual U.S. broker-dealer subsidiary. The Company’s international broker-dealer subsidiaries, located in Europe and Asia, are subject to capital requirements determined by their respective regulators.  As of March 31, 2009, all of the Company’s significant broker-dealer subsidiaries met minimum net capital requirements. Total required net capital was $0.1 billion at March 31, 2009. In addition, the Company’s broker-dealer subsidiaries had excess net capital of $0.5 billion at March 31, 2009. Banking  E*TRADE Bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can trigger certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on E*TRADE Bank’s financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, E*TRADE Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of E*TRADE Bank’s assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. E*TRADE Bank’s capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors.  Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require E*TRADE Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of Total and Tier I Capital to risk-weighted assets and Tier I Capital to adjusted total assets. As shown in the table below, at March 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, the OTS categorized E*TRADE Bank as “well capitalized” under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. However, events beyond management’s control, such as a continued deterioration in residential real estate and credit markets, could adversely affect future earnings and E*TRADE Bank’s ability to meet its future capital requirements.    73    Table of Contents E*TRADE Bank’s required actual capital amounts and ratios are presented in the table below (dollars in thousands):                              Actual     Minimum Requiredto Qualify asAdequatelyCapitalized     Minimum Required to beWell Capitalized UnderPrompt CorrectiveAction Provisions        Amount   Ratio     Amount   Ratio     Amount   Ratio     March 31, 2009:                           Total Capital to risk-weighted assets   $ 2,883,333   11.82 %   >$ 1,951,326   >8.0 %   >$ 2,439,158   >10.0 %   Tier I Capital to risk-weighted assets   $ 2,568,150   10.53 %   >$  975,663   >4.0 %   >$ 1,463,495   > 6.0 %   Tier I Capital to adjusted total assets   $ 2,568,150   5.63 %   >$ 1,824,067   >4.0 %   >$ 2,280,084   > 5.0 %   December 31, 2008:                           Total Capital to risk-weighted assets   $ 3,136,650   12.95 %   >$ 1,937,583   >8.0 %   >$ 2,421,979   >10.0 %   Tier I Capital to risk-weighted assets   $ 2,824,299   11.66 %   >$  968,792   >4.0 %   >$ 1,453,187   > 6.0 %   Tier I Capital to adjusted total assets   $ 2,824,299   6.29 %   >$ 1,796,601   >4.0 %   >$ 2,245,751   > 5.0 %  NOTE 12—COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENCIES AND OTHER REGULATORY MATTERS  Legal Matters  Litigation Matters  On October 27, 2000, a complaint was filed in the Superior Court for the State of California, County of Santa Clara, entitled, “Ajaxo, Inc., a Delaware corporation, Plaintiff, versus E*TRADE GROUP, INC., a Delaware corporation; and Everypath, Inc., a California corporation; and Does 1 through 50, inclusively, Defendants.” Through this complaint, Ajaxo sought damages and certain non-monetary relief for the Company’s alleged breach of a non-disclosure agreement with Ajaxo pertaining to certain wireless technology offered to the Company by Ajaxo as well as damages and other relief against both the Company and defendant Everypath, Inc., for their alleged misappropriation of Ajaxo’s trade secrets. Following a jury trial, a judgment was entered in 2003 in favor of Ajaxo against the Company for $1.3 million dollars for breach of the Ajaxo non-disclosure agreement. Although the jury also found in favor of Ajaxo on its misappropriation of trade secrets claim against the Company and defendant Everypath, the trial court subsequently denied Ajaxo’s requests for additional damages and relief on these claims. Thereafter, all parties appealed, and on December 21, 2005, the California Court of Appeal affirmed the above-described award against the Company for breach of the nondisclosure agreement but remanded the case to the trial court for the limited purpose of determining what, if any, additional damages Ajaxo may be entitled to as a result of the jury’s previous finding in favor of Ajaxo on its misappropriation of trade secrets claim against the Company and defendant Everypath. Following the foregoing ruling by the Court of Appeal, defendant Everypath ceased operations and made an assignment for the benefit of its creditors in January, 2006. As a result, defendant Everypath is no longer defending the case. Although the Company paid Ajaxo the full amount due on the judgment against it above, the case, consistent with the rulings issued by the Court of Appeal, was remanded back to the trial court, and on May 30, 2008, a jury returned a verdict in favor of E*TRADE denying all claims raised and demands for damages against the Company by Ajaxo. Following the trial court’s filing on September 5, 2008, of entry of judgment in favor of E*TRADE, Ajaxo filed post trial motions asking the trial court to grant a new trial and to vacate its September 5, 2008, entry of judgment in favor of the Company. By order dated November 4, 2008, the court denied these motions. On December 2, 2008, Ajaxo filed its notice of appeal, and the due date for Ajaxo to file its opening appellate brief is now June 8, 2009. The Company will continue to vigorously defend itself and oppose Ajaxo’s appeal.  On October 2, 2007, a class action complaint alleging violations of the federal securities laws was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against the Company and its then Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer entitled, “Larry Freudenberg, Individually and on Behalf of All     74    Table of Contents  Others Similarly Situated, Plaintiff, versus E*TRADE Financial Corporation, Mitchell H. Caplan and Robert J. Simmons, Defendants.” By order dated July 17, 2008, the trial court consolidated the Freudenberg action with four other purported class actions, all of which were filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York and which were based on the same facts and circumstances as the Freudenberg action. By the same July 17, 2008 order, the trial court appointed the “Kristen-Straxton Group” and Ira Newman co-lead plaintiffs and Brower Piven and Levi & Korsinski, respectively, as lead and co-lead plaintiffs’ counsel. Thereafter, on January 16, 2009, plaintiffs served their “Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint for Violations of the Federal Securities Laws.” In their amended complaint, plaintiffs again name the Company’s former chief executive and financial officers as defendants as well as Dennis Webb, the Company’s former Capital Markets Division President. In their amended complaint, Plaintiffs allege causes of action for violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) and Rule 10b-5 against all defendants and violations of Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act against the individual defendants. In specific, plaintiffs contend, among other things, that the value of E*TRADE’s stock between April 19, 2006 and November 9, 2007 (the “class period”) was artificially inflated because defendants, among other things, issued materially false and misleading statements and failed to disclose that the Company was experiencing a rise in delinquency rates in its mortgage and home equity portfolios; failed to timely record an impairment on its mortgage and home equity portfolios; materially overvalued its securities portfolio, which included assets backed by mortgages; and based on the foregoing, lacked a reasonable basis for the positive statements it made about the Company’s earnings and prospects. Plaintiffs seek to recover damages in an amount to be proven at trial, including interest and attorneys’ fees and costs. By prior order of the court, defendants filed their motion to dismiss on April 2, 2009, and all parties are to complete briefing on defendants’ motion to dismiss by August 17, 2009. The Company intends to vigorously defend itself against these claims.  On August 15, 2008, an action entitled, “Ronald M. Tate, Trustee of the Ronald M. Tate Trust Dtd 4/13/88, and George Avakian, an Individual, Plaintiffs, versus E*TRADE Financial Corporation, Mitchell H. Caplan, an Individual, and Robert J. Simmons, an Individual, Defendants” was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The Tate action is based on the same facts and circumstances, and contains the same claims, as the Freudenberg consolidated actions discussed above. By agreement of the parties and approval of the court, the Tate action has been consolidated with the Freudenberg consolidated actions for the purpose of pre-trial discovery. The Company intends to vigorously defend itself against these claims.  Based upon the same facts and circumstances alleged in the Freudenberg consolidated actions above, a verified shareholder derivative complaint was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on October 4, 2007, against the Company’s then Chief Executive Officer, President/Chief Operating Officer, Chief Financial Officer and individual members of its board of directors entitled, “Catherine Rubery, Derivatively on behalf of E*TRADE Financial Corporation, Plaintiff, versus Mitchell H. Caplan, R. Jarrett Lilien, Robert J. Simmons, George A. Hayter, Daryl Brewster, Ronald D. Fisher, Michael K. Parks, C. Catherine Raffaeli, Lewis E. Randall, Donna L. Weaver, and Stephen H. Willard, Defendants, -and- E*TRADE Financial Corporation, a Delaware corporation, Nominal Defendant.” Plaintiff alleges, among other things, causes of action for breach of fiduciary duty, waste of corporate assets, unjust enrichment, and violation of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder. The above federal shareholder derivative complaint has been consolidated with another shareholder derivative complaint brought in the same court and against the same named defendants entitled, “Marilyn Clark, Derivatively On Behalf of E*TRADE Financial Corporation, Plaintiff, versus Mitchell H. Caplan, et al., Defendants” (collectively, with the Rubery case, the “federal derivative actions”). Three similar derivative actions, based on the same facts and circumstances as the federal derivative actions, but alleging exclusively state causes of action, have been filed in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County. These three state cases have been ordered consolidated in that court under the caption “In re: E*Trade Financial Corporation Derivative Litigation, Lead Index No. 07-603736” (the “state derivative actions”). In these state derivative actions, plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint on March 23, 2009. By agreement of the parties and approval of the respective courts, further proceedings in both these federal and state derivative actions will continue to trail those in the federal securities class actions discussed above.    75    Table of Contents On April 2, 2008, a class action complaint alleging violations of the federal securities laws was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against the Company entitled, “John W. Oughtred, Individually, and on Behalf of all Others Similarly Situated, Plaintiff, v. E*TRADE Financial Corporation and E*TRADE Securities, LLC, Defendants.” Plaintiff contends, among other things, that the E*TRADE defendants committed various sales practice violations in the sale of certain auction rate securities to investors between April 2, 2003, and February 13, 2008 (the “class period”) by allegedly misrepresenting that these securities were highly liquid and safe investments for short term investing. On April 17, 2008, the trial court entered an order relieving the defendants of their obligation to move, answer or otherwise respond to the complaint until such time as the court may deem appropriate. Thereafter, plaintiff Oughtred joined plaintiffs in twelve other actions involving auction rate securities (in which the Company is not named as defendant) in filing a motion seeking to centralize all 13 actions in the Southern District of New York or in the alternative, the Northern District of California. By order filed October 9, 2008, a United States Judicial Panel on Multi-District Litigation denied plaintiffs’ motion to transfer. On December 18, 2008, plaintiffs filed their first amended class action complaint, and defendants filed their pending motion to dismiss plaintiffs’ amended complaint on February 5, 2009. Subsequently, plaintiff John Oughtred voluntarily dismissed his class action claims against defendants on March 12, 2009; as a result, Mr. Oughtred no longer is a party to this class action. The Company intends to vigorously defend itself against the claims raised in this action.  On October 11, 2006, a state class action entitled, “Nikki Greenberg, and all those similarly situated, plaintiffs, versus E*TRADE FINANCIAL Corporation, defendant” was filed in the Superior Court for the State of California, County of Los Angeles on behalf of all customers or consumers who allegedly made or received telephone calls from E*TRADE that were recorded without their knowledge or consent following a telephone call from plaintiff Greenberg to the Company’s Beverly Hills financial center on August 8, 2006, that was recorded during a brief period when the Company’s automated notice system was out of order. On February 7, 2008, class certification was granted and the class defined to consist of (1) all persons in California who received telephone calls from E*TRADE and whose calls were recorded without their consent within three years of October 11, 2006, and (2) all persons who made calls from California to the Beverly Hills financial center of the Company on August 8, 2006. In the interim, the Company has filed motions seeking to de-certify or further limit the defined class, and plaintiffs have filed competing motions seeking to expand it. On February 6, 2009, the parties to this dispute reached an agreement in principle to settle this matter, and the trial court will hold a hearing on May 11, 2009, on plaintiffs’ motion seeking preliminary approval of the parties’ proposed settlement. As a result, the hearing of the parties’ pending motions, formerly scheduled for March 6, 2009, has been taken off the calendar.  In addition to the matters described above, the Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the normal course of business which could have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In each pending matter, the Company contests liability or the amount of claimed damages. In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of such matters, particularly in cases where claimants seek substantial or indeterminate damages, or where investigation or discovery have yet to be completed, the Company cannot predict with certainty the loss or range of loss related to such matters, how such matters will be resolved, when they will ultimately be resolved, or what any eventual settlement, fine, penalty or other relief might be. Subject to the foregoing, the Company believes that the outcome of any such pending matter will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition of the Company, although the outcome could be material to the Company’s or a business segment’s operating results in the future, depending, among other things, upon the Company’s or business segment’s income for such period.  An unfavorable outcome in any matter that is not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, even if the ultimate outcomes are resolved in the Company’s favor, the defense of such litigation could entail considerable cost or the diversion of the efforts of management, either of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.    76    Table of Contents Regulatory Matters  The securities and banking industries are subject to extensive regulation under federal, state and applicable international laws. From time to time, the Company has been threatened with or named as a defendant in, lawsuits, arbitrations and administrative claims involving securities, banking and other matters. The Company is also subject to periodic regulatory audits and inspections. Compliance and trading problems that are reported to regulators, such as the SEC, FINRA, OTS or FDIC by dissatisfied customers or others are investigated by such regulators, and may, if pursued, result in formal claims being filed against the Company by customers or disciplinary action being taken against the Company or its employees by regulators. Any such claims or disciplinary actions that are decided against the Company could have a material impact on the financial results of the Company or any of its subsidiaries.  In March 2009, the Company’s subsidiary ETCM and 13 other current or former specialist firms on various regional exchanges finalized a settlement of SEC charges alleging that such firms executed proprietary orders in a given security prior to a customer order in the same security (a practice commonly known as “trading ahead”) during the period 1999-2005. ETCM was a specialist on the Chicago Stock Exchange during the period under review although it exited the specialist business in 2007. According to the SEC complaint, the majority of the alleged violations occurred between 1999 and 2002. As part of the settlement, ETCM consented to the entry of an injunction from future violations of Chicago Stock Exchange Article 9 Rule 17 and the payment of $28.3 million in disgorgement and a $5.7 million penalty, both of which had been reserved for in prior periods. ETCM also consented to findings that it violated section 17(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17a-3(a)(1) thereunder by failing to make or keep current an itemized record of all purchases and sales in its proprietary account. ETCM settled the SEC charges without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint.  On October 17, 2007, the SEC initiated an informal inquiry into matters related to the Company’s mortgage loan and mortgage-related securities investment portfolios. That inquiry is continuing. The Company is cooperating fully with the SEC in this matter.  Beginning in approximately August 2008, representatives of various states attorneys general and FINRA initiated informal inquiries regarding the purchase of auction rate securities by the Company’s customers. The Company is cooperating with these inquiries.  Insurance  The Company maintains insurance coverage that management believes is reasonable and prudent. The principal insurance coverage it maintains covers commercial general liability; property damage; hardware/software damage; cyber liability; directors and officers; employment practices liability; certain criminal acts against the Company; and errors and omissions. The Company believes that such insurance coverage is adequate for the purpose of its business. The Company’s ability to maintain this level of insurance coverage in the future, however, is subject to the availability of affordable insurance in the marketplace.  Reserves  For all legal matters, reserves are established in accordance with SFAS No. 5. Once established, reserves are adjusted based on available information when an event occurs requiring an adjustment.  Commitments  In the normal course of business, the Company makes various commitments to extend credit and incur contingent liabilities that are not reflected in the consolidated balance sheet. Significant changes in the economy or interest rates influence the impact that these commitments and contingencies have on the Company in the future.    77    Table of Contents Loans  In 2008, the Company exited its direct retail lending business, which was the last remaining loan origination channel of the Company. In March 2009, the Company partnered with a third party company to provide access to real estate loans for our customers. This product is being offered as a convenience to the Company’s customers and is not one of its primary product offerings. The Company structured this arrangement to minimize the typical risks commonly associated with mortgage lending. The third party company providing this product performs all processing and underwriting of these loans. Shortly after closing, the third party company purchases the loans from the Company and is responsible for the credit risk associated with these loans. As a result, the Company had $16.3 million in commitments to originate loans at March 31, 2009. The Company had no commitments to sell or purchase loans at March 31, 2009.  Securities, Unused Lines of Credit and Certificates of Deposit  At March 31, 2009, the Company had commitments to purchase $1.0 billion and sell $0.9 billion in securities. In addition, the Company had approximately $1.8 billion of certificates of deposit scheduled to mature in less than one year and $2.5 billion of unfunded commitments to extend credit.  Guarantees  In prior periods when the Company sold loans, the Company provided guarantees to investors purchasing mortgage loans, which are considered standard representations and warranties within the mortgage industry. The primary guarantees are that: the mortgage and the mortgage note have been duly executed and each is the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable in accordance with its terms; the mortgage has been duly acknowledged and recorded and is valid; and the mortgage and the mortgage note are not subject to any right of rescission, set-off, counterclaim or defense, including, without limitation, the defense of usury, and no such right of rescission, set-off, counterclaim or defense has been asserted with respect thereto. While the Company no longer sells loans, it is still responsible for the guarantees on loans sold in prior years. If these claims prove to be untrue, the investor can require the Company to repurchase the loan and return all loan purchase and servicing release premiums.  Management has determined that quantifying the potential liability exposure is not meaningful due to the nature of the standard representations and warranties, which rarely result in loan repurchases.  ETBH raised capital through the formation of trusts, which sold trust preferred stock in the capital markets. The capital securities are mandatorily redeemable in whole at the due date, which is generally 30 years after issuance. Each trust issues Floating Rate Cumulative Preferred Securities at par, with a liquidation amount of $1,000 per capital security. The proceeds from the sale of issuances are invested in ETBH’s Floating Rate Junior Subordinated Debentures.  During the 30-year period prior to the redemption of the Floating Rate Cumulative Preferred Securities, ETBH guarantees the accrued and unpaid distributions on these securities, as well as the redemption price of the securities and certain costs that may be incurred in liquidating, terminating or dissolving the trusts (all of which would otherwise be payable by the trusts). At March 31, 2009, management estimated that the maximum potential liability under this arrangement is equal to approximately $437.6 million or the total face value of these securities plus dividends, which may be unpaid at the termination of the trust arrangement.  NOTE 13—SEGMENT INFORMATION  Beginning in the first quarter of 2009, the Company revised its segment financial reporting to reflect the manner in which its chief operating decision maker had begun assessing the Company’s performance and making resource allocation decisions. As a result, the Company now reports its operating results in two segments: 1) “Trading and Investing”, which includes the businesses that were formerly in the “Retail” segment and now     78    Table of Contents  includes the Company’s market making business, and 2) “Balance Sheet Management”, which includes the businesses from the former “Institutional” segment, other than the market-making business. The Company’s segment financial information from prior periods has been reclassified in accordance with the new segment financial reporting.  Trading and investing includes:        •    brokerage and related asset gathering products and services;        •    investor-focused banking products and services;        •    market-making; and        •    stock plan administration products and services.  Balance sheet management includes:        •    managing loans previously originated or purchased from third parties; and        •    leveraging these loans and customer cash and deposit relationships.  The Company evaluates the performance of its segments based on segment contribution (net revenue less provision for loan losses and operating expense). All corporate overhead, administrative and technology charges are allocated to segments either in proportion to their respective direct costs or based upon specific operating criteria.    79    Table of Contents Financial information for the Company’s reportable segments is presented in the following tables (dollars in thousands):                            Three Months Ended March 31, 2009

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES        (a)   Our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, after evaluating the effectiveness of the Company’s “disclosure controls and procedures” (as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report, have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective based on their evaluation of these controls and procedures required by paragraph (b) of Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15.    81    Table of Contents     (b)   Our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer have evaluated the changes to the Company’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our last fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2009, as required by paragraph (d) of Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15, and have concluded that there were no such changes that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.  PART II—OTHER INFORMATION      ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS  On October 27, 2000, a complaint was filed in the Superior Court for the State of California, County of Santa Clara, entitled, “Ajaxo, Inc., a Delaware corporation, Plaintiff, versus E*TRADE GROUP, INC., a Delaware corporation; and Everypath, Inc., a California corporation; and Does 1 through 50, inclusively, Defendants.” Through this complaint, Ajaxo sought damages and certain non-monetary relief for the Company’s alleged breach of a non-disclosure agreement with Ajaxo pertaining to certain wireless technology offered to the Company by Ajaxo as well as damages and other relief against both the Company and defendant Everypath, Inc., for their alleged misappropriation of Ajaxo’s trade secrets. Following a jury trial, a judgment was entered in 2003 in favor of Ajaxo against the Company for $1.3 million dollars for breach of the Ajaxo non-disclosure agreement. Although the jury also found in favor of Ajaxo on its misappropriation of trade secrets claim against the Company and defendant Everypath, the trial court subsequently denied Ajaxo’s requests for additional damages and relief on these claims. Thereafter, all parties appealed, and on December 21, 2005, the California Court of Appeal affirmed the above-described award against the Company for breach of the nondisclosure agreement but remanded the case to the trial court for the limited purpose of determining what, if any, additional damages Ajaxo may be entitled to as a result of the jury’s previous finding in favor of Ajaxo on its misappropriation of trade secrets claim against the Company and defendant Everypath. Following the foregoing ruling by the Court of Appeal, defendant Everypath ceased operations and made an assignment for the benefit of its creditors in January, 2006. As a result, defendant Everypath is no longer defending the case. Although the Company paid Ajaxo the full amount due on the judgment against it above, the case, consistent with the rulings issued by the Court of Appeal, was remanded back to the trial court, and on May 30, 2008, a jury returned a verdict in favor of E*TRADE denying all claims raised and demands for damages against the Company by Ajaxo. Following the trial court’s filing on September 5, 2008, of entry of judgment in favor of E*TRADE, Ajaxo filed post trial motions asking the trial court to grant a new trial and to vacate its September 5, 2008, entry of judgment in favor of the Company. By order dated November 4, 2008, the court denied these motions. On December 2, 2008, Ajaxo filed its notice of appeal, and the due date for Ajaxo to file its opening appellate brief is now June 8, 2009. The Company will continue to vigorously defend itself and oppose Ajaxo’s appeal.  On October 2, 2007, a class action complaint alleging violations of the federal securities laws was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against the Company and its then Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer entitled, “Larry Freudenberg, Individually and on Behalf of All Others Similarly Situated, Plaintiff, versus E*TRADE Financial Corporation, Mitchell H. Caplan and Robert J. Simmons, Defendants.” By order dated July 17, 2008, the trial court consolidated the Freudenberg action with four other purported class actions, all of which were filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York and which were based on the same facts and circumstances as the Freudenberg action. By the same July 17, 2008 order, the trial court appointed the “Kristen-Straxton Group” and Ira Newman co-lead plaintiffs and Brower Piven and Levi & Korsinski, respectively, as lead and co-lead plaintiffs’ counsel. Thereafter, on January 16, 2009, plaintiffs served their “Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint for Violations of the Federal Securities Laws.” In their amended complaint, plaintiffs again name the Company’s former chief executive and financial officers as defendants as well as Dennis Webb, the Company’s former Capital Markets Division President. In their amended complaint, Plaintiffs allege causes of action for violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) and Rule 10b-5 against all defendants and violations of Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act against the individual defendants. In specific, plaintiffs contend, among other things, that the value of E*TRADE’s stock between April 19, 2006 and     82    Table of Contents  November 9, 2007 (the “class period”) was artificially inflated because defendants, among other things, issued materially false and misleading statements and failed to disclose that the Company was experiencing a rise in delinquency rates in its mortgage and home equity portfolios; failed to timely record an impairment on its mortgage and home equity portfolios; materially overvalued its securities portfolio, which included assets backed by mortgages; and based on the foregoing, lacked a reasonable basis for the positive statements it made about the Company’s earnings and prospects. Plaintiffs seek to recover damages in an amount to be proven at trial, including interest and attorneys’ fees and costs. By prior order of the court, defendants filed their motion to dismiss on April 2, 2009, and all parties are to complete briefing on defendants’ motion to dismiss by August 17, 2009. The Company intends to vigorously defend itself against these claims.  On August 15, 2008, an action entitled, “Ronald M. Tate, Trustee of the Ronald M. Tate Trust Dtd 4/13/88, and George Avakian, an Individual, Plaintiffs, versus E*TRADE Financial Corporation, Mitchell H. Caplan, an Individual, and Robert J. Simmons, an Individual, Defendants” was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The Tate action is based on the same facts and circumstances, and contains the same claims, as the Freudenberg consolidated actions discussed above. By agreement of the parties and approval of the court, the Tate action has been consolidated with the Freudenberg consolidated actions for the purpose of pre-trial discovery. The Company intends to vigorously defend itself against these claims.  Based upon the same facts and circumstances alleged in the Freudenberg consolidated actions above, a verified shareholder derivative complaint was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on October 4, 2007, against the Company’s then Chief Executive Officer, President/Chief Operating Officer, Chief Financial Officer and individual members of its board of directors entitled, “Catherine Rubery, Derivatively on behalf of E*TRADE Financial Corporation, Plaintiff, versus Mitchell H. Caplan, R. Jarrett Lilien, Robert J. Simmons, George A. Hayter, Daryl Brewster, Ronald D. Fisher, Michael K. Parks, C. Catherine Raffaeli, Lewis E. Randall, Donna L. Weaver, and Stephen H. Willard, Defendants, -and- E*TRADE Financial Corporation, a Delaware corporation, Nominal Defendant.” Plaintiff alleges, among other things, causes of action for breach of fiduciary duty, waste of corporate assets, unjust enrichment, and violation of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder. The above federal shareholder derivative complaint has been consolidated with another shareholder derivative complaint brought in the same court and against the same named defendants entitled, “Marilyn Clark, Derivatively On Behalf of E*TRADE Financial Corporation, Plaintiff, versus Mitchell H. Caplan, et al., Defendants” (collectively, with the Rubery case, the “federal derivative actions”). Three similar derivative actions, based on the same facts and circumstances as the federal derivative actions, but alleging exclusively state causes of action, have been filed in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County. These three state cases have been ordered consolidated in that court under the caption “In re: E*Trade Financial Corporation Derivative Litigation, Lead Index No. 07-603736” (the “state derivative actions”). In these state derivative actions, plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint on March 23, 2009. By agreement of the parties and approval of the respective courts, further proceedings in both these federal and state derivative actions will continue to trail those in the federal securities class actions discussed above.  On April 2, 2008, a class action complaint alleging violations of the federal securities laws was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against the Company entitled, “John W. Oughtred, Individually, and on Behalf of all Others Similarly Situated, Plaintiff, v. E*TRADE Financial Corporation and E*TRADE Securities, LLC, Defendants.” Plaintiff contends, among other things, that the E*TRADE defendants committed various sales practice violations in the sale of certain auction rate securities to investors between April 2, 2003, and February 13, 2008 (the “class period”) by allegedly misrepresenting that these securities were highly liquid and safe investments for short term investing. On April 17, 2008, the trial court entered an order relieving the defendants of their obligation to move, answer or otherwise respond to the complaint until such time as the court may deem appropriate. Thereafter, plaintiff Oughtred joined plaintiffs in twelve other actions involving auction rate securities (in which the Company is not named as defendant) in filing a motion seeking to centralize all 13 actions in the Southern District of New York or in the alternative, the Northern District of California. By order filed October 9, 2008, a United States Judicial Panel on Multi-District     83    Table of Contents  Litigation denied plaintiffs’ motion to transfer. On December 18, 2008, plaintiffs filed their first amended class action complaint, and defendants filed their pending motion to dismiss plaintiffs’ amended complaint on February 5, 2009. Subsequently, plaintiff John Oughtred voluntarily dismissed his class action claims against defendants on March 12, 2009; as a result, Mr. Oughtred no longer is a party to this class action. The Company intends to vigorously defend itself against the claims raised in this action.  On October 11, 2006, a state class action entitled, “Nikki Greenberg, and all those similarly situated, plaintiffs, versus E*TRADE FINANCIAL Corporation, defendant” was filed in the Superior Court for the State of California, County of Los Angeles on behalf of all customers or consumers who allegedly made or received telephone calls from E*TRADE that were recorded without their knowledge or consent following a telephone call from plaintiff Greenberg to the Company’s Beverly Hills financial center on August 8, 2006, that was recorded during a brief period when the Company’s automated notice system was out of order. On February 7, 2008, class certification was granted and the class defined to consist of (1) all persons in California who received telephone calls from E*TRADE and whose calls were recorded without their consent within three years of October 11, 2006, and (2) all persons who made calls from California to the Beverly Hills financial center of the Company on August 8, 2006. In the interim, the Company has filed motions seeking to de-certify or further limit the defined class, and plaintiffs have filed competing motions seeking to expand it. On February 6, 2009, the parties to this dispute reached an agreement in principle to settle this matter, and the trial court will hold a hearing on May 11, 2009, on plaintiffs’ motion seeking preliminary approval of the parties’ proposed settlement. As a result, the hearing of the parties’ pending motions, formerly scheduled for March 6, 2009, has been taken off the calendar.  In addition to the matters described above, the Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the normal course of business which could have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In each pending matter, the Company contests liability or the amount of claimed damages. In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of such matters, particularly in cases where claimants seek substantial or indeterminate damages, or where investigation or discovery have yet to be completed, the Company cannot predict with certainty the loss or range of loss related to such matters, how such matters will be resolved, when they will ultimately be resolved, or what any eventual settlement, fine, penalty or other relief might be. Subject to the foregoing, the Company believes that the outcome of any such pending matter will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition of the Company, although the outcome could be material to the Company’s or a business segment’s operating results in the future, depending, among other things, upon the Company’s or business segment’s income for such period.  In March 2009, the Company’s subsidiary ETCM and 13 other current or former specialist firms on various regional exchanges finalized a settlement of SEC charges alleging that such firms executed proprietary orders in a given security prior to a customer order in the same security (a practice commonly known as “trading ahead”) during the period 1999-2005. ETCM was a specialist on the Chicago Stock Exchange during the period under review although it exited the specialist business in 2007. According to the SEC complaint, the majority of the alleged violations occurred between 1999 and 2002. As part of the settlement, ETCM consented to the entry of an injunction from future violations of Chicago Stock Exchange Article 9 Rule 17 and the payment of $28.3 million in disgorgement and a $5.7 million penalty, both of which had been reserved for in prior periods. ETCM also consented to findings that it violated section 17(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17a-3(a)(1) thereunder by failing to make or keep current an itemized record of all purchases and sales in its proprietary account. ETCM settled the SEC charges without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint.  On October 17, 2007, the SEC initiated an informal inquiry into matters related to the Company’s mortgage loan and mortgage-related securities investment portfolios. That inquiry is continuing. The Company is cooperating fully with the SEC in this matter.    84    Table of Contents Beginning in approximately August 2008, representatives of various states attorneys general and FINRA initiated informal inquiries regarding the purchase of auction rate securities by the Company’s customers. The Company is cooperating with these inquiries.  An unfavorable outcome in any matter that is not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, even if the ultimate outcomes are resolved in the Company’s favor, the defense of such litigation could entail considerable cost or the diversion of the efforts of management, either of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.  The Company maintains insurance coverage that management believes is reasonable and prudent. The principal insurance coverage it maintains covers commercial general liability; property damage; hardware/software damage; cyber liability; directors and officers; employment practices liability; certain criminal acts against the Company; and errors and omissions. The Company believes that such insurance coverage is adequate for the purpose of its business. The Company’s ability to maintain this level of insurance coverage in the future, however, is subject to the availability of affordable insurance in the marketplace.      ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS  The risk factor presented below is a new risk factor for the Company and should be considered in addition to all of the risk factors previously disclosed in our 2008 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Our primary banking regulator has advised us to raise new capital for E*TRADE Bank and to reduce our own leverage, which will create significant dilution to our stockholders.  Our primary banking regulator, the Office of Thrift Supervision, has advised us in the near term to raise new capital for E*TRADE Bank and reduce the leverage of the parent holding company. Such efforts will involve the issuance of securities either in the public markets or to private investors, which will create significant dilution to current shareholders. One alternative that the Company continues to pursue is the U.S. Treasury’s TARP Capital Purchase Program which, if it is made available, would likely have conditions that would also produce significant dilution. The Company cannot predict when or if its application will be acted on.      ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS
