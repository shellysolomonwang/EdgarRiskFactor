ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS      The Dodd-Frank Act is expected to increase capital requirements for savings and loan holding companies. Compliance with these new capital requirements could adversely affect our Holding Companies and could alter our strategic plans.  The Dodd-Frank Act made extensive changes to the laws regulating banks, holding companies and financial services firms, and requires various federal agencies to adopt a broad range of new implementing rules and regulations and prepare numerous studies and reports for Congress. Among other changes, the Dodd-Frank Act imposes consolidated capital requirements on SLHCs. These requirements may have a significant long term effect on our Holding Companies. The Dodd-Frank Act requires the Federal Reserve to promulgate minimum    -35-    Table of Contents  capital requirements for SLHCs, including leverage (Tier 1) and risk-based capital requirements that are no less stringent than those applicable to banks at the time the Dodd-Frank Act was adopted.  On June 7, 2012, the Federal Reserve issued a notice of proposed rulemaking on increased capital requirements, implementing changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act and aspects of the Basel III regulatory capital reforms, portions of which would apply to top-tier SLHCs including H&R Block, Inc. Later in June 2012, the OCC and the FDIC joined the Federal Reserve in requesting comments on the notice of proposed rulemaking. The comment period on the proposed requirements was extended until October 22, 2012. These requirements, if enacted as proposed, will be transitioned in over the next several years, with new minimum capital requirements for SLHCs beginning as of January 1, 2013. We are still analyzing the proposed capital regulations and the effect they would have on us and our business.  The proposed capital requirements for SLHCs, if implemented as proposed, would require us to retain additional capital, restrict our ability to pay dividends and repurchase shares of our common stock and/or alter our strategic plans. See additional discussion in Part I, Item 2 under “Regulatory Environment.”  There have been no other material changes in our risk factors from those reported at April 30, 2012 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K.
