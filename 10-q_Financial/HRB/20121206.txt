ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS      Proposed Federal Reserve capital requirements may restrict our capital allocation strategies and we are therefore exploring alternatives to cease being a SLHC. If we were to cease being a SLHC, the means we use to deliver financial products and services to our customers and the profitability of those offerings could be adversely impacted.  Our subsidiary, HRB Bank, is a federal savings bank chartered under the Home Owner’s Loan Act of 1933, as amended. Our Holding Companies are SLHCs because they control HRB Bank.  The Dodd-Frank Act requires the Federal Reserve to promulgate minimum capital requirements for SLHCs, including leverage and risk-based capital requirements that are no less stringent than those applicable to insured depository institutions at the time the Dodd-Frank Act was enacted. On June 7, 2012, the Federal Reserve issued a notice of proposed rulemaking on regulatory capital requirements, implementing changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act and aspects of the Basel III regulatory capital reforms, portions of which would apply to our Holding Companies (“Proposed Capital Rules”). The OCC, which regulates HRB Bank, and the FDIC joined the Federal Reserve in requesting comments on the Proposed Capital Rules, and on August 8, 2012, the comment period was extended until October 22, 2012. We provided formal comments on the Proposed Capital Rules. It is currently unclear what the regulatory capital requirements for SLHCs will be and when such capital requirements will become effective. The Federal Reserve announced on November 9, 2012 that the implementation would be postponed beyond January 1, 2013 to an unspecified date.  In connection with its first examination of the Company, the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, the Company’s primary banking regulator, has requested that the Company include in its policies the guidance set forth in Supervisory Letter SR 09-4 (March 27, 2009) regarding the payment of dividends, stock redemptions and stock repurchases by bank holding companies. In Supervisory Letter SR 11-11 (July 21, 2011), the Federal Reserve described the supervisory approach it would use to examine SLHCs and directed examiners to apply the principles of SR 09-4 to SLHCs.  This guidance would require our Holding Companies to retain significant additional capital, even though HRB Bank has regulatory capital substantially above the “well capitalized” level. At this time, we do not foresee    -39-    Table of Contents  regulatory flexibility in this regard in light of the Federal Reserve’s views of the statutory requirements imposed under the Dodd-Frank Act. Accordingly, while our current belief is that dividends at current levels would continue to be permitted as long as HRB Bank remains well capitalized, the Federal Reserve will closely supervise and likely restrict other capital allocation decisions, including stock repurchases, acquisitions, and other forms of strategic investment. We believe that such regulatory constraints are inconsistent with our strategic plans, operational needs, and growth objectives.  We are in the process of evaluating alternative means of ceasing to be an SLHC, in which case we would no longer be subject to regulation by the Federal Reserve as an SLHC. In connection with that evaluation, we are exploring alternatives to continue delivering financial products and services to our customers.  Our evaluation of alternatives is in its early stages and therefore we cannot predict the timing, the circumstances, or the likelihood of us ceasing to be regulated as an SLHC, or whether cessation of SLHC status would have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.  There have been no other material changes in our risk factors from those reported at April 30, 2012 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K.        ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES
