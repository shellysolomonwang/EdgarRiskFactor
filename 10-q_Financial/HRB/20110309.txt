ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS       The elimination of the IRS debt indicator has caused federal and state regulators to scrutinize the RAL underwriting practices of third-party financial institutions that provide RALs.     In August 2010, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) announced that, as of the beginning of the upcoming tax season, it would no longer furnish the debt indicator (DI), to tax preparers or financial institutions. The DI is an underwriting tool that lenders use when considering whether to loan money to taxpayers who apply for a RAL, which is short term loan, secured by the taxpayer’s federal tax refund.   On December 23, 2010, HSBC terminated its contract with us to provide RALs in our retail tax offices based on restrictions placed on HSBC by its regulators due to the DI no longer being available. As a result, RALs were not offered in our retail tax offices this tax season. Subsequently, two other banks offering RALs this tax season through our competitors announced that due to regulatory concerns they will not be offering RALs next tax season. Additionally, a third bank offering RALs this tax season through our competitors announced that it was appealing a notice it had received from its regulator that its practice of originating RALs without the DI is “unsafe and unsound” and has recently filed a lawsuit in federal court against its regulator. Based on these developments and the overall limited amount of banks that offer RALs, there can be no assurances as to the availability of RALs in our retail tax offices in the future.   In addition, termination of the contract with HSBC could have adverse effects on our operating results this fiscal year, including declines in tax returns prepared as a result of clients seeking alternate preparers who continue to offers RALs this tax season, and declines in settlement product and related revenues to the extent prior RAL clients do not purchase a refund anticipation check or change their refund disbursement elections. A decline in clients could have other adverse impacts, including increased credit losses on loan balances with those clients.     Recent legislative and regulatory reforms may have a significant impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.     In July 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Reform Act) was signed into law, which contains a comprehensive set of provisions designed to govern the practices and oversight of financial institutions and other participants in the financial markets.   The full impact of the Reform Act is difficult to assess because many provisions require federal agencies to adopt implementing regulations. In addition, the Reform Act mandates multiple studies, which could result in additional legislative or regulatory action. The Reform Act, as well as other legislative and regulatory changes, could have a significant impact on us and on our subsidiary, HRB Bank, by, for example, requiring us to change our business practices, requiring us to meet more stringent capital, liquidity and leverage ratio requirements, limiting our ability to pursue business opportunities, imposing additional costs on us, limiting fees we can charge for services, impacting the value of our assets, or otherwise adversely affecting our businesses. Specific provisions of the Reform Act include:           •   changes to the thrift supervisory structure as the responsibility and authority of the Office of Thrift Supervision moves to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency in July 2011;     •   changes which may require the Company, as a thrift holding company, to meet regulatory capital, liquidity, leverage or other standards;     •   regulation of interchange fees charged by payment card issuers for transactions in which a person uses a debit or general-use prepaid card, and enforcement of a new statutory requirement that such fees be reasonable and proportional to the actual cost of the transaction to the issuer; and     •   establishment of a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau with broad authority to implement new consumer protection regulations.     The effect of the Reform Act on our business and operations could be significant, depending upon final implementation of regulations, the actions of our competitors and the behavior of other marketplace participants. In addition, we may be required to invest significant management time and resources to address the various provisions of the Reform Act and the numerous regulations that are required to be issued under it. The      39    Table of Contents    Reform Act and any related legislation or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.   There have been no other material changes in our risk factors from those reported at April 30, 2010 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K.      ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES
