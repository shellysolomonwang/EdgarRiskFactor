ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS     Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal year 2007 presents risk factors that may impact our future results. In light of recent developments in the mortgage, housing and secondary markets, the following risk factors should be read in conjunction with that discussion.   Potential Sale Transaction. In fiscal year 2007, we entered into an agreement to sell OOMC. On December 4, 2007, we agreed to terminate the agreement. We also announced that we would immediately terminate all remaining origination activities and pursue the sale of OOMC’s loan servicing activities. During January 2008, OOMC funded the last loan in its pipeline.   OOMC will continue to carry out its servicing activities and collect servicing revenues. Because of the cessation of new originations, the volume of mortgage loans serviced will gradually decline as the aggregate principal amount of existing loans being serviced declines without replacement. The majority of servicing activities are carried out with respect to loans owned by third parties.   We have estimated the fair values of the servicing business and other assets, which resulted in impairments recorded in discontinued operations of $116.3 million for the nine months ended January 31, 2008. Although we are actively pursuing the sale of our remaining loan servicing activities, it is possible that we will be unsuccessful in selling or selling at a price that does not result in further impairment.   Liquidity and Capital. We use capital primarily to fund working capital requirements, pay dividends and acquire businesses.   Market conditions and credit-rating downgrades have negatively impacted our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we had no commercial paper outstanding at January 31, 2008. As an alternative to commercial paper issuance, we have been borrowing under our unsecured revolving committed lines of credit    53    Table of Contents   (CLOCs) to support working capital requirements arising from off-season operating losses in our Tax Services and Business Services segments and operating losses from our mortgage businesses. We had borrowings totaling $1.8 billion outstanding under our CLOCs at January 31, 2008, of a total borrowing capacity of $2.0 billion.   The CLOCs, among other things, require we maintain at least $650.0 million of adjusted net worth, as defined in the agreement, on the last day of any fiscal quarter. On November 19, 2007, the CLOCs were amended to, among other things, require $450.0 million of adjusted net worth, for the fiscal quarters ending October 31, 2007 and January 31, 2008. We had adjusted net worth of $463.9 million at January 31, 2008, primarily due to operating losses of our discontinued operations.   A further disruption in credit markets, or a violation of covenants under our CLOCs, could adversely affect our access to these funds. To meet our future financing needs we may issue additional debt or equity securities.   As part of our loan servicing responsibilities, we are required to advance funds to cover delinquent scheduled principal and interest payments to security holders, as well as to cover delinquent tax and insurance payments and other costs required to protect the investors’ interest in the collateral securing the loans. Generally, servicing advances are recoverable from either the mortgagor, the insurer of the loan or the investor through the non-recourse provision of the loan servicing contract. In light of increased delinquencies of mortgage loans that we service, the amount of funds we are required to advance on a monthly basis has been increasing. Servicing advances and related assets totaled $1.2 billion and $445.4 million at January 31, 2008 and April 30, 2007, respectively. We expect the volume of servicing advances to increase, although we cannot know the volume of servicing advances that are likely to be required in any given period.   On October 1, 2007, OOMC entered into a facility to fund servicing advances (the “Servicing Advance Facility”), in which the servicing advances are collateral for the facility. The Servicing Advance Facility originally provided funding of up to $400.0 million to fund servicing advances through October 1, 2008. During the three months ended January 31, 2008, the facility was amended, increasing the available funding to $1.2 billion as of January 31, 2008. This facility is subject to various triggers, events or occurrences that could result in earlier termination, and bears interest at one-month LIBOR plus an additional margin rate. The Servicing Advance Facility terminates upon a “change in control” of OOMC, in which (i) a party or parties acting in concert acquire a 20% or more equity interest in OOMC or (ii) the Company does not own more than a 50% equity interest in OOMC. This on-balance sheet facility had a balance of $857.1 million at January 31, 2008, with the related liability reported in liabilities held-for-sale. We expect the volume of servicing advances to increase and, as a result, may need to increase the funding capacity of this facility or obtain other servicing advance financing.   Delinquencies and corresponding servicing advances increase significantly when adjustable rate mortgages (ARMs) initially reset. HRB Bank and OOMC are actively working with borrowers to minimize delinquencies, including modifying loans and notifying borrowers of upcoming rate changes prior to their reset date.   Market and Credit Risks. The valuation of our retained residual interests and mortgage servicing rights includes many estimates and assumptions made by management surrounding interest rates, prepayment speeds and credit losses. Variation in interest rates or the factors underlying our assumptions could affect our results of operations.   Conditions in the non-prime mortgage industry resulted in significant losses in our mortgage operations during fiscal years 2007 and 2008. The mortgage industry continues to be extremely volatile, which could result in further impairments to our residual interests and loans held for sale, or further losses as a result of obligations to repurchase loans previously sold. To the extent that market conditions remain volatile, or fail to improve, our mortgage business may continue to incur operating losses and asset impairments. See additional discussion of the performance of our mortgage operations in Part I, Item 2, under “Discontinued Operations.”   HRB Bank held mortgage loans for investment totaling $1.0 billion at January 31, 2008. The overall credit quality of mortgage loans held for investment is impacted by the strength of the U.S. economy and local economic conditions, including residential housing prices. Economic trends that negatively affect housing prices and the job market could result in deterioration in credit quality of our mortgage loan portfolio and a decline in the value of associated collateral. As discussed above, future ARM resets could also lead to increased delinquencies in our mortgage loans held for investment. Recent trends in the residential mortgage loan market reflect an increase in loan delinquencies and declining collateral values. As a result of similar trends in our loan portfolio, we recorded loan loss provisions totaling $12.3 million during the nine months ended    54    Table of Contents   January 31, 2008. If adverse trends in the residential mortgage loan market continue, including adverse trends in our mortgage loan portfolio specifically, we could incur additional significant loan loss provisions.   Regulatory Environment – Banking. H&R Block, Inc. is subject to a three percent minimum ratio of adjusted tangible capital to adjusted total assets, as defined by the OTS. We fell below the three percent minimum ratio at April 30, 2007. We notified the OTS of our failure to meet this requirement, and on May 29, 2007, the OTS issued a Supervisory Directive. We submitted a revised capital plan to the OTS on July 19, 2007, in which we expected to meet the three percent minimum ratio at April 30, 2008. The OTS accepted our revised capital plan.   The Supervisory Directive included additional conditions that we will be required to meet in addition to the Master Commitment. The significant additional conditions included in the Supervisory Directive are as follows: (1) requires HRB Bank to extend its compliance with a minimum 12.0% leverage ratio through fiscal year 2012; (2) requires H&R Block, Inc. to comply with the Master Commitment at all times, except for the projected capital levels and compliance with the three percent minimum ratio, as provided in the fiscal year 2008 and 2009 capital adequacy projections presented to the OTS on July 19, 2007; (3) institutes reporting requirements to the OTS quarterly and monthly by the Board of Directors and management, respectively; and (4) requires HRB Bank’s Board of Directors to have an independent chairperson and at least the same number of outside directors as inside directors.   Operating losses of our discontinued operations for the first nine months of fiscal year 2008 were higher than projected in our revised capital plan that was submitted to the OTS in July 2007. As a result, our capital levels are lower than those projections. H&R Block, Inc. continued to be below the three percent minimum ratio during our third quarter, and had adjusted tangible capital of negative $713.9 million, and a requirement of $311.9 million to be in compliance at January 31, 2008. We are currently seeking the elimination or modification of the three percent minimum capital requirement as a result of cessation of our mortgage business. At this time, we do not expect to be in compliance with the three percent minimum ratio at April 30, 2008. We currently believe that upon disposition of our mortgage business the OTS will reconsider the three percent minimum capital requirement, although there is no assurance that an elimination or modification will occur.   Failure to meet the conditions under the Master Commitment and the Supervisory Directive, including capital levels of H&R Block, Inc., could result in the OTS taking further regulatory actions, such as a supervisory agreement, cease-and-desist orders and civil monetary penalties. The OTS could also require us to sell assets, which could negatively impact our financial results. At this time, the financial impact, if any, of additional regulatory actions cannot be determined. See note 7 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information.   Regulatory Environment – Tax Services. On January 3, 2008, the IRS issued an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPR) concerning RALs. In this ANPR, the IRS states that it is considering proposing a rule that would prohibit the sharing of taxpayer information for the purpose of marketing RALs in connection with the preparation of a tax return. Until such time as final regulations are issued on this matter, we are unable to determine what impact, if any, this proposal would have on our operating results.     Other than the items discussed above, there have been no material changes in our risk factors from those reported at April 30, 2007 in our annual Report on Form 10-K.    55    Table of Contents         ITEM 2.
