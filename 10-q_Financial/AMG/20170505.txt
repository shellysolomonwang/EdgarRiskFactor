Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016.These factors (among others) could affect our financial performance and cause actual results to differ materially from historical earnings and those presently anticipated and projected. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we will not undertake and we specifically disclaim any obligation to release publicly the result of any revisions that may be made to any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements or to reflect the occurrence of events, whether or not anticipated. In that respect, we caution readers not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements.Management’s Discussion and Analysis should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.Executive OverviewWe are a global active asset management company with equity investments in leading boutique investment management firms, which we refer to as our “Affiliates.” Our innovative partnership approach allows each Affiliate’s management team to own significant equity in their firm and maintain operational autonomy. Our strategy is to generate shareholder value through the internal growth of existing Affiliates, as well as through investments in new Affiliates, and additional investments in existing Affiliates. In addition, we provide centralized assistance to our Affiliates in strategic matters, marketing, distribution, product development and operations. As of March 31, 2017, our aggregate assets under management were $753.5 billion, in over 550 investment products across a broad range of active return-oriented strategies.We hold meaningful equity interests in each of our Affiliates. In certain cases, we consolidate the Affiliate’s financial results in our Revenue, Operating expenses and Other non-operating (income) and expenses. In other cases, we use the equity method of accounting and our share of the Affiliate’s financial results is reported (net of intangible amortization) in Income from equity method investments. While we account for a majority of our Affiliates on a consolidated basis of accounting, a growing number of our Affiliates are accounted for on an equity method basis, including all of our 2016 investments in new Affiliates. As a result, equity method Affiliates represent a growing proportion of Net income (controlling interest), as evidenced by the increase in Income from equity method investments, as compared to our consolidated Affiliates, which represent a decreasing proportion of Net income (controlling interest).Whether we account for an Affiliate on a consolidated or equity method basis of accounting, we generally maintain the same partnership approach and provide support and assistance in substantially the same manner, and our operating model is generally the same. Furthermore, our Affiliates are impacted by similar marketplace factors and operational trends, which may not be observable when analyzing the financial results of consolidated and equity method Affiliates separately. Therefore, we believe our aggregate operating measures of assets under management, average assets under management and aggregate revenue, which incorporate the assets under management and revenues of all of our Affiliates regardless of the accounting treatment, have become increasingly important in providing management and investors with a more comprehensive view of the operating performance and material trends across our entire business. Aggregate revenue is calculated by combining the Revenue of our consolidated Affiliates with equity method revenue. We discuss both Revenue and equity method revenue in our Results of Operations. The following table presents our key operating performance measures:20  As of and for the Three Months Ended March 31,  (in billions, except as noted) 2016 2017 % ChangeAssets under management(1) $642.0 $753.5 17 %Average assets under management(1) 626.6 744.5 19 %       Consolidated Affiliate average assets under management $364.1 $386.9 6 %Equity method Affiliate average assets under management 262.5 357.6 36 %       Revenue (in millions) $545.4 $544.3 (0)%Equity method revenue (in millions)(2) 450.7 819.7 82 %__________________________(1) Assets under management is presented on a current basis without regard to the timing of the inclusion of an Affiliate’s financial results in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Average assets under management provides a more meaningful relationship to our financial and operating results as it reflects both the particular billing patterns of Affiliate sponsored products and client accounts and corresponds with the timing of the inclusion of an Affiliate's financial results in our Consolidated Financial Statements. (2) Equity method revenue consists of asset based and performance fees earned by our equity method Affiliates. Assets Under Management Through our Affiliates, we predominantly manage active return-oriented strategies rather than passive or indexing strategies, exchange-traded funds, fixed income or money market products, which typically carry lower fee rates. Notwithstanding the recent growth in passively managed products industrywide, we continue to see meaningful client demand for active return-oriented strategies, particularly in alternative and multi-asset strategies, reflecting continued investor demand for returns that are less correlated to traditional equity and fixed income markets. We expect client demand for alternative and multi-asset strategies to continue, and believe the best-performing active equity managers (whether global-, regional- or country-specific) will continue to have significant opportunities to grow from net client cash inflows. We believe we are well positioned to benefit further from these trends.The following charts and tables provide information regarding the composition of and changes in our assets under management on a current basis by active return-oriented strategy and client type:Assets under Management (in billions) at March 31, 2017By Strategy By Client Type__________________(1) Alternatives primarily include assets under management in long and short public equity, control equity, managed futures, multi-strategy, and other alternative and hedge fund strategies, as well as energy and infrastructure investments and primary and secondary private equity strategies. Alternative strategies generate earnings from (i) management fees from 21products subject to lock-ups or similar restrictions, (ii) management fees from products not subject to such restrictions and/or (iii) performance fees and carried interest.(2) Global equities include emerging markets strategies, which accounted for 9% of our overall assets under management as of March 31, 2017.(in billions)Alternatives Global Equities U.S. Equities Multi-asset & Other TotalDecember 31, 2016$252.4 $233.9 $110.1 $92.3 $688.7 Client cash inflows and commitments12.2 7.8 3.4 4.5 27.9 Client cash outflows and realizations(8.0) (8.9) (8.0) (4.3) (29.2) Net client cash flows4.2 (1.1) (4.6) 0.2 (1.3) New investments30.6 1.5 — 3.3 35.4 Market changes3.5 17.4 5.4 3.4 29.7 Foreign exchange(1)0.9 1.1 — 0.2 2.2 Other(1.0) (0.2) (0.0) — (1.2)March 31, 2017$290.6 $252.6 $110.9 $99.4 $753.5(in billions)Institutional Retail High Net Worth TotalDecember 31, 2016$401.2 $188.3 $99.2 $688.7Client cash inflows and commitments11.5 12.3 4.1 27.9Client cash outflows and realizations(15.5) (10.2) (3.5) (29.2)Net client cash flows(4.0) 2.1 0.6 (1.3)New investments31.0 1.2 3.2 35.4Market changes16.2 9.3 4.2 29.7Foreign exchange(1)1.4 0.7 0.1 2.2Other(1.0) (0.0) (0.2) (1.2)March 31, 2017$444.8 $201.6 $107.1 $753.5__________________________(1) Foreign exchange reflects the impact of translating non-U.S. dollar denominated assets under management into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes.In addition to assets under management, we also report average assets under management. Average assets under management provides a more meaningful relationship to our financial and operating results as it reflects both the particular billing patterns of Affiliate sponsored products and client accounts and corresponds with the timing of the inclusion of an Affiliate’s financial results in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Average assets under management increased by $117.9 billion or 19% for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the corresponding period in the prior year. The increase in average assets under management was primarily due to a 36% increase in average assets under management at equity method Affiliates, which primarily offer alternative strategies. In the last twelve months, equity method Affiliates assets under management have increased $55.5 billion as a result of our 2016 investments in new Affiliates, $21.1 billion from positive market changes and $16.9 billion from net client cash inflows. The increase in average assets under management was also due to a 6% increase in average assets under management at consolidated Affiliates where in the last twelve months we had positive market changes of $42.6 billion. This increase in assets under management from market changes was partially offset by net client cash outflows of $15.9 billion, primarily in U.S. equity strategies, and a reduction from foreign exchange of $6.5 billion.Aggregate RevenueAggregate revenue increased 37% in the three months ended March 31, 2017, due to an increase in equity method revenue of $369.0 million or 82%. The increase in equity method revenue was primarily due to a $334.9 million or 74% increase from our 2016 investments in new Affiliates and a $34.1 million or 8% increase in equity method revenue at existing Affiliates. The increase in aggregate revenue from equity method revenue was partially offset by a $1.1 million decline in Revenue at our 22consolidated Affiliates. The decline in Revenue at our consolidated Affiliates was primarily due to a $10.4 million or 1% decrease in performance fees partially offset by a $7.8 million or 1% increase in other fees and a $1.5 million increase in advisory fees. See Results of Operations for a further discussion of the changes in equity method revenue and Revenue at our consolidated Affiliates.Financial and Supplemental Financial Performance MeasuresThe following table presents our key financial and supplemental financial performance measures:  For the Three Months Ended March 31,  (in millions) 2016 2017 % ChangeNet income (controlling interest) $104.0 $122.5 18%Adjusted EBITDA (controlling interest)(1) 215.7 243.8 13%Economic net income (controlling interest)(1) 159.3 183.2 15%__________________________(1) Adjusted EBITDA (controlling interest) and Economic net income (controlling interest) are non-GAAP performance measures and are discussed in “Supplemental Financial Performance Measures.”We believe Adjusted EBITDA (controlling interest) is an important supplemental financial performance measure for our management and investors. Adjusted EBITDA (controlling interest) provides a comprehensive view of our share of the financial performance of our entire business before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, impairments and adjustments to our contingent payment obligations, regardless of the accounting treatment of our Affiliates. Conversely, our GAAP financial performance measure, operating income, includes the non-controlling interests’ share of financial performance and does not include our share of earnings from equity method Affiliates. Similarly, our other GAAP financial performance measure, Income before income taxes, includes the non-controlling interests’ share of financial performance.Our ownership level of consolidated Affiliates is higher than our ownership level of our equity method Affiliates and, as a result, we experience a greater proportion of an increase or decrease in Revenue from our consolidated Affiliates than an increase or decrease in our equity method revenue. While our equity method revenue increased 82% in the three months ended March 31, 2017, our revenue from consolidated Affiliates remained relatively flat, resulting in a $28.1 million or 13% increase in Adjusted EBITDA (controlling interests).While our Adjusted EBITDA (controlling interest) increased $28.1 million in the three months ended March 31, 2017, our Net income (controlling interest) increased by $18.5 million, primarily due to an increase in Equity method intangible amortization of $7.5 million from our 2016 investments in new Affiliates. We consider Economic net income (controlling interest) to be an important measure of our financial performance, as we believe it best represents our performance after tax and before our share of non-cash expenses relating to our acquisition of interests in our Affiliates. Our Economic net income (controlling interest) increased $23.9 million or 15% in the three months ended March 31, 2017, which is more on a percentage basis than the increase in Adjusted EBITDA (controlling interest), primarily due to changes in Other economic items and a reduction in interest expense. Results of OperationsThe following discussion includes the financial results of our consolidated and equity method Affiliates. Our consolidated Affiliates’ financial results are included in our Revenue, Operating expenses and Other non-operating (income) and expenses and our share of our equity method Affiliates’ financial results is reported (net of intangible amortization) in Income from equity method investments. RevenueThe following table summarizes our consolidated Affiliate average assets under management and Revenue.  For the Three Months Ended March 31,  (in millions, except as noted)2016 2017 % ChangeConsolidated Affiliates average assets under management (in billions)$364.1 $386.9 6 %Revenue$545.4 $544.3 (0 )%23Our Revenue decreased $1.1 million in the three months ended March 31, 2017, primarily due to a $10.4 million or 1% decrease in performance fees, partially offset by a $7.8 million or 1% increase in other fees and a $1.5 million increase in advisory fees. The change in advisory fee revenue was primarily due to an increase in average assets under management of 6% and a decline in our ratio of average fee rates of 3%. The decline in our ratio of average fees was primarily due to the restructuring of fee arrangements for certain mutual funds. The restructuring of the fee arrangements did not have a significant impact on Revenue as the reduction in asset based fees was partially offset by an increase in other fees. The decline in our ratio of average fees was also due to a decrease in asset based fees related to renewal commissions at one of our Affiliates in the United Kingdom as a result of a regulatory change. The decrease in asset based fees related to renewal commissions was offset by a reduction in distribution expenses at the Affiliate which are reported in Selling, general and administrative expenses.Operating ExpensesThe following table summarizes our consolidated operating expenses: For the Three Months Ended March 31,   % Change(in millions)2016 2017 Compensation and related expenses$226.7 $242.0 7 %Selling, general and administrative95.9 88.7 (8)%Intangible amortization and impairments26.6 21.9 (18)%Depreciation and other amortization5.0 5.2 4 %Other operating expenses (net)12.4 9.9 (20)%Total operating expenses$366.6 $367.7 0 %Our operating expenses are primarily attributable to the non-controlling interests because the substantial majority of these expenses are incurred by consolidated Affiliates through which we share in revenue without regard to expenses. For these Affiliates, the Affiliate’s Operating Allocation percentage generally determines the Affiliate’s operating expenses. Accordingly, our operating expenses are impacted by increases or decreases in each Affiliate’s revenue and corresponding increases or decreases in its respective Operating Allocation.Compensation and related expenses increased $15.3 million, or 7%, in the three months ended March 31, 2017, primarily as a result of increases in compensation expenses associated with Affiliate equity transactions of $10.4 million, or 5% and compensation expenses at Affiliates of $2.7 million and 1%. These changes primarily relate to the non-controlling interests.Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $7.2 million or 8% in the three months ended March 31, 2017, primarily from decreases in sub-advisory and distribution expenses, including renewal commissions, of $5.8 million or 6% at our Affiliates sponsoring retail products and acquisition-related professional fees of $1.0 million or 1%. Intangible amortization and impairments decreased $4.7 million or 18% in the three months ended March 31, 2017, as a result of a $3.2 million or 12% decrease related to a change in the pattern of economic benefit for certain assets and a $1.5 million or 6% decrease related to certain assets being fully amortized.There were no significant changes in Depreciation and other amortization in the three months ended March 31, 2017.Other operating expenses (net) decreased $2.5 million or 20% in the three months ended March 31, 2017, primarily from an increase in net gains on Affiliate sponsored consolidated investment products of $2.2 million or 18%. Income from Equity Method InvestmentsWhen we own a non-controlling interest in an Affiliate, we generally use the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method of accounting, we only recognize our share of the Affiliate’s revenue without regard to expenses or less certain agreed-upon expenses, net of equity method intangible amortization, in Income from equity method investments. When we share in the Affiliate’s revenue without regard to expenses, we are allocated a set percentage of revenue, with the remaining revenue available to the Affiliate to fund its operating expenses and distributions to Affiliate management. When we share in the Affiliate’s revenue less certain agreed-upon expenses, our distributions are calculated by reference to the Affiliate’s revenue less certain agreed-upon expenses. 24Additional investments in existing or new Affiliates will generally impact our financial results in the year of investment and, depending upon the timing, in the following year when the full-year financial results of the Affiliate investment are reflected in our financial statements.The following table summarizes equity method earnings and equity method intangible amortization, which together comprise Income from equity method investments, as well as equity method Affiliate average assets under management and equity method revenue: For the Three Months Ended March 31,  (in millions, except as noted)2016 2017 % ChangeEquity method earnings$82.2 $107.6 31%Equity method intangible amortization(14.2) (21.7) 53%Income from equity method investments$68.0 $85.9 26%      Operating Measures     Equity method Affiliates average assets under management (in billions)$262.5 $357.6 36%Equity method revenue$450.7 $819.7 82%Our equity method revenue increased $369.0 million or 82% in the three months ended March 31, 2017, primarily due to a $334.9 million or 74% increase from our 2016 investments in new Affiliates and an increase in asset based fees at existing Affiliates of $50.1 million or 11%. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in performance fees at existing Affiliates of $16.0 million or 3%. The change in asset based fees at existing equity method Affiliates was primarily due to an increase in average assets under management of 15% and a decline in our ratio of average fees of 2%. The decline in our ratio of average fee rates was due to changes in the composition of our assets under management between products that realize comparatively higher fee rates and products that realize comparatively lower fee rates.While equity method revenue increased 82% in the three months ended March 31, 2017, equity method earnings increased $25.4 million or 31%, primarily due to our 2016 investments in new Affiliates, in which we own less of the equity interests than in our existing equity method Affiliates.Equity method intangible amortization increased $7.5 million or 53% in the three months ended March 31, 2017, primarily due to a $6.3 million or 44% increase due to our 2016 investments in new Affiliates. Other Non-Operating (Income) and ExpensesThe following table summarizes non-operating income and expense data: For the Three Months Ended March 31,  (in millions)2016 2017 % ChangeInvestment and other income$(4.0) $(13.5) N.M.

(1)Income taxes57.0 59.7 5 %___________________________(1) Percentage change is not meaningful.Investment and other income increased $9.5 million in the three months ended March 31, 2017, primarily due to an increase in realized gains on the sale of available-for-sale securities of $4.5 million and increases in the fair value of investments of $4.1 million. There were no significant changes in Interest expense in the three months ended March 31, 2017.25Imputed interest expense and contingent payment arrangements increased $2.8 million in the three months ended March 31, 2017. This increase was the result of a $2.8 million gain on the revaluation of a contingent payment arrangement in the three months ended March 31, 2016, which did not reoccur. Income taxes increased $2.7 million or 5% in the three months ended March 31, 2017, principally from an increase in Income before income taxes attributable to the controlling interest, partially offset by stock compensation-related windfall tax benefits, as well as an increase in the indefinite reinvestment of certain foreign earnings.Net Income The previously discussed changes in Revenue, expenses and Income from equity method investments had the following effect on Net income: For the Three Months Ended March 31,  (in millions)2016 2017 % ChangeNet income$173.5 $193.6 12%Net income (non-controlling interests)69.5 71.1 2%Net income (controlling interest)104.0 122.5 18%Supplemental Financial Performance Measures Adjusted EBITDA (controlling interest)As supplemental information, we provide a non-GAAP measure that we refer to as Adjusted EBITDA (controlling interest). Adjusted EBITDA (controlling interest) represents our earnings before our share of interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, amortization, impairments and adjustments to our contingent payment obligations. We believe that many investors use this information when assessing the financial performance of companies in the investment management industry. This non-GAAP performance measure is provided in addition to, but not as a substitute for, Net income (controlling interest) or any other GAAP measures of financial performance. The following table provides a reconciliation of Net income (controlling interest) to Adjusted EBITDA (controlling interest): For the Three Months Ended March 31,(in millions)2016 2017Net income (controlling interest)$104.0 $122.5Interest expense22.3 21.9Imputed interest expense and contingent payment arrangements(1)(2.0) 0.8Income taxes55.1 57.8Depreciation and other amortization1.9 2.3Intangible amortization and impairments(2)34.4 38.5Adjusted EBITDA (controlling interest)$215.7 $243.8___________________________(1) In the first quarter of 2016, we adjusted our estimate of a contingent payment obligation and, accordingly, recorded a gain attributable to the controlling interest of $2.8 million. This gain is included in Imputed interest expense and contingent payment arrangements. (2) Our reported intangible amortization includes amortization attributable to our non-controlling interests. For our equity method Affiliates, we do not separately report intangible amortization in our Consolidated Statements of Income. Our share of these Affiliates’ amortization is reported in Income from equity method investments. The following table summarizes the Intangible amortization and impairments shown above:26 For the Three Months Ended March 31,(in millions)2016 2017Reported Intangible amortization and impairments$26.6 $21.9Intangible amortization (non-controlling interests)(6.4) (5.1)Equity method intangible amortization14.2 21.7Total$34.4 $38.5Economic Net Income (controlling interest) and Economic Earnings Per ShareAs supplemental information, we also provide non-GAAP performance measures that we refer to as Economic net income (controlling interest) and Economic earnings per share. We consider Economic net income (controlling interest) and Economic earnings per share to be important measures of our financial performance, as we believe they best represent our performance before our share of non-cash expenses relating to our acquisition of interests in our Affiliates, and it is therefore employed as our principal performance measure. Economic net income (controlling interest) and Economic earnings per share are used by our management and Board of Directors as our principal performance benchmarks, including as one of the measures for aligning executive compensation with stockholder value. These measures are provided in addition to, but not as substitutes for, other GAAP measures of financial performance, such as Net income (controlling interest) and Earnings per share (diluted).Under our Economic net income (controlling interest) definition, we add to Net income (controlling interest) our share of pre-tax intangible amortization and impairments (including the portion attributable to equity method Affiliates), deferred taxes related to intangible assets, and other economic items, which include non-cash imputed interest (principally related to the accounting for convertible securities and contingent payment arrangements) and certain Affiliate equity expenses. We add back intangible amortization and impairments attributable to acquired client relationships because these expenses do not correspond to the changes in value of these assets, which do not diminish predictably over time. The portion of deferred taxes generally attributable to intangible assets (including goodwill) is added back because we believe it is unlikely these accruals will be used to settle material tax obligations. We add back non-cash imputed interest and reductions or increases in contingent payment arrangements to better reflect our contractual interest obligations. We add back non-cash expenses relating to certain transfers of equity between Affiliate partners when these transfers have no dilutive effect to shareholders.Economic earnings per share represents Economic net income (controlling interest) divided by the Average shares outstanding (adjusted diluted). In this calculation, the potential share issuance in connection with our convertible securities is measured using a “treasury stock” method. Under this method, only the net number of shares of common stock equal to the value of these convertible securities in excess of par, if any, is deemed to be outstanding. We believe the inclusion of net shares under a treasury stock method best reflects the benefit of the increase in available capital resources (which could be used to repurchase shares of common stock) that occurs when these securities are converted and we are relieved of our debt obligation. This method does not take into account any increase or decrease in our cost of capital in an assumed conversion.The following table provides a reconciliation of Net income (controlling interest) to Economic net income (controlling interest): For the Three Months Ended March 31,(in millions, except per share data)2016 2017Net income (controlling interest)$104.0 $122.5Intangible amortization and impairments(1)34.4 38.5Intangible-related deferred taxes22.1 19.8Other economic items(2)(3)(1.2) 2.4Economic net income (controlling interest)$159.3 $183.2Average shares outstanding (diluted)56.6 59.2Assumed issuance of junior convertible securities shares(2.2) (2.2)Average shares outstanding (adjusted diluted)54.4 57.0Economic earnings per share$2.92 $3.21____________________________(1) See note (2) to the table in “Adjusted EBITDA (controlling interest).”  27(2) For the three months ended March 31, 2016, Other economic items were net of an income tax benefit of $0.7 million. For the three months ended March 31, 2017, Other economic items were net of income tax expense of $0.3 million. (3) In the first quarter of 2016, we adjusted our estimate of a contingent payment obligation and, accordingly, recorded a gain attributable to the controlling interest of $2.8 million ($1.7 million net of tax). This gain is included in Imputed interest expense and contingent payment arrangements. Liquidity and Capital ResourcesDuring the three months ended March 31, 2017, we met our cash requirements primarily through cash generated by operating activities. Our principal uses of cash during the quarter were, and for the foreseeable future are expected to be, for repayments of senior debt, distributions to Affiliate equity holders, repurchases of common stock, the payment of cash dividends on our common stock, and general working capital purposes. We also expect that a principal use of cash will be for investments in new and existing Affiliates. We anticipate that cash flows from operations, together with borrowings under our revolver and proceeds from our equity distribution program, will be sufficient to support our cash flow needs for the foreseeable future.Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2016 and March 31, 2017 were $430.8 million and $293.6 million, respectively, including $18.9 million and $23.8 million, respectively, in our wholly owned foreign subsidiaries, which could be repatriated without accruing or paying any significant additional U.S. taxes.The following summarizes our cash flow activities: For the Three Months Ended March 31,(in millions)2016 2017Operating cash flow$25.6 $122.1Investing cash flow(550.9) 16.3Financing cash flow259.8 (277.4)Operating Cash FlowIn the three months ended March 31, 2017, Cash flow from operating activities increased $96.5 million, of which approximately 70% was attributable to the controlling interest. Cash flow from operating activities attributable to the controlling interest increased primarily from the receipt of cash distributions of our equity method earnings from our 2016 new investments.Investing Cash FlowNet cash flow from investing activities, which is primarily attributable to the controlling interest, increased $567.2 million in the three months ended March 31, 2017, primarily due to a decrease in Investments in Affiliates of $546.6 million and an increase in Sale of investment securities of $24.1 million.Financing Cash Flow Net cash flow used in financing activities, which is primarily attributable to the controlling interest, increased $537.2 million in the three months ended March 31, 2017. This increase was primarily due to a change in the senior debt activity from net borrowings of $420.0 million in the three months ended March 31, 2016 to net repayments of $85.0 million in the three months ended March 31, 2017, and an increase in repurchases of common stock of $63.1 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in Affiliate equity repurchases of $36.5 million.The following table summarizes the carrying value of our outstanding indebtedness:(in millions)December 31, 2016 March 31, 2017Senior bank debt$870.0 $785.0Senior notes945.1 945.3Convertible securities307.5 308.028Senior Bank DebtWe have a $1.45 billion senior unsecured multicurrency revolving credit facility (the “revolver”) and a $385.0 million senior unsecured term loan facility (the “term loan” and, together with the revolver, the “credit facilities”). The credit facilities both mature on September 30, 2020.The credit facilities contain financial covenants with respect to leverage and interest coverage, as well as customary affirmative and negative covenants, including limitations on priority indebtedness, asset dispositions and fundamental corporate changes, and certain customary events of default. As of March 31, 2017, we were in compliance with all terms of our credit facilities and had approximately $1.1 billion of remaining capacity under our revolver, all of which we could borrow and remain in compliance with our credit facilities. We are currently rated A3 by Moody’s Investors Service and BBB+ with a positive outlook by S&P Global Ratings. A downgrade of our credit rating, including a downgrade to below investment grade, would not trigger a default or have any other significant impact on the terms of our existing credit facilities. A reduction in our credit rating could, however, increase our borrowing costs. Additionally, a downgrade of our credit rating below investment grade in connection with a change in control would require us to make a repurchase offer on certain of our senior notes.Equity Distribution ProgramIn 2016, we entered into equity distribution and forward equity agreements with several major securities firms under which we, from time to time, may issue and sell shares of our common stock (immediately or on a forward basis) having an aggregate sales price of up to $500.0 million (the “equity distribution program”). As of March 31, 2017, no sales have occurred under the equity distribution program. Affiliate EquityMany of our Affiliate agreements provide us with a conditional right to call and Affiliate equity holders with the conditional right to put their Affiliate equity interests to us at certain intervals. For equity method Affiliates, we do not typically have such put and call arrangements. The purchase price of these conditional purchases is generally calculated based upon a multiple of the Affiliate’s cash flow distributions, which is intended to represent fair value. Affiliate equity holders are also permitted to sell their equity interests to other individuals or entities in certain cases, subject to our approval or other restrictions.As of March 31, 2017, our current redemption value of $733.5 million for these interests has been presented as Redeemable non-controlling interests. Although the timing and amounts of these purchases are difficult to predict, we repurchased $99.6 million of Affiliate equity during the three months ended March 31, 2017, and expect to repurchase a total of approximately $125 million in 2017. In the event of a repurchase, we would become the owner of the cash flow associated with the repurchased equity.CommitmentsWe have committed to co-invest in certain investment partnerships.
