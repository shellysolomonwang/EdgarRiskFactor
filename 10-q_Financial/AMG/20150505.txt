Item 1A. Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014.These factors (among others) could affect our financial performance and cause actual results to differ materially from historical earnings and those presently anticipated and projected. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we will not undertake and we specifically disclaim any obligation to release publicly the result of any revisions which may be made to any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements or to reflect the occurrence of events, whether or not anticipated. In that respect, we caution readers not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements.Management's Discussion and Analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.Executive OverviewWe are a global asset management company with equity investments in leading boutique investment management firms, which we refer to as our "Affiliates." We pursue a growth strategy designed to generate shareholder value through the growth of our existing Affiliates, as well as through additional investments in boutique investment management firms. In addition, we provide centralized assistance to our Affiliates in strategic matters, marketing, distribution, product development and operations. As of March 31, 2015, we managed $632.2 billion in assets through our Affiliates (approximately $638 billion pro forma for the investment in Baker Street Advisors, which closed on April 1, 2015) across a broad range of asset classes and investment styles in three principal distribution channels: Institutional, Mutual Fund and High Net Worth. We believe that our diversification across distribution channels, Affiliates, asset classes, investment styles and geographies helps to mitigate our exposure to the risks created by changing market environments. The following summarizes our operations in our three principal distribution channels.•In the Institutional distribution channel, we manage assets for large institutional investors world-wide, including sovereign wealth funds, foundations, endowments and retirement plans for corporations and municipalities.•In the Mutual Fund distribution channel, we provide advisory or sub-advisory services to mutual funds, UCITS and other retail-oriented products. These funds are distributed to retail and institutional clients directly and through intermediaries, including independent investment advisors, retirement plan sponsors, broker-dealers, major fund marketplaces and bank trust departments.•In the High Net Worth distribution channel, we provide advisory services to ultra-high net worth individuals, family trusts and high net worth individuals through managed account relationships with intermediaries. Direct services to these clients include customized investment counseling, investment management and fiduciary services.Our Structure and Relationship with AffiliatesWe establish and maintain long-term partnerships with our Affiliates, believing that Affiliate equity ownership (along with our ownership) aligns our interests and provides a powerful incentive for the principal owners of our Affiliates to continue to grow their businesses. Our partnership approach allows for the principal owners of our Affiliates to retain equity sufficient to address their particular needs and to maintain operational autonomy in managing their businesses, thereby preserving their entrepreneurial culture and independence. Although the equity structure of each investment is tailored to meet the needs of a particular Affiliate, in all cases, we maintain a meaningful equity interest in the firm, with the remaining equity interests retained by Affiliate management. 18The contractual structures of our investments vary from Affiliate to Affiliate, reflecting our tailored partnership approach. Where we own a majority of the equity interests of a firm, we typically use structures referred to as revenue sharing arrangements where a percentage of revenue is allocable to fund operating expenses, including compensation (the "Operating Allocation"), while the remaining revenue (the "Owners' Allocation") is allocable to us and Affiliate management. In other revenue sharing arrangements, we own a minority interest that allocates a percentage of the Affiliate's revenue to us, with the remaining revenue available to the Affiliate to pay operating expenses and profit distributions to the other owners. Under our revenue sharing arrangements, our contractual share of revenue generally has priority over allocations to Affiliate management. Certain of our Affiliates operate under profit-based arrangements through which we receive a share of profits as cash flow, rather than a percentage of revenue through a typical revenue sharing agreement. As a result, we participate in increases or decreases in the margin of such firms. From time to time, we may consider changes to the structure of our relationship with an Affiliate in order to better support the Affiliate's growth strategy.Financial ResultsFor the three months ended March 31, 2015, Net income (controlling interest) was $128.0 million, and Earnings per share (diluted) was $2.28, representing a 63% increase over the prior year. For the three months ended March 31, 2014, Net income (controlling interest) was $77.2 million, and Earnings per share (diluted) was $1.40. For the three months ended March 31, 2015, Economic net income (controlling interest) was $162.1 million, Economic earnings per share was $2.91, representing a 17% increase over the prior year, and EBITDA (controlling interest) was $221.0 million. For the three months ended March 31, 2014, Economic net income (controlling interest) was $137.9 million, Economic earnings per share was $2.48 and EBITDA (controlling interest) was $191.9 million. Economic net income (controlling interest), including Economic earnings per share, and EBITDA (controlling interest) are non-GAAP performance measures and are discussed in "Supplemental Performance Measures."For the twelve months ended March 31, 2015, our assets under management increased 14% to $632.2 billion. The increase was primarily the result of $37.2 billion from new investments, $19.8 billion from organic growth from net client cash flows and $15.2 billion from market changes. The table below summarizes our financial highlights: As of and for the Three Months Ended March 31,  (in millions, except as noted and per share data)2014 2015 % ChangeAssets under management (in billions)$556.8 $632.2 14%Average assets under management (in billions)540.6 623.5 15%Revenue593.1 635.0 7%Net income (controlling interest)77.2 128.0 66%Earnings per share (diluted)1.40 2.28 63%Economic net income (controlling interest)(1)137.9 162.1 18%Economic earnings per share(1)2.48 2.91 17%EBITDA (controlling interest)(1)191.9 221.0 15%___________________________(1) Economic net income (controlling interest), including Economic earnings per share, and EBITDA (controlling interest) are non-GAAP performance measures and are discussed in "Supplemental Performance Measures."Supplemental Performance Measures Economic Net Income (controlling interest)As supplemental information, we provide non-GAAP performance measures that we refer to as Economic net income (controlling interest) and Economic earnings per share. We consider Economic net income (controlling interest) an important measure of our financial performance, as we believe it best represents our operating performance before our share of non-cash expenses relating to our acquisition of interests in our Affiliates. Economic net income (controlling interest) and Economic earnings per share are used by our management and Board of Directors as our principal performance benchmarks, including as one of the measures for aligning executive compensation with stockholder value. These measures are provided in addition to, 19but not as a substitute for, Net income (controlling interest) and Earnings per share (diluted), or any other GAAP measure of financial performance or liquidity.Under our Economic net income (controlling interest) definition, we add to Net income (controlling interest) our share of amortization (including equity method amortization) and impairments, deferred taxes related to intangible assets, and other economic items which include non-cash imputed interest expense (principally related to the accounting for convertible securities and contingent payment arrangements) and certain Affiliate equity expenses. We add back amortization and impairments attributable to acquired client relationships because these expenses do not correspond to the changes in value of these assets, which do not diminish predictably over time. The portion of deferred taxes generally attributable to intangible assets (including goodwill) is added back because we believe it is unlikely these accruals will be used to settle material tax obligations. We add back non-cash imputed interest expense and reductions or increases in contingent payment arrangements because it better reflects our contractual interest obligations. We add back non-cash expenses relating to certain transfers of equity between Affiliate partners when these transfers have no dilutive effect to shareholders.Economic earnings per share represents Economic net income (controlling interest) divided by the average shares outstanding (adjusted diluted). In this calculation, the potential share issuance in connection with our convertible securities is measured using a "treasury stock" method. Under this method, only the net number of shares of common stock equal to the value of these securities in excess of par, if any, are deemed to be outstanding. We believe the inclusion of net shares under a treasury stock method best reflects the benefit of the increase in available capital resources (which could be used to repurchase shares of common stock) that occurs when these securities are converted and we are relieved of our debt obligation. This method does not take into account any increase or decrease in our cost of capital in an assumed conversion.The following table provides a reconciliation of Net income (controlling interest) to Economic net income (controlling interest): For the Three Months Ended March 31,(in millions, except per share data)2014 2015Net income (controlling interest)$77.2 $128.0Intangible amortization and impairments(1)27.3 29.8Intangible-related deferred taxes16.9 20.4Other economic items(2)16.5 (16.1)Economic net income (controlling interest)$137.9 $162.1Average shares outstanding (diluted)55.2 57.8Assumed issuance of junior convertible securities shares— (2.2)Dilutive impact of junior convertible securities shares0.4 0.1Average shares outstanding (adjusted diluted)55.6 55.7Economic earnings per share$2.48 $2.91____________________________(1) Our reported intangible amortization includes amortization attributable to our non-controlling interests, amounts not added back to Net income (controlling interest) to measure our Economic net income (controlling interest). Further, for our equity method Affiliates, we do not separately report revenue or expenses (including intangible amortization) in our Consolidated Statements of Income. Our share of these Affiliates' amortization is reported in Income from equity method investments. The following table summarizes the Intangible amortization and impairments shown above: For the Three Months Ended March 31,(in millions)2014 2015Reported Intangible amortization and impairments$27.4 $27.8Intangible amortization (non-controlling interests)(5.5) (6.8)Equity method intangible amortization5.4 8.8Total$27.3 $29.8         ____________________________20(2) During the three months ended March 31, 2014, we settled our 2006 junior convertible securities and recognized an expense of $18.8 million ($11.6 million net of tax) upon redemption, which was included in Imputed interest expense and contingent payment arrangements in the Consolidated Statements of Income. During the three months ended March 31, 2015, we adjusted our estimate of our contingent payment obligations and, accordingly, recorded a pre-tax gain attributable to the controlling interest of $29.8 million ($18.5 million net of tax). EBITDA (controlling interest)As supplemental information, we also provide a non-GAAP measure referred to as EBITDA (controlling interest). EBITDA (controlling interest) represents the controlling interest's operating performance before our share of interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. We believe that many investors use this information when comparing the financial performance of companies in the investment management industry. EBITDA, as calculated by us, may not be consistent with computations of EBITDA by other companies. This non-GAAP performance measure is provided in addition to, but not as a substitute for, Net income (controlling interest) or any other GAAP measure of financial performance or liquidity.The following table provides a reconciliation of Net income (controlling interest) to EBITDA (controlling interest): For the Three Months Ended March 31,(in millions)2014 2015Net income (controlling interest)$77.2 $128.0Interest expense17.6 22.2Imputed interest expense and contingent payment arrangements(1)22.5 (27.2)Income taxes45.6 66.3Depreciation and other amortization1.7 1.9Intangible amortization and impairments(2)27.3 29.8EBITDA (controlling interest)$191.9 $221.0___________________________(1) During the three months ended March 31, 2014, we settled our 2006 junior convertible securities and recognized an expense of $18.8 million upon redemption, which was included in Imputed interest expense and contingent payment arrangements in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Assets under Management The following table presents changes in our Affiliates' reported assets under management by distribution channel:Statement of Changes(in billions)Institutional Mutual Fund High Net Worth TotalDecember 31, 2014$355.6 $188.4 $76.2 $620.2Client cash inflows13.0 13.8 3.4 30.2Client cash outflows(10.1) (12.4) (2.4) (24.9)Net client cash flows2.9 1.4 1.0 5.3Market changes1.5 3.9 1.3 6.7Other(1)(0.0) — — (0.0)March 31, 2015$360.0 $193.7 $78.5 $632.2___________________________(1) Includes assets under management attributable to Affiliate product transitions, new investment client transitions and transfers of our interests in certain Affiliated investment management firms, the financial effects of which are not significant to our ongoing results. 21The distribution channel analysis presented in the following table is based on average assets under management. For the Mutual Fund distribution channel, average assets under management represent an average of the daily net assets under management. For the Institutional and High Net Worth distribution channels, average assets under management reflect the billing patterns of particular client accounts. For example, assets under management for an account that bills in advance is presented in the table on the basis of beginning of period assets under management while an account that bills in arrears is reflected on the basis of end of period assets under management. Assets under management attributable to any investment in new Affiliates are included on a weighted average basis for the period from the closing date of the respective investment. We believe that this analysis more closely correlates to the billing cycle of each distribution channel and, as such, provides a more meaningful relationship to revenue.

When we own a controlling interest, we consolidate the Affiliate's results. Our discussion of revenue and operating expenses relates to our consolidated Affiliates.When we hold a minority investment and are required to use the equity method of accounting, we do not consolidate the operating results of these firms (including their revenue). Our share of these firms' earnings (net of intangible amortization) is reported in Income from equity method investments.22RevenueThrough our Affiliates, we derive most of our revenue from investment management services. Investment management fees ("asset-based fees") are typically determined as a percentage fee charged on the value of a client's assets under management. Our private equity products generally bill for their services based on a percentage of committed or invested capital.In addition, certain Affiliate alternative and equity products bill on the basis of investment performance, typically on an absolute basis or relative to a benchmark ("performance fees"). Absolute basis products, which are primarily in the Institutional distribution channel, are often structured to have returns that are not directly correlated to changes in broader equity indices. Performance fees are typically billed less frequently than an asset-based fee and although performance fees inherently depend on investment performance and will vary from period to period, we anticipate performance fees will be a recurring component of our revenue.Our revenue is generally determined by the level of our average assets under management and the composition of our assets across our distribution channels and products within our distribution channels, which realize different fee rates. Our ratio of asset-based fees to average assets under management (in total and by channel) is calculated as asset-based fees divided by average assets under management and may change as a result of new investments, net client cash flows, investment performance or changes in contractual fees. Therefore, changes in this ratio should not necessarily be viewed as an indicator of changes in contractual fee rates billed by our Affiliates to their clients.Our revenue increased $41.9 million or 7% in the three months ended March 31, 2015, primarily from an 11% increase in average assets under management at our consolidated Affiliates. Increases in average assets under management from our 2014 investments in new Affiliates increased revenue $50.9 million or 8% and net client cash flows and market changes at existing Affiliates increased revenue $5.9 million or 1%. These increases were partially offset by a decline in our ratio of asset-based fees to average assets under management which reduced revenue by $14.9 million or 2%. The decline in our ratio of revenue to average assets under management resulted from changes in the composition of our assets under management, including decreases in assets under management in certain products that realize comparatively higher fee rates and increases in assets under management in certain products that realize comparatively lower fees. The following discusses the changes in our revenue by distribution channel.Institutional Distribution ChannelOur revenue in the Institutional distribution channel increased $8.0 million or 3% in the three months ended March 31, 2015, primarily from an 8% increase in average assets under management at our consolidated Affiliates. Increases in average assets under management from our 2014 investments in new Affiliates increased revenue $16.6 million or 6% and net client cash flows and market changes at existing Affiliates increased revenue $1.8 million or 1%. These increases were partially offset by a decline in our ratio of asset-based fees to average assets under management which reduced revenue by $10.4 million or 4%. The decline in our ratio of revenue to average assets under management resulted from changes in the composition of our assets under management within the channel, including decreases in assets under management in certain products that realize comparatively higher fee rates and increases in assets under management in certain products that realize comparatively lower fees. Mutual Fund Distribution ChannelOur revenue in the Mutual Fund distribution channel increased $26.4 million or 9% in the three months ended March 31, 2015, primarily from an 11% increase in average assets under management at our consolidated Affiliates. Increases in average assets under management from our 2014 investments in new Affiliates increased revenue $29.1 million or 9%. Net client cash flows and market changes at existing Affiliates decreased revenue $2.7 million or less than 1%. High Net Worth Distribution ChannelOur revenue in the High Net Worth distribution channel increased $7.5 million or 13% in the three months ended March 31, 2015, primarily from a 17% increase in average assets under management at our consolidated Affiliates. Increases in average assets under management from our 2014 investments in new Affiliates increased revenue $5.3 million or 8% and net client cash flows and market changes at existing Affiliates increased revenue $4.1 million or 7%. These increases were partially offset by a decline in our ratio of revenue to average assets under management which reduced revenue by $1.9 million or 2%. The decline in our ratio of asset-based fees to average assets under management resulted from changes in the composition of our assets under management within the channel, including decreases in assets under management in certain products that realize comparatively higher fee rates and increases in assets under management in certain products that realize comparatively lower fees. 23Operating ExpensesThe following table summarizes our consolidated operating expenses: For the Three Months Ended March 31,   % Change(in millions)2014 2015 Compensation and related expenses$235.7 $252.8 7 %Selling, general and administrative122.3 108.7 (11)%Intangible amortization and impairments27.4 27.8 1 %Depreciation and other amortization3.8 4.4 16 %Other operating expenses9.9 9.9 — %Total operating expenses$399.1 $403.6 1 %A substantial portion of our operating expenses was incurred by our Affiliates, the majority of which was incurred by Affiliates with revenue sharing arrangements through the Operating Allocation. Compensation and related expenses increased $17.1 million or 7% in the three months ended March 31, 2015, primarily as a result of increases in compensation expense from our 2014 investments in new Affiliates of $18.3 million. This increase was partially offset by a $0.7 million decrease in both compensation expense at existing Affiliates as well as Affiliate equity compensation expense.Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $13.6 million or 11% in the three months ended March 31, 2015, primarily from decreases in sub-advisory and distribution expenses of $8.8 million at our Affiliates in the Mutual Fund distribution channel and a decrease in acquisition-related professional fees of $3.1 million. Intangible amortization and impairments increased $0.4 million or 1% in the three months ended March 31, 2015, primarily as a result of a $3.3 million increase in amortization resulting from our 2014 investments in new Affiliates, partially offset by a $2.9 million decrease in amortization from extant Affiliates.Income from Equity Method InvestmentsWhen we own a minority investment and are required to use the equity method of accounting, we only recognize our share of these Affiliates' earnings net of intangible amortization. Accordingly, we have not consolidated these Affiliates' operating results (including their revenue). The following table summarizes our share of the profits from our equity method investments: For the Three Months Ended March 31,  (in millions)2014 2015 % ChangeEquity method earnings$51.6 $61.9 20%Equity method amortization5.4 8.8 63%Income from equity method investments$46.2 $53.1 15%Equity method earnings increased $10.3 million or 20% in the three months ended March 31, 2015, primarily as a result of our 2014 investments in new and existing Affiliates of $10.4 million, as well as increases in average assets under management at extant Affiliates. This increase was partially offset by a decline in performance fees. Equity method amortization increased $3.4 million or 63% in the three months ended March 31, 2015, primarily as a result of a $5.6 million increase in intangible amortization from our 2014 investments in new and existing Affiliates, partially offset by a $2.0 million decrease due to certain assets being fully amortized in 2014.Other Income Statement DataThe following table summarizes other income statement data:24 For the Three Months Ended March 31,  (in millions)2014 2015 % ChangeInvestment and other income$8.2 $0.8 (90)%Interest expense17.6 22.2 26 %Imputed interest and contingent payment arrangements22.5 (27.2) (221)%Income tax expense48.9 69.6 42 %Investment and other income decreased $7.4 million or 90% in the three months ended March 31, 2015, principally as a result of decreases in the fair value of investments.Interest expense increased $4.6 million or 26% in the three months ended March 31, 2015, primarily as a result of the issuance of our senior notes in February 2015 and 2014, which collectively increased interest expense by $4.3 million. Imputed interest and contingent payment arrangements decreased $49.7 million or 221% in the three months ended March 31, 2015. This decrease was primarily a result of a $29.8 million gain on revaluation of contingent payment arrangements in the three months ended March 31, 2015 and an $18.8 million decrease in imputed interest expense from the settlement of our 2006 junior convertible securities in the three months ended March 31, 2014, which did not reoccur in the three months ended March 31, 2015.Income tax expense increased $20.7 million or 42% in the three months ended March 31, 2015, principally from an increase in Income before income taxes attributable to the controlling interest. This increase was offset by a decrease in our effective tax rate from 37.1% to 34.1%, primarily from the 2014 restructuring of certain non-U.S. entities and an indefinite reinvestment of $6.3 million of non-U.S. earnings in the three months ended March 31, 2015.Net Income The previously discussed changes in revenue and expenses had the following effect on Net income: For the Three Months Ended March 31,  (in millions)2014 2015 % ChangeNet income$159.4 $220.7 38%Net income (non-controlling interests)82.2 92.7 13%Net income (controlling interest)77.2 128.0 66%Liquidity and Capital ResourcesDuring the three months ended March 31, 2015, we met our cash requirements primarily through cash generated by operating activities and the proceeds from the issuance of the 2025 senior notes, which were used to pay down our Senior bank debt. Our principal uses of cash were to repurchase shares of our common stock and make distributions to Affiliate partners.We expect that our principal uses of cash for the foreseeable future will be for investments in new and existing Affiliates, distributions to Affiliate partners, share repurchases, payment of principal and interest on outstanding debt, settlement of our junior convertible securities and general working capital purposes. We anticipate that cash flows from operations, together with borrowings under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the "credit facility") and proceeds from any forward equity transactions, will be sufficient to support our cash flow needs for the foreseeable future. Cash and cash equivalents were $550.6 million and $438.2 million at December 31, 2014 and March 31, 2015, respectively. During the three months ended March 31, 2015, we did not provide for U.S. federal and state income taxes on approximately $6.3 million of undistributed earnings of our foreign entities. Such earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested outside the United States. The following summarizes our cash flow activity for the three months ended March 31, 2014 and 2015. 25 For the Three Months Ended March 31,(in millions)2014 2015Operating cash flow$297.7 $119.1Investing cash flow(114.3) (4.3)Financing cash flow94.1 (217.5)Operating Cash FlowThe decrease in cash flows from operations in the three months ended March 31, 2015 resulted principally from a $132.6 million decrease in payables, accrued liabilities and other liabilities and a $54.4 million decrease in distributions from equity method investments.Investing Cash FlowNet cash flow used in investing activities decreased $110.0 million in the three months ended March 31, 2015, primarily due to a decrease in investments in Affiliates of $108.9 million.Financing Cash FlowNet cash flow used in financing activities increased $311.6 million in the three months ended March 31, 2015, primarily as a result of a $243.6 million decrease in net borrowings of senior debt and a $197.8 million increase in repurchases of common stock in the three months ended March 31, 2015, partially offset by a $104.4 million decrease in distributions to non-controlling interests.The following table summarizes certain key financial data relating to our outstanding indebtedness:(in millions)December 31, 2014 March 31, 2015Senior bank debt$855.0 $535.0Senior notes736.8 1,084.2Convertible securities303.1 303.6Senior Bank DebtWe have a $1.25 billion credit facility, which matures in April 2018, and a $250.0 million five-year senior unsecured term loan which matures in 2019. As of March 31, 2015, the outstanding balance under the credit facility was $285.0 million.The credit facility and term loan contain financial covenants with respect to leverage and interest coverage, as well as customary affirmative and negative covenants, including limitations on priority indebtedness, liens, cash dividends, asset dispositions, fundamental corporate changes and certain customary events of default. We were in compliance with all terms of both our credit facility and term loan. We could borrow all remaining capacity and continue to be in compliance.Senior NotesOn February 13, 2015, we issued $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.50% senior unsecured notes due 2025. The 2025 senior notes pay interest semi-annually and may be redeemed at any time, in whole or in part, at a make-whole redemption price plus accrued and unpaid interest. In addition to customary event of default provisions, the indenture limits our ability to consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets. The net proceeds were used to repay existing borrowings under our credit facility.Forward EquityUnder a forward equity agreement, we had $252.8 million remaining notional amount of shares of our common stock that we may elect to sell as of March 31, 2015. 26Affiliate EquityMany of our operating agreements provide us with a conditional right to call and Affiliate partners the conditional right to put their retained equity interests at certain intervals. In cases where we own a minority interest, we do not typically have such put and call arrangements. The purchase price of these conditional purchases is generally calculated based upon a multiple of the Affiliate's cash flow distributions, which is intended to represent fair value. Affiliate management partners are also permitted to sell their equity interests to other individuals or entities in certain cases, subject to our approval or other restrictions.Our current redemption value of $743.2 million for these interests has been presented as Redeemable non-controlling interests on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Although the timing and amounts of these purchases are difficult to predict, we expect to repurchase approximately $75.0 million of Affiliate equity during 2015, and, in such event, will own the cash flow associated with any equity repurchased.CommitmentsWe have committed to co-invest in certain investment partnerships. As of March 31, 2015, these unfunded commitments totaled approximately $66.4 million and may be called in future periods. In connection with a past acquisition agreement, we are contractually entitled to reimbursement from a prior owner for $19.3 million of these commitments if they are called.Under past acquisition agreements, we are contingently liable, upon achievement of specified financial targets, to make payments of up to $276.0 million through 2017. In 2015, we expect to make payments of $40.0 million associated with these contingent arrangements.Share RepurchasesOur Board of Directors has periodically authorized share repurchase programs, most recently in May 2015 (see Item 5 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q).

Please refer to Item 7A in our 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Item 4.Controls and ProceduresWe carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures during the quarter covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the quarter covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective in ensuring that (i) the information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms, and (ii) such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, we recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and our management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating and implementing possible controls and procedures. Our disclosure controls and procedures were designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their stated objectives and our principal executive officer and principal financial officers concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective at the reasonable assurance level. We review on an ongoing basis and document our disclosure controls and procedures, and our internal control over financial reporting, and we may from time to time make changes in an effort to enhance their effectiveness and ensure that our systems evolve with our business.No change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) occurred during the quarter covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.28PART II—OTHER INFORMATIONItem 2.Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
