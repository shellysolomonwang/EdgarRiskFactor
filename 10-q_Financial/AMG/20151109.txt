Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014.These factors (among others) could affect our financial performance and cause actual results to differ materially from historical earnings and those presently anticipated and projected. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we will not undertake and we specifically disclaim any obligation to release publicly the result of any revisions which may be made to any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements or to reflect the occurrence of events, whether or not anticipated. In that respect, we caution readers not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements.Management’s Discussion and Analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.Executive OverviewWe are a global asset management company with equity investments in leading boutique investment management firms, which we refer to as our “Affiliates.” We pursue a growth strategy designed to generate shareholder value through the growth of our existing Affiliates, as well as through additional investments in boutique investment management firms. In addition, we provide centralized assistance to our Affiliates in strategic matters, marketing, distribution, product development and operations. As of September 30, 2015, we managed $593.8 billion in assets (approximately $619 billion including pending investments, as well as an investment which has since closed) across a broad range of asset classes and investment styles in three principal distribution channels: Institutional, Mutual Fund and High Net Worth. We believe that our diversification across distribution channels, Affiliates, asset classes, investment styles and geographies helps to mitigate our exposure to the risks created by changing market environments. The following summarizes our operations in our three principal distribution channels.•In the Institutional distribution channel, we manage assets for large institutional investors worldwide, including sovereign wealth funds, foundations, endowments and retirement plans for corporations and municipalities.•In the Mutual Fund distribution channel, we provide advisory or sub-advisory services to mutual funds, UCITS and other retail-oriented products. These funds are distributed to retail and institutional clients directly and through intermediaries, including independent investment advisors, retirement plan sponsors, broker-dealers, major fund marketplaces and bank trust departments.•In the High Net Worth distribution channel, we provide advisory services to ultra-high net worth individuals, family trusts and high net worth individuals through managed account relationships with intermediaries. Direct services to these clients include customized investment counseling, investment management and fiduciary services.Our Structure and Relationship with AffiliatesWe establish and maintain long-term partnerships with our Affiliates, believing that Affiliate equity ownership (along with our ownership) aligns our interests and provides a powerful incentive for the principal owners of our Affiliates to continue to grow their businesses. Our partnership approach allows for the principal owners of our Affiliates to retain equity sufficient to address their particular needs and to maintain operational autonomy in managing their businesses, thereby preserving their entrepreneurial culture and independence. Although the equity structure of each investment is tailored to meet the needs of a particular Affiliate, in all cases we maintain a meaningful equity interest in the firm, with the remaining equity interests retained by Affiliate management. 18The contractual structures of our investments vary from Affiliate to Affiliate, reflecting our tailored partnership approach. Where we own a majority of the equity interests of a firm, we typically use structures referred to as revenue sharing arrangements where a percentage of revenue is allocable to fund operating expenses, including compensation (the “Operating Allocation”), while the remaining revenue (the “Owners’ Allocation”) is allocable to us and Affiliate management. In other revenue sharing arrangements, we own a minority interest that allocates a percentage of the Affiliate’s revenue to us, with the remaining revenue available to the Affiliate to pay operating expenses and profit distributions to the other owners. Under our revenue sharing arrangements, our contractual share of revenue generally has priority over allocations to Affiliate management. Certain of our Affiliates operate under profit-based arrangements through which we receive a distribution of net profits, rather than a percentage of revenue through a typical revenue sharing agreement. As a result, we participate in increases or decreases in the margin of such firms. From time to time, we may consider changes to the structure of our relationship with an Affiliate in order to better support the Affiliate’s growth strategy.New InvestmentsOn October 1, 2015, we completed a majority equity interest in myCIO Wealth Partners, LLC.On November 8, 2015, we announced that we will acquire minority equity interests in Systematica Investments LP, Abax Investments (Pty) Ltd and Ivory Investment Management, L.P. Financial ResultsFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, Net income (controlling interest) was $109.0 million and $365.7 million, respectively, compared to $103.2 million and $279.5 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, Earnings per share (diluted) was $1.98 and $6.57, respectively, compared to $1.82 and $4.98 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, Economic net income (controlling interest) was $160.8 million and $494.2 million, respectively, Economic earnings per share was $2.93 and $8.93, respectively, and EBITDA (controlling interest) was $218.9 million and $679.1 million, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014, Economic net income (controlling interest) was $156.8 million and $444.4 million, respectively, Economic earnings per share was $2.76 and $7.90, respectively, and EBITDA (controlling interest) was $218.1 million and $621.9 million, respectively. Economic net income (controlling interest), including Economic earnings per share, and EBITDA (controlling interest) are non-GAAP performance measures and are discussed in “Supplemental Performance Measures.”For the twelve months ended September 30, 2015, our assets under management decreased 1% to $593.8 billion. The decrease was primarily the result of a $35.0 billion decrease due to market changes. This decrease was partially offset by $23.2 billion from new investments and $6.5 billion from organic growth from net client cash flows.

We consider Economic net income (controlling interest) an important measure of our financial performance, as we believe it best represents our operating performance before our share of non-cash expenses relating to our acquisition of interests in our Affiliates. Economic net income (controlling interest) and Economic earnings per share are used by our management and Board of Directors as our principal performance benchmarks, including as one of the measures for aligning executive compensation with stockholder value. These measures are provided in addition to, but not as a substitute for, Net income (controlling interest) and Earnings per share (diluted), or any other GAAP measure of financial performance or liquidity.Under our Economic net income (controlling interest) definition, we add to Net income (controlling interest) our share of intangible amortization (including equity method intangible amortization) and impairments, deferred taxes related to intangible assets, and other economic items, which include non-cash imputed interest expense (principally related to the accounting for convertible securities and contingent payment arrangements) and certain Affiliate equity expenses. We add back intangible amortization and impairments attributable to acquired client relationships because these expenses do not correspond to the changes in value of these assets, which do not diminish predictably over time. The portion of deferred taxes generally attributable to intangible assets (including goodwill) is added back because we believe it is unlikely these accruals will be used to settle material tax obligations. We add back non-cash imputed interest expenses and reductions or increases in contingent payment arrangements because it better reflects our contractual interest obligations. We add back non-cash expenses relating to certain transfers of equity between Affiliate partners when these transfers have no dilutive effect to shareholders.Economic earnings per share represents Economic net income (controlling interest) divided by the average shares outstanding (adjusted diluted). In this calculation, the potential share issuance in connection with our convertible securities is measured using a “treasury stock” method. Under this method, only the net number of shares of common stock equal to the value of these securities in excess of par, if any, are deemed to be outstanding. We believe the inclusion of net shares under a treasury stock method best reflects the benefit of the increase in available capital resources (which could be used to repurchase shares of common stock) that occurs when these securities are converted and we are relieved of our debt obligation. This method does not take into account any increase or decrease in our cost of capital in an assumed conversion.The following table provides a reconciliation of Net income (controlling interest) to Economic net income (controlling interest): For the Three Months Ended September 30, For the Nine Months Ended September 30,(in millions, except per share data)2014 2015 2014 2015Net income (controlling interest)$103.2 $109.0 $279.5 $365.7Intangible amortization and impairments(1)31.3 29.9 89.3 89.8Intangible-related deferred taxes19.0 21.1 54.2 62.3Other economic items(2)3.3 0.8 21.4 (23.6)Economic net income (controlling interest)$156.8 $160.8 $444.4 $494.2Average shares outstanding (diluted)58.8 57.0 56.1 57.4Assumed issuance of junior convertible securities shares(2.1) (2.2) — (2.2)Dilutive impact of junior convertible securities shares— — 0.2 0.2Average shares outstanding (adjusted diluted)56.7 54.8 56.3 55.4Economic earnings per share$2.76 $2.93 $7.90 $8.93____________________________(1) Our reported intangible amortization includes amortization attributable to our non-controlling interests, amounts not added back to Net income (controlling interest) to measure our Economic net income (controlling interest). Further, for our equity method Affiliates, we do not separately report revenue or expenses (including intangible amortization) in our Consolidated Statements of Income. Our share of these Affiliates’ amortization is reported in Income from equity method investments. The following table summarizes the Intangible amortization and impairments shown above:20 For the Three Months Ended September 30, For the Nine Months Ended September 30,(in millions)2014 2015 2014 2015Reported Intangible amortization and impairments$28.7 $30.5 $84.2 $86.4Intangible amortization (non-controlling interests)(6.4) (9.2) (18.2) (22.7)Equity method intangible amortization9.0 8.6 23.3 26.1Total$31.3 $29.9 $89.3 $89.8 (2) During the first quarter of 2014, we settled our 2006 junior convertible securities and recognized an expense of $18.8 million ($11.6 million net of tax) upon redemption. During the first and second quarters of 2015, we adjusted our estimate of our contingent payment obligations and, accordingly, recorded a total gain attributable to the controlling interest of $44.7 million ($27.8 million net of tax). These amounts are included in Imputed interest expense and contingent payment arrangements in the Consolidated Statements of Income. EBITDA (controlling interest)As supplemental information, we also provide a non-GAAP measure referred to as EBITDA (controlling interest). EBITDA (controlling interest) represents the controlling interest’s operating performance before our share of interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. We believe that many investors use this information when comparing the financial performance of companies in the investment management industry. EBITDA, as calculated by us, may not be consistent with computations of EBITDA by other companies. This non-GAAP performance measure is provided in addition to, but not as a substitute for, Net income (controlling interest) or any other GAAP measure of financial performance or liquidity.The following table provides a reconciliation of Net income (controlling interest) to EBITDA (controlling interest): For the Three Months Ended September 30, For the Nine Months Ended September 30,(in millions)2014 2015 2014 2015Net income (controlling interest)$103.2 $109.0 $279.5 $365.7Interest expense19.0 23.6 56.7 68.2Imputed interest expense and contingent payment arrangements(1)2.8 0.3 27.6 (40.0)Income taxes60.0 54.2 163.2 189.6Depreciation and other amortization1.8 1.9 5.6 5.8Intangible amortization and impairments(2)31.3 29.9 89.3 89.8EBITDA (controlling interest)$218.1 $218.9 $621.9 $679.1___________________________(1) During the first quarter of 2014, we settled our 2006 junior convertible securities and recognized an expense of $18.8 million upon redemption.

Assets under Management The following table presents changes in our reported assets under management by distribution channel:21Statement of Changes-Quarter to Date(in billions)Institutional Mutual Fund High Net Worth TotalJune 30, 2015$366.5 $191.9 $84.3 $642.7Client cash inflows12.7 11.0 3.6 27.3Client cash outflows(15.3) (14.3) (3.2) (32.8)Net client cash flows(2.6) (3.3) 0.4 (5.5)Market changes(25.9) (12.5) (4.3) (42.7)Other(0.6) — (0.1) (0.7)September 30, 2015$337.4 $176.1 $80.3 $593.8Statement of Changes-Year to Date(in billions)Institutional Mutual Fund High Net Worth TotalDecember 31, 2014$355.6 $188.4 $76.2 $620.2Client cash inflows41.9 37.2 10.3 89.4Client cash outflows(35.5) (41.2) (8.8) (85.5)Net client cash flows6.4 (4.0) 1.5 3.9New Investments0.7 — 5.2 5.9Market changes(25.1) (8.3) (2.5) (35.9)Other(0.2) (0.0) (0.1) (0.3)September 30, 2015$337.4 $176.1 $80.3 $593.8The distribution channel analysis presented in the following table is based on average assets under management. For the Mutual Fund distribution channel, average assets under management represent an average of the daily net assets under management. For the Institutional and High Net Worth distribution channels, average assets under management reflect the billing patterns of particular client accounts. For example, assets under management for an account that bills in advance is presented in the table on the basis of beginning-of-period assets under management while an account that bills in arrears is reflected on the basis of end-of-period assets under management. Assets under management attributable to any investment in new Affiliates are included on a weighted average basis for the period from the closing date of the respective investment. We believe that this analysis more closely correlates to the billing cycle of each distribution channel and, as such, provides a more meaningful relationship to revenue.22 For the Three Months Ended September 30,   For the Nine Months Ended September 30,  (in millions, except as noted)2014 2015 % Change 2014 2015 % ChangeAverage Assets under Management (in billions)           Including equity method Affiliates           Institutional$346.9 $346.1 0 % $327.1 $355.7 9 %Mutual Fund182.2 183.3 1 % 177.0 189.9 7 %High Net Worth75.2 82.2 9 % 72.4 81.7 13 %Total$604.3 $611.6 1 % $576.5 $627.3 9 %Consolidated Affiliates           Institutional$192.4 $179.4 (7)% $186.3 $189.5 2 %Mutual Fund145.1 138.5 (5)% 140.5 146.5 4 %High Net Worth59.9 66.3 11 % 56.5 65.3 16 %Total$397.4 $384.2 (3)% $383.3 $401.3 5 %Revenue           Institutional$256.1 $236.7 (8)% $766.2 $745.1 (3)%Mutual Fund319.6 310.1 (3)% 921.5 951.3 3 %High Net Worth64.6 66.3 3 % 182.0 198.3 9 %Total$640.3 $613.1 (4)% $1,869.7 $1,894.7 1 %Net income (controlling interest)           Institutional$46.3 $52.2 13 % $131.6 $160.5 22 %Mutual Fund47.0 45.8 (3)% 121.3 169.5 40 %High Net Worth9.9 11.0 11 % 26.6 35.7 34 %Total$103.2 $109.0 6 % $279.5 $365.7 31 %EBITDA (controlling interest)(1)           Institutional$109.4 $111.3 2 % $320.9 $342.2 7 %Mutual Fund86.9 85.1 (2)% 239.9 267.5 12 %High Net Worth21.8 22.5 3 % 61.1 69.4 14 %Total$218.1 $218.9 0 % $621.9 $679.1 9 %____________________________(1) EBITDA (controlling interest) is a non-GAAP performance measure and is discussed in “Supplemental Performance Measures.”Results of OperationsAs discussed in “Our Structure and Relationship with Affiliates”, the contractual structures of our investments vary from Affiliate to Affiliate, reflecting our tailored partnership approach. When we own a controlling interest, we consolidate the Affiliate’s results. Our discussion of revenue and operating expenses relates to our consolidated Affiliates.When we own a minority interest and are required to use the equity method of accounting, we do not consolidate the operating results of these firms (including their revenue). Our share of these firms’ earnings (net of intangible amortization) is reported in Income from equity method investments.RevenueWe derive most of our revenue from asset-based and performance fees from investment management services. Asset-based fees are typically determined as a percentage fee charged on the value of a client’s assets under management. Performance fees are billed based upon investment performance, typically on an absolute basis or relative to a benchmark, primarily on our liquid and illiquid alternative and equity products.Performance fees are typically billed less frequently than asset-based fees and although performance fees inherently depend on investment performance and will vary from period to period, we anticipate performance fees will be a recurring component of our revenue.23Our revenue is generally determined by the level of our average assets under management and the composition of our assets across our distribution channels and products within our distribution channels, which realize different fee rates. Our ratio of asset-based fees to average assets under management (“ratio of average fee rates”) is calculated as asset-based fees divided by average assets under management and may change as a result of new investments, client cash flows, market changes or changes in contractual fees. Therefore, changes in this ratio should not necessarily be viewed as an indicator of changes in contractual fee rates billed by our Affiliates to their clients.Our revenue decreased $27.2 million or 4% in the three months ended September 30, 2015. This decrease was the result of a $61.3 million or 10% decrease in asset-based fees at Affiliates included in both periods (“existing Affiliates”) related to a 9% decline in average assets under management and a decline in our ratio of average fee rates which reduced asset-based fees by $56.2 million and $5.1 million, respectively. The decline in our ratio of average fee rates was due to changes in the composition of our assets under management across our distribution channels, primarily from decreases in assets under management in the Institutional and Mutual Fund distribution channels which realize comparatively higher fee rates, partially offset by increases in assets under management in the High Net Worth distribution channel which realize comparatively lower fee rates. These decreases in revenue were partially offset by an increase in asset-based fees of $31.3 million or 5% due primarily to a 6% increase in average assets under management from the full-year impact of our 2014 investments and 2015 investments in new Affiliates.  Our revenue increased $25.0 million or 1% in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This increase was the result of a $121.5 million or 7% increase in asset-based fees due primarily to an 8% increase in average assets under management from the full-year impact of our 2014 investments and 2015 investments in new Affiliates. This increase in revenue was partially offset by an $84.0 million or 5% decrease in asset-based fees at existing Affiliates related to a 3% decline in average assets under management and a decline in our ratio of average fee rates which reduced asset-based fees by $53.5 million and $30.5 million, respectively. The decline in our ratio of average fee rates was due to changes in the composition of our assets under management across our distribution channels, primarily from decreases in assets under management in the Institutional and Mutual Fund distribution channels which realize comparatively higher fee rates, partially offset by increases in assets under management in the High Net Worth distribution channel which realize comparatively lower fee rates. The following discusses the changes in our revenue by distribution channel.Institutional Distribution ChannelOur revenue in the Institutional distribution channel decreased $19.4 million or 8%  in the three months ended September 30, 2015. This decrease was the result of a $25.2 million or 11% decrease in asset-based fees due primarily to an 11% decrease in average assets under management at existing Affiliates. These decreases in revenue were partially offset by an $8.7 million or 3% increase in asset-based fees due primarily to a 4% increase in average assets under management from the full-year impact of our 2014 investments and 2015 investments in new Affiliates.Our revenue in the Institutional distribution channel decreased $21.1 million or 3% in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This decrease was primarily the result of a $39.8 million or 6% decrease in asset-based fees at existing Affiliates related to a 4% decline in average assets under management and a decline in our ratio of average fee rates which reduced asset-based fees by $26.4 million and $13.4 million, respectively. The decline in our ratio of average fee rates was due to changes in the composition of our assets under management within the distribution channel, primarily from decreases in assets under management in products which realize comparatively higher fee rates, partially offset by increases in assets under management in products which realize comparatively lower fee rates. These decreases in revenue were partially offset by an increase in asset-based fees of $35.6 million or 5% due primarily to a 5% increase in average assets under management from the full-year impact of our 2014 investments and 2015 investments in new Affiliates. Mutual Fund Distribution ChannelOur revenue in the Mutual Fund distribution channel decreased $9.5 million or 3% in the three months ended September 30, 2015. This decrease was primarily the result of a decrease in asset-based fees of $34.3 million or 11% due primarily to an 11% decline in average assets under management at existing Affiliates. This decrease in revenue was partially offset by an increase in asset-based fees of $19.2 million or 6% due primarily to a 7% increase in average assets under management from the full-year impact of our 2014 investments in new Affiliates and an increase in performance and other fees of $5.6 million or 2%. Our revenue in the Mutual Fund distribution channel increased $29.8 million or 3% in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This increase was the result of an increase in asset-based fees of $73.2 million or 8% primarily from a 10% increase in average assets under management from the full-year impact of our 2014 investments in new Affiliates. These increases in revenue were partially offset by a decrease in asset-based fees of $48.7 million or 5% primarily due to a 5% decline in average assets under management at existing Affiliates.24High Net Worth Distribution ChannelOur revenue in the High Net Worth distribution channel increased $1.7 million or 3% in the three months ended September 30, 2015. This increase was the result of an increase in asset-based fees of $5.0 million or 8% primarily from an 8% increase in average assets under management from our 2015 investments in new Affiliates and a 2% increase in average assets under management at existing Affiliates. These increases in revenue were partially offset by a decline in asset-based fees of $3.3 million or 5% due primarily to a decline in our ratio of average fee rates at existing Affiliates. The decline in our ratio of average fee rates was due to changes in the composition of our assets under management within the distribution channel primarily from decreases in assets under management in products which realize comparatively higher fee rates, partially offset by increases in assets under management in products which realize comparatively lower fee rates.Our revenue in the High Net Worth distribution channel increased $16.3 million or 9% in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This increase was the result of an increase in asset-based fees of $22.7 million or 13% primarily due to a 10% increase in average assets under management from the full-year impact of our 2014 investments and 2015 investments in new Affiliates and a 6% increase in average assets under management at existing Affiliates. These increases in revenue were partially offset by a decrease in asset-based fees of $5.6 million or 3% primarily due to a decline in our ratio of average fee rates at existing Affiliates. The decline in our ratio of average fee rates was due to changes in the composition of our assets under management within the distribution channel primarily from decreases in assets under management in products which realize comparatively higher fee rates, partially offset by increases in assets under management in products which realize comparatively lower fee rates. In the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2015, the increase in asset-based fees in the High Net Worth distribution channel from increases in average assets under management were not directly correlated to the increase in average assets under management because the new Affiliates had lower fee rates than the ratio of average fee rates for existing Affiliates.Operating ExpensesThe following table summarizes our consolidated operating expenses: For the Three Months Ended September 30,   For the Nine Months Ended September 30,   % Change % Change(in millions)2014 2015  2014 2015 Compensation and related expenses$258.1 $243.7 (6)% $766.5 $788.7 3 %Selling, general and administrative114.4 107.5 (6)% 359.5 330.5 (8)%Intangible amortization and impairments28.7 30.5 6 % 84.2 86.4 3 %Depreciation and other amortization4.5 4.5 — % 12.3 13.5 10 %Other operating expenses10.4 11.7 13 % 30.6 33.8 10 %Total operating expenses$416.1 $397.9 (4)% $1,253.1 $1,252.9 (0)%A substantial portion of our Compensation and related, Selling, general and administrative and Other operating expenses were incurred by our Affiliates and therefore, attributable to the non-controlling interest. The majority of these expenses were incurred by Affiliates with revenue sharing arrangements through the Operating Allocation. Compensation and related expenses decreased $14.4 million or 6% in the three months ended September 30, 2015, primarily as a result of a $27.9 million decrease in compensation expense at existing Affiliates. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in compensation expense from our 2014 and 2015 investments in new Affiliates of $16.0 million. These changes primarily relate to the non-controlling interests. Compensation and related expenses increased $22.2 million or 3% in the nine months ended September 30, 2015, primarily as a result of an increase in compensation expense from our 2014 and 2015 investments in new Affiliates of $46.9 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in compensation expense at existing Affiliates of $28.3 million. These changes primarily relate to the non-controlling interests. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $6.9 million or 6% in the three months ended September 30, 2015, primarily from a decrease in sub-advisory and distribution expenses of $11.8 million at existing Affiliates in the Mutual Fund distribution channel. This decrease was partially offset by increases from our 2014 and 2015 investments in new Affiliates of $5.4 million. 25 Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $29.0 million or 8% in the nine months ended September 30, 2015, primarily from decreases in sub-advisory and distribution expenses of $40.0 million at our Affiliates in the Mutual Fund distribution channel and a $3.3 million decrease in acquisition-related professional fees. These decreases were partially offset by increases from our 2014 and 2015 investments in new Affiliates of $18.3 million. Income from Equity Method InvestmentsWhen we own a minority interest and are required to use the equity method of accounting, we only recognize our share of these Affiliates’ earnings net of intangible amortization. Accordingly, we have not consolidated these Affiliates’ operating results (including their revenue). The following table summarizes our share of the profits from our equity method investments: For the Three Months Ended September 30,   For the Nine Months Ended September 30,  (in millions)2014 2015 % Change 2014 2015 % ChangeEquity method earnings$57.4 $66.5 16 % $172.6 $197.3 14%Equity method intangible amortization9.0 8.6 (4)% 23.3 26.1 12%Income from equity method investments$48.4 $57.9 20 % $149.3 $171.2 15%Equity method earnings increased $9.1 million or 16% in the three months ended September 30, 2015, primarily as a result of our additional investment in an existing Affiliate, which increased asset-based fees (without increasing average assets under management). This increase was also the result of an increase in average assets under management at our existing Affiliates, which increased asset-based fees as well as an increase in performance fees. Equity method intangible amortization decreased $0.4 million or 4% in the three months ended September 30, 2015, as a result of a decrease due to certain assets being fully amortized.Equity method earnings increased $24.7 million or 14% in the nine months ended September 30, 2015, primarily as a result of our 2014 investments in new and existing Affiliates, which increased asset-based fees (without increasing average assets under management). This increase was also the result of an increase in average assets under management at our existing Affiliates, which increased asset-based fees as well as an increase in performance fees. Equity method intangible amortization increased $2.8 million or 12% in the nine months ended September 30, 2015, primarily as a result of a $9.5 million increase in amortization from our 2014 investments in new and additional investment in existing Affiliates, partially offset by a $6.7 million decrease due to certain assets being fully amortized. Other Non-Operating (Income) and ExpensesThe following table summarizes Other non-operating (income) and expenses: For the Three Months Ended September 30,   For the Nine Months Ended September 30,  (in millions)2014 2015 % Change 2014 2015 % ChangeInvestment and other (income) expense$(2.6) $0.1 N.M.(1) $(19.2) $(16.6) (14)%Interest expense19.0 23.6 24 % 56.7 68.2 20 %Imputed interest expense and contingent payment arrangements2.8 0.3 (89)% 27.6 (40.0) N.M.(1)Income taxes63.5 56.8 (11)% 173.4 198.5 14 %____________________________(1) Percentage change is not meaningful.Investment and other (income) expense decreased $2.7 million and $2.6 million or 14% in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively, principally as a result of decreases in the fair value of investments of $2.6 million and $11.2 million, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, these decreases were partially offset by $8.7 million of realized gains on the sale of available-for-sale securities.Interest expense increased $4.6 million or 24% and $11.5 million or 20% in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively, primarily as a result of the issuance of our senior notes in February 2015, which increased interest expense by $3.2 million and $8.0 million, respectively, and from an increase in revolver borrowing costs of $1.4 26million and $2.3 million, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, interest expense also increased by $2.1 million as a result of the issuance of our senior notes in February 2014. Imputed interest expense and contingent payment arrangements decreased $2.5 million or 89% in the three months ended September 30, 2015. This decrease was primarily a result of a $1.6 million decrease in accretion associated with contingent payment arrangements. Imputed interest expense and contingent payment arrangements decreased $67.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This decrease was primarily a result of a $44.7 million gain on the revaluation of contingent payment arrangements in the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and an $18.8 million decrease in imputed interest expense from the settlement of our 2006 junior convertible securities in the nine months ended September 30, 2014. Income tax expense decreased $6.7 million or 11% in the three months ended September 30, 2015, principally from a decrease in the effective tax rate attributable to controlling interest of 3.6%. This decrease was from the 2014 restructuring of certain non-U.S. entities and an indefinite reinvestment of non-U.S. earnings of $6.3 million.Income tax expense increased $25.1 million or 14% in the nine months ended September 30, 2015, principally from an increase in Income before taxes attributable to controlling interest. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in the effective tax rate attributable to controlling interest of 2.8%, primarily from the 2014 restructuring of certain non-U.S. entities and an indefinite reinvestment of non-U.S. earnings of $18.8 million.Net Income The previously discussed changes in revenue, expenses and Income from equity method investments had the following effect on Net income: For the Three Months Ended September 30,   For the Nine Months Ended September 30,  (in millions)2014 2015 % Change 2014 2015 % ChangeNet income$189.9 $192.3 1 % $527.4 $602.9 14 %Net income (non-controlling interests)86.7 83.3 (4)% 247.9 237.2 (4)%Net income (controlling interest)103.2 109.0 6 % 279.5 365.7 31 %Liquidity and Capital ResourcesDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we met our cash requirements primarily through cash generated by operating activities and the proceeds from the issuance of the 2025 senior notes. Our principal uses of cash were to repurchase shares of our common stock, make distributions to Affiliate partners and repay borrowings under our credit facilities. We expect that our principal uses of cash for the foreseeable future will be for investments in new and existing Affiliates, distributions to Affiliate partners, share repurchases, payment of principal and interest on outstanding debt and general working capital purposes. We anticipate that cash flows from operations, together with borrowings under our revolver and proceeds from any forward equity transactions, will be sufficient to support our cash flow needs for the foreseeable future. Cash and cash equivalents were $550.6 million and $541.7 million at December 31, 2014 and September 30, 2015, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we did not provide for U.S. federal and state income taxes on $18.8 million of undistributed earnings of our foreign entities. Such earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested outside the United States. The following summarizes our cash flow activity for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 and 2015.  For the Nine Months Ended September 30,(in millions)2014 2015Operating cash flow$1,030.4 $856.2Investing cash flow(551.0) (62.4)Financing cash flow(385.5) (794.9)27Operating Cash FlowThe decrease in cash flows from operations in the nine months ended September 30, 2015 resulted principally from a $245.9 million increase in settlements of payables, accrued liabilities and other liabilities, partially offset by an increase in net income.Investing Cash FlowNet cash flow used in investing activities decreased $488.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2015, primarily due to a decrease in investments in Affiliates of $484.4 million.Financing Cash FlowNet cash flow used in financing activities increased $409.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2015, primarily as a result of a $327.9 million increase in repurchases of common stock and a $218.6 million decrease in net borrowings of senior debt in the nine months ended September 30, 2015, partially offset by a $131.4 million decrease in distributions to non-controlling interests.The following table summarizes certain key financial data relating to our outstanding indebtedness:(in millions)December 31, 2014 September 30, 2015Senior bank debt$855.0 $410.0Senior notes736.8 1,084.5Convertible securities303.1 304.7Senior Bank DebtOn September 22, 2015, we entered into a $1.3 billion senior unsecured multicurrency revolving credit facility (the “revolver”) and a $350.0 million senior unsecured term loan facility (the “term loan” and, together with the revolver, the “credit facilities”). See Note 5 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.A portion of the proceeds from the credit facilities was used to refinance our previous $1.25 billion senior unsecured revolving facility and $250.0 million senior unsecured term loan and for the redemption of a portion of our 5.25% senior unsecured notes due 2022 (the “2022 senior notes”). The remainder may be used for general corporate purposes, including investments in new and existing Affiliates and share repurchases.We are currently rated A3 by Moody’s rating agency and BBB+ by Standard & Poor’s rating agency. A downgrade of our credit rating would have no significant financial effect on any of our agreements, securities or otherwise trigger a default.Senior NotesOn February 13, 2015, we issued $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.50% senior unsecured notes due 2025. On October 22, 2015, we redeemed, canceled and retired all $140.0 million principal amount outstanding of our 5.25% senior unsecured notes due 2022. See Note 5 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.Forward EquityUnder a forward equity agreement, we had $252.8 million remaining notional amount of shares of our common stock that we may elect to sell as of September 30, 2015. Affiliate EquityMany of our agreements provide us with a conditional right to call and Affiliate partners and our officers with the conditional right to put their retained equity interests at certain intervals. In cases where we own a minority interest, we do not typically have such put and call arrangements. The purchase price of these conditional purchases is generally calculated based upon a multiple of the Affiliate’s cash flow distributions, which is intended to represent fair value. Affiliate management partners are also permitted to sell their equity interests to other individuals or entities in certain cases, subject to our approval or other restrictions.28Our current redemption value of $695.3 million for these interests has been presented as Redeemable non-controlling interests on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Although the timing and amounts of these purchases are difficult to predict, we repurchased $103.6 million of Affiliate equity during the nine months ended September 30, 2015, and expect to repurchase approximately $20 million in the three months ended December 31, 2015. In the event of a repurchase, we become the owner of the cash flow associated with the repurchased equity.CommitmentsWe have committed to co-invest in certain investment partnerships. As of September 30, 2015, these unfunded commitments totaled $74.8 million and may be called in future periods. In connection with a past acquisition agreement, we are contractually entitled to reimbursement from a prior owner for $15.5 million of these commitments if they are called.We are contingently liable, upon achievement by certain Affiliates of specified financial targets, to make payments through 2019 of up to $72.1 million associated with our consolidated Affiliates and $151.0 million associated with our equity method Affiliates. In the remainder of 2015, we do not expect to make any payments associated with these contingent arrangements. Share RepurchasesOur Board of Directors has periodically authorized share repurchase programs, most recently in May 2015. In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, we repurchased 0.3 million and 1.5 million shares, respectively, at an average price per share of $198.42 and $214.53, respectively.Contractual ObligationsThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of September 30, 2015.

Please refer to Item 7A in our 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K.29Item 4.Controls and ProceduresWe carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures during the quarter covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the quarter covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective in ensuring that (i) the information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms, and (ii) such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, we recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and our management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating and implementing possible controls and procedures. Our disclosure controls and procedures were designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their stated objectives, and our principal executive officer and principal financial officers concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. We review on an ongoing basis and document our disclosure controls and procedures, and our internal control over financial reporting, and we may from time to time make changes in an effort to enhance their effectiveness and ensure that our systems evolve with our business.No change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) occurred during the quarter covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.30PART II—OTHER INFORMATIONItem 2.Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
