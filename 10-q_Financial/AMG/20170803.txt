Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016.These factors (among others) could affect our financial performance and cause actual results to differ materially from historical earnings and those presently anticipated and projected. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we will not undertake and we specifically disclaim any obligation to release publicly the result of any revisions that may be made to any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements or to reflect the occurrence of events, whether or not anticipated. In that respect, we caution readers not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements.Management’s Discussion and Analysis should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.Executive OverviewWe are a global active asset management company with equity investments in leading boutique investment management firms, which we refer to as our “Affiliates.” Our innovative partnership approach allows each Affiliate’s management team to own significant equity in their firm and maintain operational autonomy. Our strategy is to generate shareholder value through the growth of existing Affiliates, as well as through investments in new Affiliates and additional investments in existing Affiliates. In addition, we provide centralized assistance to our Affiliates in strategic matters, marketing, distribution, product development and operations. As of June 30, 2017, our aggregate assets under management were $772.1 billion, in more than 550 investment products across a broad range of active, return-oriented strategies.We hold meaningful equity interests in each of our Affiliates. In certain cases, we consolidate the Affiliate’s financial results in our Revenue, Operating expenses and Other non-operating (income) and expenses. In other cases, we use the equity method of accounting and our share of the Affiliate’s financial results is reported (net of intangible amortization) in Income from equity method investments. Our Affiliates accounted for under the equity method are integral to our operations and, therefore, Income from equity method investments is included in our Operating income.While we account for a majority of our Affiliates on a consolidated basis of accounting, a growing number of our Affiliates are accounted for on an equity method basis. As a result, equity method Affiliates represent a growing proportion of our Operating income, as compared to our consolidated Affiliates, which represent a decreasing proportion of our Operating income.Whether we account for an Affiliate on a consolidated or equity method basis of accounting, we generally maintain the same partnership approach and provide support and assistance in substantially the same manner, and our operating model is generally the same. Furthermore, our Affiliates are impacted by similar marketplace factors and operational trends, which may not be observable when analyzing the financial results of consolidated and equity method Affiliates separately. Therefore, we believe our aggregate operating measures of assets under management, average assets under management and aggregate revenue, which incorporate the assets under management and revenues of all of our Affiliates, regardless of the accounting treatment, have become increasingly important in providing management and investors with a more comprehensive view of the operating performance and material trends across our entire business. Aggregate revenue is calculated by combining the Revenue of our consolidated Affiliates with equity method revenue. We discuss both Revenue at our consolidated Affiliates and equity method revenue in our Results of Operations. The following table presents our key operating performance measures:22  As of and for the Three Months Ended June 30,   As of and for the Six Months Ended June 30,  (in billions, except as noted) 2016 2017 % Change 2016 2017 % ChangeAssets under management(1)            Consolidated Affiliate assets under management $368.9 $407.2 10% $368.9 $407.2 10%Equity method Affiliate assets under management 278.7 364.9 31% 278.7 364.9 31%Total  $647.6 $772.1 19% $647.6 $772.1 19%             Average assets under management(1)            Consolidated Affiliate average assets under management $373.5 $401.4 7% $368.7 $394.2 7%Equity method Affiliate average assets under management 272.8 363.0 33% 267.7 360.3 35%Total  $646.3 $764.4 18% $636.4 $754.5 19%             Revenue (in millions) $554.1 $570.9 3% $1,099.5 $1,115.2 1%Equity method revenue (in millions)(2) 443.3 653.5 47% 894.0 1,473.2 65%__________________________(1) Assets under management is presented on a current basis without regard to the timing of the inclusion of an Affiliate’s financial results in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Average assets under management provides a more meaningful relationship to our financial and operating results as it reflects both the particular billing patterns of Affiliate sponsored products and client accounts and corresponds with the timing of the inclusion of an Affiliate's financial results in our Consolidated Financial Statements.(2) Equity method revenue primarily consists of asset based and performance fees earned by our equity method Affiliates. Assets Under ManagementThrough our Affiliates, we manage active return-oriented strategies rather than passive or indexing strategies, exchange-traded funds, fixed income or money market products, which typically carry lower fee rates. We continue to see meaningful client demand for active return-oriented strategies, particularly in alternative and multi-asset strategies, reflecting continued investor demand for returns that are less correlated to traditional equity and fixed income markets. Investor demand for passively managed and indexing strategies has continued, particularly for the large cap U.S. equity portion of client portfolios, and we have experienced outflows in U.S. equity strategies consistent with this industry-wide trend. We expect client demand for alternative and multi-asset strategies to continue, and believe the best-performing active equity managers (whether global-, regional- or country-specific) will continue to have significant opportunities to grow from net client cash inflows. We believe we are well positioned to benefit from these trends.The following charts and tables provide information regarding the composition of and changes in our assets under management on a current basis by active return-oriented strategy and client type:23Assets under Management (in billions) at June 30, 2017By Strategy By Client Type__________________(1) Alternatives primarily include assets under management in long and short public equity, control equity, managed futures, multi-strategy, and other alternative and hedge fund strategies, as well as energy and infrastructure investments and primary and secondary private equity strategies. Alternative strategies generate earnings from (i) management fees from products subject to lock-ups or similar restrictions, (ii) management fees from products not subject to such restrictions and/or (iii) performance fees and carried interest.(2) Global equities include emerging markets strategies, which accounted for 10% of our overall assets under management as of June 30, 2017.By Strategy - Quarter to Date(in billions)Alternatives Global Equities U.S. Equities Multi-asset & Other TotalMarch 31, 2017$290.6 $252.6 $110.9 $99.4 $753.5 Client cash inflows and commitments14.3 10.0 3.4 4.5 32.2 Client cash outflows and realizations(9.6) (9.8) (6.6) (4.4) (30.4) Net client cash flows4.7 0.2 (3.2) 0.1 1.8 Market changes(0.8) 12.7 2.9 0.8 15.6 Foreign exchange(1)1.8 2.6 0.1 0.5 5.0 Other— (0.2) — (3.6) (3.8)June 30, 2017$296.3 $267.9 $110.7 $97.2 $772.1By Client Type - Quarter to Date(in billions)Institutional Retail High Net Worth TotalMarch 31, 2017$444.8 $201.6 $107.1 $753.5Client cash inflows and commitments16.4 11.5 4.3 32.2Client cash outflows and realizations(15.0) (11.9) (3.5) (30.4)Net client cash flows1.4 (0.4) 0.8 1.8Market changes8.6 4.2 2.8 15.6Foreign exchange(1)2.9 1.8 0.3 5.0Other(0.3) (0.1) (3.4) (3.8)June 30, 2017$457.4 $207.1 $107.6 $772.124By Strategy - Year to Date(in billions)Alternatives Global Equities U.S. Equities Multi-asset & Other TotalDecember 31, 2016$252.4 $233.9 $110.1 $92.3 $688.7 Client cash inflows and commitments26.5 17.8 6.8 9.0 60.1 Client cash outflows and realizations(17.6) (18.6) (14.6) (8.7) (59.5) Net client cash flows8.9 (0.8) (7.8) 0.3 0.6 New investments30.6 1.5 — 3.3 35.4 Market changes2.7 30.1 8.3 4.2 45.3 Foreign exchange(1)2.7 3.7 0.1 0.7 7.2 Other(1.0) (0.5) — (3.6) (5.1)June 30, 2017$296.3 $267.9 $110.7 $97.2 $772.1By Client Type - Year to Date(in billions)Institutional Retail High Net Worth TotalDecember 31, 2016$401.2 $188.3 $99.2 $688.7Client cash inflows and commitments27.9 23.8 8.4 60.1Client cash outflows and realizations(30.4) (22.1) (7.0) (59.5)Net client cash flows(2.5) 1.7 1.4 0.6New Investments31.0 1.2 3.2 35.4Market changes24.8 13.5 7.0 45.3Foreign exchange(1)4.3 2.5 0.4 7.2Other(1.4) (0.1) (3.6) (5.1)June 30, 2017$457.4 $207.1 $107.6 $772.1_________________________(1) Foreign exchange reflects the impact of translating non-U.S. dollar denominated assets under management into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes.In addition to assets under management, we also report average assets under management. Average assets under management provides a more meaningful relationship to our financial and operating results as it reflects both the particular billing patterns of Affiliate sponsored products and client accounts and corresponds with the timing of the inclusion of an Affiliate’s financial results in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Average assets under management increased $118.1 billion or 18% for the three months ended June 30, 2017 due to a 33% increase in average assets under management at equity method Affiliates and a 7% increase in average assets under management at consolidated Affiliates. Average assets under management increased $118.1 billion or 19% for the six months ended June 30, 2017 due to a 35% increase in average assets under management at equity method Affiliates and a 7% increase in average assets under management at consolidated Affiliates. Aggregate RevenueAggregate revenue is calculated by combining the Revenue of our consolidated Affiliates with equity method revenue. We derive most of our aggregate revenue from asset based revenue and performance fees from investment management services. Asset based revenue includes advisory and other fees earned by our Affiliates for services provided to their clients and are typically determined as a percentage of the value of a client’s assets under management. Performance fees are billed based upon investment performance, typically on an absolute basis or relative to a benchmark. Our ratio of asset based revenue to average assets under management (“asset based revenue ratio”) either in the aggregate, or separately for consolidated Affiliates or equity method Affiliates is calculated as asset based revenue divided by average 25assets under management for the respective Affiliates. Our asset based revenue ratios may change as a result of new investments, client cash flows, market changes, foreign exchange or changes in contractual fees.The following table presents the Revenue of our consolidated Affiliates and equity method revenue, and when combined, Aggregate revenue:  For the Three Months Ended June 30,   For the Six Months Ended June 30,  (in millions) 2016 2017 % Change 2016 2017 % ChangeRevenue $554.1 $570.9 3% $1,099.5 $1,115.2 1%Equity method revenue (1) 443.3 653.5 47% 894.0 1,473.2 65%__________________________(1) Equity method revenue primarily consists of asset based and performance fees earned by our equity method Affiliates. Aggregate revenue increased 23% in the three months ended June 30, 2017. This increase was primarily due to a $210.2 million or 47% increase in equity method revenue and a $16.8 million or 3% increase in Revenue at our consolidated Affiliates. The increase in equity method revenue was primarily due to an increase of $173.0 million or 39% from asset based revenue and an increase of $37.2 million or 8% from performance fees. The increase in asset based revenue was primarily due to a 33% increase in average assets under management and an increase in our asset based revenue ratio of 6% as a result of our 2016 investments in new equity method Affiliates which had higher asset based revenue ratios than existing Affiliates. The increase in Revenue at our consolidated Affiliates was primarily due to an increase of $22.4 million or 4% from asset based revenue, partially offset by a $5.6 million or 1% decrease from performance fees. The increase in asset based revenue at consolidated Affiliates was primarily due to a 7% increase in average assets under management, partially offset by a 3% decline in our asset based revenue ratio.Aggregate revenue increased 30% in the six months ended June 30, 2017, due primarily to an increase in equity method revenue of $579.2 million or 65% and a $15.7 million or 1% increase in Revenue at our consolidated Affiliates. The increase in equity method revenue was primarily due to an increase of $366.6 million or 41% from asset based revenue and an increase of $212.5 million or 24% from performance fees. The increase in asset based revenue was primarily due to a 35% increase in average assets under management and an increase in our asset based revenue ratio of 6% as a result of our 2016 investments in new equity method Affiliates which had higher asset based revenue ratios than existing Affiliates. The increase in Revenue at our consolidated Affiliates was primarily due to a $31.7 million or 3% increase from asset based revenue, partially offset by a $16.0 million or 2% decrease from performance fees. The increase in asset based revenue at our consolidated Affiliates was primarily due to a 7% increase in average assets under management, partially offset by a 4% decline in our asset based revenue ratio.Aggregate revenue and equity method revenue are provided in addition to, but not as substitutes for, Revenue. See Results of Operations for a further discussion of the changes in Revenue at our consolidated Affiliates and equity method revenue.Financial and Supplemental Financial Performance MeasuresThe following table presents our key financial and supplemental financial performance measures:  For the Three Months Ended June 30,   For the Six Months Ended June 30,  (in millions) 2016 2017 % Change 2016 2017 % ChangeNet income (controlling interest) $108.3 $126.3 17% $212.3 $248.8 17%Adjusted EBITDA (controlling interest)(1) 220.3 254.8 16% 436.1 498.6 14%Economic net income (controlling interest)(1) 167.4 188.7 13% 326.7 371.9 14%__________________________(1) Adjusted EBITDA (controlling interest) and Economic net income (controlling interest) are non-GAAP performance measures and are discussed in “Supplemental Financial Performance Measures.”We believe Adjusted EBITDA (controlling interest) is an important supplemental financial performance measure for our management and investors. Adjusted EBITDA (controlling interest) provides a comprehensive view of our share of the 26financial performance of our entire business before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, impairments and adjustments to our contingent payment obligations. Conversely, our GAAP financial performance measures, Operating income and Income before income taxes, include the non-controlling interest’s share of financial performance.Our ownership level of consolidated Affiliates is higher than our ownership level of our equity method Affiliates and, as a result, we experience a greater proportion of an increase or decrease in Revenue from our consolidated Affiliates than an increase or decrease in our equity method revenue. While our equity method revenue increased 47% in the three months ended June 30, 2017, our Revenue from consolidated Affiliates increased 3%, resulting in a $34.5 million or 16% increase in Adjusted EBITDA (controlling interest). In the six months ended June 30, 2017, our equity method revenue increased 65%, while our Revenue from consolidated Affiliates increased 1%, resulting in a $62.5 million or 14% increase in Adjusted EBITDA (controlling interest). Our Net income (controlling interest) increased $18.0 million or 17% in the three months ended June 30, 2017, which was generally consistent with the 16% increase in Adjusted EBITDA (controlling interest). In the six months ended June 30, 2017, our Net income (controlling interest) increased $36.5 million or 17%, which was greater on a percentage basis than the 14% increase in Adjusted EBITDA, primarily due to a decrease in our effective tax rate and lower relative growth in Amortization and impairments and Interest expense in the six month period ended June 30, 2017 than the comparative period. We consider Economic net income (controlling interest) to be an important measure of our financial performance, as we believe it best represents our performance after tax and before our share of non-cash expenses relating to our acquisition of interests in our Affiliates. Our Economic net income (controlling interest) increased $21.3 million or 13% in the three months ended June 30, 2017, which is less on a percentage basis than the increase in Adjusted EBITDA (controlling interest), primarily due to an increase in our cash taxes. In the six months ended June 30, 2017, our Economic net income (controlling interest) increased $45.2 million or 14%, consistent with the increase in Adjusted EBITDA (controlling interest).Results of OperationsThe following discussion includes the financial results of our consolidated and equity method Affiliates. Our consolidated Affiliates’ financial results are included in our Revenue, Operating expenses and Other non-operating (income) and expenses, and our share of our equity method Affiliates’ financial results is reported (net of intangible amortization) in Income from equity method investments in Operating income. RevenueThe following table summarizes our consolidated Affiliate average assets under management and Revenue:  For the Three Months Ended June 30,   For the Six Months Ended June 30,  (in millions, except as noted)2016 2017 % Change 2016 2017 % ChangeConsolidated Affiliates average assets under management (in billions)$373.5 $401.4 7% $368.7 $394.2 7%Revenue$554.1 $570.9 3% $1,099.5 $1,115.2 1%Our Revenue increased $16.8 million or 3% in the three months ended June 30, 2017, primarily due to a $22.4 million or 4% increase from asset based revenue, partially offset by a $5.6 million or 1% decrease from performance fees. The change in asset based revenue was primarily due to a 7% increase in average assets under management, partially offset by a 3% decline in our asset based revenue ratio. The decline in our asset based revenue ratio was primarily due to changes in the composition of our average assets under management. Our Revenue increased $15.7 million or 1% in the six months ended June 30, 2017, primarily due to a $31.7 million or 3% increase from asset based revenue, partially offset by a $16.0 million or 2% decrease from performance fees. The change in asset based revenue was primarily due to a 7% increase in average assets under management and a 4% decline in our asset based revenue ratio. The decline in our asset based revenue ratio was due to a decrease in asset based revenue related to renewal commissions at one of our Affiliates in the United Kingdom as a result of a regulatory change which was offset by a reduction in distribution expenses at the Affiliate which were reported in Selling, general and administrative expenses. The decline in our asset based revenue ratio was also due to changes in the composition of our average assets under management.Operating ExpensesThe following table summarizes our consolidated operating expenses:27 For the Three Months Ended June 30,   For the Six Months Ended June 30,   % Change % Change(in millions)2016 2017  2016 2017 Compensation and related expenses$232.1 $242.2 4 % $458.7 $484.2 6%Selling, general and administrative96.6 89.1 (8)% 192.5 177.8 (8)%Intangible amortization and impairments28.6 22.0 (23)% 55.3 43.9 (21)%Depreciation and other amortization5.0 4.9 (2)% 10.0 10.1 1 %Other operating expenses (net)10.0 11.8 18 % 22.5 21.7 (4)%Total operating expenses$372.3 $370.0 (1)% $739.0 $737.7 (0 )%Our operating expenses are primarily attributable to the non-controlling interests because the substantial majority of these expenses are incurred by consolidated Affiliates through which we share in revenue without regard to expenses. For these Affiliates, the amount of their operating expenses, including compensation, is generally determined by the percentage of revenue allocated to operating expenses (“Operating Allocation”) as part of the structured partnership interests in place at the respective Affiliate. Accordingly, our operating expenses are impacted by increases or decreases in an Affiliate’s revenue and corresponding increases or decreases in its respective Operating Allocation.Compensation and related expenses increased $10.1 million or 4% in the three months ended June 30, 2017, primarily due to a $6.3 million or 3% increase from compensation expenses at Affiliates and a $4.6 million or 2% increase from compensation expenses associated with Affiliate equity transactions. These changes primarily relate to the non-controlling interests.Compensation and related expenses increased $25.5 million or 6% in the six months ended June 30, 2017, primarily due to a $15.3 million or 3% increase from compensation expenses associated with Affiliate equity transactions and a $9.0 million or 2% increase from compensation expenses at Affiliates. These changes primarily relate to the non-controlling interests.Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $7.5 million or 8% in the three months ended June 30, 2017, primarily due to a $5.8 million or 6% decrease from a reduction of expenses in wealth management initiatives.Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $14.7 million or 8% in the six months ended June 30, 2017, primarily due to a $7.2 million or 4% decrease from a reduction in distribution expenses, related to commissions at certain of our Affiliates in the United Kingdom, a $5.8 million or 3% decrease from a reduction of expenses in wealth management initiatives and a $1.2 million or 1% decrease from acquisition-related professional fees. Intangible amortization and impairments decreased $6.6 million or 23% in the three months ended June 30, 2017, due to a $5.0 million or 17% decrease from a change in the pattern of economic benefit for certain assets and a $1.6 million or 6% decrease from certain assets being fully amortized.Intangible amortization and impairments decreased $11.4 million or 21% in the six months ended June 30, 2017, due to a $8.4 million or 15% decrease from a change in the pattern of economic benefit for certain assets and a $3.0 million or 6% decrease from certain assets being fully amortized.There were no significant changes in Depreciation and other amortization and Other operating expenses (net) in the three and six months ended June 30, 2017.Income from Equity Method InvestmentsFor equity method Affiliates, our share of an Affiliate’s earnings or losses is contractually calculated using a formula whereby our share is based either on a fixed percentage of such Affiliate’s revenue without regard to expenses or by reference to such Affiliate’s revenue less certain agreed-upon expenses. Our share of an Affiliate’s earnings or losses is reported (net of intangible amortization attributable to our investment in an equity method Affiliate) in Income from equity method investments in Operating income. Additional investments in existing or new Affiliates will generally impact our financial results in the year of investment and, depending upon the timing, in the following year when the full-year financial results of the Affiliate investment are reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements.The following table summarizes equity method earnings and equity method intangible amortization, which together comprise Income from equity method investments, as well as equity method Affiliate average assets under management and equity method revenue:28 For the Three Months Ended June 30,   For the Six Months Ended June 30,  (in millions, except as noted)2016 2017 % Change 2016 2017 % ChangeEquity method earnings$80.0 $99.0 24% $162.2 $206.7 27%Equity method intangible amortization(14.8) (24.0) 62% (29.0) (45.8) 58%Income from equity method investments$65.2 $75.0 15% $133.2 $160.9 21%            Operating Measures           Equity method Affiliates average assets under management (in billions)$272.8 $363.0 33% $267.7 $360.3 35%Equity method revenue$443.3 $653.5 47% $894.0 $1,473.2 65%Our equity method revenue increased $210.2 million or 47% in the three months ended June 30 2017, due to a $173.0 million or 39% increase from asset based revenue and a $37.2 million or 8% increase from performance fees. The increase in asset based revenue was due to increases of $129.2 million or 29% from our 2016 investments in new Affiliates and $43.8 million or 10% from asset based revenue at existing Affiliates. The increase in asset based revenue at existing Affiliates was due to a 15% increase in average assets under management. The increase in performance fees was primarily due to a $38.6 million or 9% increase from our 2016 investments in new Affiliates, partially offset by a $1.4 million or less than 1% decrease from performance fees at existing Affiliates. While equity method revenue increased 47% in the three months ended June 30, 2017, equity method earnings increased $19.0 million or 24%, primarily due to our 2016 investments in new Affiliates, in which we own less of the equity interests than in our existing equity method Affiliates. Equity method intangible amortization increased $9.2 million or 62% in the three months ended June 30, 2017, due to a $4.7 million or 32% increase from our 2016 investments in new Affiliates and a $4.5 million or 30% increase from a change in the pattern of economic benefit related to certain assets at existing Affiliates.Our equity method revenue increased $579.2 million or 65% in the six months ended June 30, 2017, due to a $366.7 million or 41% increase from asset based revenue and a $212.5 million or 24% increase from performance fees. The increase in asset based revenue was primarily due to increases of $270.1 million or 30% from our 2016 investments in new Affiliates and $96.5 million or 11% from asset based revenue at existing Affiliates. The increase in asset based revenue at existing Affiliates was due to a 15% increase in average assets under management. The increase in performance fees was primarily due to a $232.6 million or 26% increase from performance fees from our 2016 investments in new Affiliates, partially offset by $20.2 million or 2% decrease in performance fees at existing Affiliates.While equity method revenue increased 65% in the six months ended June 30, 2017, equity method earnings increased $44.5 million or 27%, primarily from our 2016 investments in new Affiliates, in which we own less of the equity interests than in our existing equity method Affiliates. Equity method intangible amortization increased $16.8 million or 58% in the six months ended June 30, 2017, due to an $11.0 million or 38% increase from our 2016 investments in new Affiliates and a $5.8 million or 20% increase from a change in the pattern of economic benefit related to certain assets at existing Affiliates.Non-Operating (Income) and ExpensesThe following table summarizes non-operating income and expense data: For the Three Months Ended June 30,   For the Six Months Ended June 30,  (in millions)2016 2017 % Change 2016 2017 % ChangeInvestment and other income$(11.6) $(15.7) 35% $(15.6) $(29.2) 87%Interest expense21.9 22.4 2% 44.0 44.3 1%Imputed interest expense and contingent payment arrangements0.8 2.3 188% (1.1) 3.1 N.M.

Investment and other income increased $13.6 million or 87% in the six months ended June 30, 2017, primarily due to a $12.0 million or 77% increase from changes in the fair value of investments and a $3.8 million or 24% increase from realized gains on the sale of investment securities, partially offset by a $1.7 million 11% decrease from lower dividend income. There were no significant changes in Interest expense in the three and six months ended June 30, 2017. Imputed interest expense and contingent payment arrangements increased $1.5 million in the three months ended June 30, 2017, primarily due to a $1.4 million expense on the revaluation of a contingent payment arrangement.Imputed interest expense and contingent payment arrangements increased $4.2 million in the six months ended June 30, 2017, primarily due to a $2.8 million gain on the revaluation of a contingent payment arrangement in the six months ended June 30, 2016, which did not reoccur and a $1.4 million expense on the revaluation of a contingent payment arrangement in the six months ended June 30, 2017.Income taxes increased $10.2 million or 20% and $12.8 million or 12% in the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, respectively, primarily due to an increase in Income before income taxes attributable to the controlling interest, partially offset by stock compensation tax benefits, as well as an increase in the indefinite reinvestment of certain foreign earnings.Net Income The previously discussed changes in Revenue, expenses and Income from equity method investments had the following effect on Net income: For the Three Months Ended June 30,   For the Six Months Ended June 30,  (in millions)2016 2017 % Change 2016 2017 % ChangeNet income$183.6 $204.4 11% $357.0 $398.0 11%Net income (non-controlling interests)75.3 78.1 4% 144.7 149.2 3%Net income (controlling interest)108.3 126.3 17% 212.3 248.8 17%Supplemental Financial Performance Measures Adjusted EBITDA (controlling interest)As supplemental information, we provide a non-GAAP measure that we refer to as Adjusted EBITDA (controlling interest). Adjusted EBITDA (controlling interest) represents our earnings before our share of interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, amortization, impairments and adjustments to our contingent payment obligations. We believe that many investors use this information when assessing the financial performance of companies in the investment management industry. This non-GAAP performance measure is provided in addition to, but not as a substitute for, Net income (controlling interest) or any other GAAP measures of financial performance. The following table provides a reconciliation of Net income (controlling interest) to Adjusted EBITDA (controlling interest):30 For the Three Months Ended June 30, For the Six Months Ended June 30,(in millions)2016 2017 2016 2017Net income (controlling interest)$108.3 $126.3 $212.3 $248.8Interest expense21.9 22.4 44.0 44.3Imputed interest expense and contingent payment arrangements(1)0.8 2.3 (1.1) 3.1Income taxes50.3 60.7 105.5 118.5Depreciation and other amortization2.0 2.2 4.0 4.5Intangible amortization and impairments(2)37.0 40.9 71.4 79.4Adjusted EBITDA (controlling interest)$220.3 $254.8 $436.1 $498.6___________________________(1) In the six months ended June 30, 2016, we adjusted our estimate of a contingent payment obligation and, accordingly, recorded a gain attributable to the controlling interest of $2.8 million. For the six months ended June 30, 2017, we adjusted our estimate of a contingent payment obligation and accordingly, recorded a loss attributable to the controlling interest of $1.4 million, all of which occurred in the three months ended June 30, 2017. (2) Our reported intangible amortization includes amortization attributable to our non-controlling interests. For our equity method Affiliates, we do not separately report intangible amortization in our Consolidated Statements of Income. Our share of these Affiliates’ amortization is reported in Income from equity method investments. The following table summarizes the Intangible amortization and impairments shown above: For the Three Months Ended June 30, For the Six Months Ended June 30,(in millions)2016 2017 2016 2017Reported Intangible amortization and impairments$28.6 $22.0 $55.3 $43.9Intangible amortization (non-controlling interests)(6.4) (5.1) (12.9) (10.3)Equity method intangible amortization14.8 24.0 29.0 45.8Total$37.0 $40.9 $71.4 $79.4Economic Net Income (controlling interest) and Economic Earnings Per ShareAs supplemental information, we also provide non-GAAP performance measures that we refer to as Economic net income (controlling interest) and Economic earnings per share. We consider Economic net income (controlling interest) and Economic earnings per share to be important measures of our financial performance, as we believe they best represent our performance before our share of non-cash expenses relating to our acquisition of interests in our Affiliates, and they are, therefore, employed as our principal performance measures. Economic net income (controlling interest) and Economic earnings per share are used by our management and Board of Directors as our principal performance benchmarks, including as one of the measures for aligning executive compensation with stockholder value. These measures are provided in addition to, but not as substitutes for, other GAAP measures of financial performance, such as Net income (controlling interest) and Earnings per share (diluted).Under our Economic net income (controlling interest) definition, we add to Net income (controlling interest) our share of pre-tax intangible amortization and impairments (including the portion attributable to equity method Affiliates), deferred taxes related to intangible assets, and other economic items, which include non-cash imputed interest (principally related to the accounting for convertible securities and contingent payment arrangements) and certain Affiliate equity expenses. We add back intangible amortization and impairments attributable to acquired client relationships because these expenses do not correspond to the changes in value of these assets, which do not diminish predictably over time. The portion of deferred taxes generally attributable to intangible assets (including goodwill) is added back because we believe it is unlikely these accruals will be used to settle material tax obligations. We add back non-cash imputed interest and reductions or increases in contingent payment arrangements to better reflect our contractual interest obligations. We add back non-cash expenses relating to certain transfers of equity between Affiliate partners when these transfers have no dilutive effect to shareholders.Economic earnings per share represents Economic net income (controlling interest) divided by the Average shares outstanding (adjusted diluted). In this calculation, the potential share issuance in connection with our convertible securities is measured using a “treasury stock” method. Under this method, only the net number of shares of common stock equal to the value of these convertible securities in excess of par, if any, is deemed to be outstanding. We believe the inclusion of net shares under a treasury stock method best reflects the benefit of the increase in available capital resources (which could be used to 31repurchase shares of common stock) that occurs when these securities are converted and we are relieved of our debt obligation. This method does not take into account any increase or decrease in our cost of capital in an assumed conversion.The following table provides a reconciliation of Net income (controlling interest) to Economic net income (controlling interest): For the Three Months Ended June 30, For the Six Months Ended June 30,(in millions, except per share data)2016 2017 2015 2017Net income (controlling interest)$108.3 $126.3 $212.3 $248.8Intangible amortization and impairments(1)37.0 40.9 71.4 79.4Intangible-related deferred taxes21.3 19.1 43.4 38.9Other economic items(2)(3)0.8 2.4 (0.4) 4.8Economic net income (controlling interest)$167.4 $188.7 $326.7 $371.9Average shares outstanding (diluted)56.7 58.7 56.7 59.0Assumed issuance of junior convertible securities shares(2.2) (2.2) (2.2) (2.2)Average shares outstanding (adjusted diluted)54.5 56.5 54.5 56.8Economic earnings per share$3.07 $3.33 $5.99 $6.55____________________________(1) See note (2) to the table in “Adjusted EBITDA (controlling interest).”  (2) For the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2017, Other economic items were net of income tax expense of $0.4 million and $0.8 million, respectively. For the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2017, Other economic items were net of an income tax benefit of $0.2 million and income tax expense of $1.2 million, respectively. (3) For the six months ended June 30, 2016, we adjusted our estimate of a contingent payment obligation and, accordingly, recorded a gain attributable to the controlling interest of $2.8 million ($1.7 million net of tax). For the six months ended June 30, 2017, we adjusted our estimate of a contingent payment obligation and accordingly, recorded a loss attributable to the controlling interest of $1.4 million ($0.9 million net of tax), all of which occurred in the three months ended June 30, 2017.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesDuring the six months ended June 30, 2017, we met our cash requirements primarily through cash generated by operating activities. Our principal uses of cash during the quarter were, and for the foreseeable future are expected to be, for repayments of senior debt, distributions to Affiliate equity holders, repurchases of common stock, Affiliate equity repurchases, the payment of cash dividends on our common stock, and general working capital purposes. We also expect that a principal use of cash will be for investments in new and existing Affiliates. We anticipate that cash flows from operations, together with borrowings under our revolver and proceeds from our equity distribution program, will be sufficient to support our cash flow needs for the foreseeable future. Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2016 and June 30, 2017 were $430.8 million and $364.6 million, respectively, including $18.9 million and $23.3 million, respectively, in our wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries, which could be repatriated without accruing or paying any significant additional U.S. taxes.The following table summarizes our cash flow activities: For the Six Months Ended June 30,(in millions)2016 2017Operating cash flow$341.4 $444.0Investing cash flow(540.0) 1.0Financing cash flow(14.4) (517.2)Operating Cash Flow32In the six months ended June 30, 2017, Cash flow from operating activities increased $102.6 million, of which approximately 70% was attributable to the controlling interest. Cash flow from operating activities attributable to the controlling interest increased primarily from the receipt of cash distributions of our share of equity method earnings from our 2016 investments in new Affiliates.Investing Cash FlowNet cash flow from investing activities, which is primarily attributable to the controlling interest, increased $541.0 million in the six months ended June 30, 2017, primarily due to a decrease in Investments in Affiliates of $521.1 million and an increase in Sale of investment securities of $24.1 million.Financing Cash FlowNet cash flow used in financing activities, which is primarily attributable to the controlling interest, increased $502.8 million in the six months ended June 30, 2017. This increase was primarily due to a change in the senior debt activity from net borrowings of $255.0 million in the six months ended June 30, 2016 to net repayments of $80.0 million in the six months ended June 30, 2017, an increase in repurchases of common stock of $136.8 million, and an increase in taxes paid on shares withheld from restricted stock vesting and option exercises, included in Other financing items of $25.5 million. The following table summarizes the carrying value of our outstanding indebtedness:(in millions)December 31, 2016 June 30, 2017Senior bank debt$870.0 $790.0Senior notes945.1 945.4Convertible securities307.5 308.6Senior Bank Debt and Senior NotesWe have a $1.45 billion senior unsecured multicurrency revolving credit facility (the “revolver”) and a $385.0 million senior unsecured term loan facility (the “term loan” and, together with the revolver, the “credit facilities”). The credit facilities both mature on September 30, 2020. The credit facilities contain financial covenants with respect to leverage and interest coverage, as well as customary affirmative and negative covenants, including limitations on priority indebtedness, asset dispositions and fundamental corporate changes, and certain customary events of default. As of June 30, 2017, we were in compliance with all terms of our credit facilities and had $1.0 billion of remaining capacity under our revolver, all of which we could borrow and remain in compliance with our credit facilities. On July 12, 2017, we delivered a notice to redeem all $200.0 million principal amount outstanding of our 6.375% senior unsecured notes due 2042 at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount. We will redeem the senior unsecured notes on August 15, 2017. We are currently rated A3 by Moody’s Investors Service and we were upgraded to A- by S&P Global Ratings during the quarter. A downgrade of our credit rating, including a downgrade to below investment grade, would not trigger a default or have any other significant impact on the terms of our existing credit facilities. A reduction in our credit rating could, however, increase our borrowing costs. Additionally, a downgrade of our credit rating below investment grade in connection with a change in control would require us to make a repurchase offer on certain of our senior notes.Equity Distribution ProgramIn 2016, we entered into equity distribution and forward equity agreements with several major securities firms under which we, from time to time, may issue and sell shares of our common stock (immediately or on a forward basis) having an aggregate sales price of up to $500.0 million (the “equity distribution program”). As of June 30, 2017, no sales have occurred under the equity distribution program. Affiliate EquityMany of our Affiliate agreements provide us with a conditional right to call and Affiliate equity holders with the conditional right to put their Affiliate equity interests to us at certain intervals. For equity method Affiliates, we do not typically have such put and call arrangements. The purchase price of these conditional purchases is generally calculated based 33upon a multiple of the Affiliate’s cash flow distributions, which is intended to represent fair value. Affiliate equity holders are also permitted to sell their equity interests to other individuals or entities in certain cases, subject to our approval or other restrictions.As of June 30, 2017, our current redemption value of $730.6 million for these interests has been presented as Redeemable non-controlling interests. Although the timing and amounts of these purchases are difficult to predict, we repurchased $150.4 million of Affiliate equity during the six months ended June 30, 2017, and expect to repurchase a total of approximately $175 million in 2017. In the event of a repurchase, we would become the owner of the cash flow associated with the repurchased equity.CommitmentsWe have committed to co-invest in certain investment partnerships. As of June 30, 2017, these unfunded commitments totaled $92.1 million and may be called in future periods. In connection with a past acquisition agreement, we are contractually entitled to reimbursement from a prior owner of one of the Company’s Affiliates for $11.1 million of these commitments if they are called.As of June 30, 2017, we were contingently liable, upon achievement by certain Affiliates of specified financial targets, to make payments related to our investments in Affiliates through 2019. For our consolidated Affiliates, we were contingently liable for up to $21.7 million, and expected to make payments of $8.9 million ($1.6 million in 2017). The present value of these expected payments was $7.8 million as of June 30, 2017. For our equity method Affiliates, we were contingently liable for up to $170.0 million, and expected to make no payments.Affiliate equity interests provide holders with a conditional right to put their interests to us over time. In addition, in connection with an investment in an Affiliate accounted for under the equity method, we entered into an arrangement with a minority owner of the Affiliate that gives such owner the right to sell a portion of its ownership interest in the Affiliate to us annually beginning in 2018. The purchase price of these conditional purchases will be at fair market value on the date of the transaction.We and certain of our Affiliates operate under regulatory authorities, which require that we and they maintain minimum financial or capital requirements. Share RepurchasesOur Board of Directors authorized share repurchase programs in May 2015 and January 2017, authorizing us to repurchase up to 3.0 million and 1.9 million shares of our common stock, respectively, for a total of 4.9 million shares, which do not expire. As of June 30, 2017, we had repurchased 2.2 million shares of this total authorized amount. As of June 30, 2017, we had unsettled market share repurchases for 0.2 million shares of our common stock, which were acquired under a $32.0 million accelerated share repurchase program that was completed on July 28, 2017. Contractual ObligationsThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of June 30, 2017. Contractual debt obligations include the cash payment of fixed interest.

The Company will redeem the senior unsecured notes on August 15, 2017.(3) The controlling interest portion is $5.7 million through 2017, $22.7 million in 2018-2019, $19.7 million in 2020-2021 and $29.4 million thereafter.(4) The contingent payment obligations disclosed in the table represent our expected settlement amounts associated with our investments in new Affiliates. The maximum settlement amount through 2017 is $4.7 million, $187.0 million in 2018-2019 and none thereafter.Recent Accounting Developments See Note 2 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.Item 3.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskThere have been no material changes to our Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in the three months ended June 30, 2017. Please refer to the below as well as the additional disclosures in Item 7A of our 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Foreign Currency Exchange RiskTo illustrate the effect of possible changes in currency exchange rates, we estimate a 1% change in the pound sterling and Canadian dollar to U.S. dollar exchange rates would have resulted in changes to stockholders’ equity of approximately $13 million and $2 million, respectively, as of June 30, 2017, and annual changes to Income before income taxes of $1.2 million and $0.3 million, respectively.Item 4.Controls and ProceduresWe carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures during the quarter covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the quarter covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective in ensuring that (i) the information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms, and (ii) such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, we recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and our management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating and implementing possible controls and procedures. Our disclosure controls and procedures were designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their stated objectives, and our principal executive officer and principal financial officers concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. We review on an ongoing basis and document our disclosure controls and procedures, and our internal control over financial reporting, and we may from time to time make changes in an effort to enhance their effectiveness and ensure that our systems evolve with our business.No change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) occurred during the quarter covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.PART II—OTHER INFORMATIONItem 2.Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
