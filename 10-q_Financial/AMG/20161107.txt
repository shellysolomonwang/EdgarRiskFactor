Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.These factors (among others) could affect our financial performance and cause actual results to differ materially from historical earnings and those presently anticipated and projected. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we will not undertake and we specifically disclaim any obligation to release publicly the result of any revisions that may be made to any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements or to reflect the occurrence of events, whether or not anticipated. In that respect, we caution readers not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements.Management’s Discussion and Analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.Executive OverviewWe are a global asset management company with equity investments in leading boutique investment management firms, which we refer to as our “Affiliates.” Our innovative partnership approach allows each Affiliate’s management team to own significant equity in their firm and maintain operational autonomy. Our strategy is to generate shareholder value through the growth of existing Affiliates, as well as through investments in new and additional investments in existing Affiliates. In addition, we provide centralized assistance to our Affiliates in strategic matters, marketing, distribution, product development and operations. As of September 30, 2016, our aggregate assets under management were $672.4 billion (approximately $730 billion pro forma for a pending investment and investments that have since closed), in more than 500 investment products across a broad range of active return-oriented strategies and distribution channels. We hold meaningful equity interests in each of our Affiliates. In certain cases, we own a majority interest while in other cases we own a minority interest. In all cases, Affiliate management retains a significant equity interest in their own firm. Affiliate management equity ownership (along with our ownership) aligns our interests, enhances Affiliate management equity incentives and preserves Affiliate management’s opportunity to participate directly in the long-term future growth of their firms. Our innovative partnership approach provides Affiliate management with a degree of liquidity and financial diversification and ensures that our Affiliates maintain investment and operational autonomy in managing their businesses, as well as their unique entrepreneurial culture and independence. Given our permanent partnership approach, when we own a majority of the equity interests, we address the ongoing succession planning issues facing the Affiliate’s principal owners as they transition incentives to future generations by facilitating the transfer of equity over time to the next generation of Affiliate management. In cases in which we own a minority of the equity interests, we typically do not have an obligation to repurchase Affiliate equity interests, but may make additional investments to further facilitate Affiliate ownership transition. We completed minority investments in Systematica Investments L.P. and Baring Private Equity Asia on January 4, 2016. On July 1, 2016, we completed a minority investment in Capula Investment Management LLP and on September 30, 2016, we completed a minority investment in Partner Fund Management, L.P. Subsequent to quarter end, we completed a minority investment in Winton Capital Group Ltd. on October 4, 2016. These investments will be accounted for under the equity method of accounting and we will recognize the financial results of Capula Investment Management LLP, Partner Fund Management, L.P. and Winton Capital Group Ltd. one quarter in arrears. Following the close of these transactions, Affiliate management will continue to hold a significant portion of the equity in their respective businesses and direct their day-to-day operations. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, Net income (controlling interest) was $109.2 million and $321.1 million, respectively, compared to $107.7 million and $362.0 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, 24respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, Earnings per share (diluted) was $2.00 and $5.88, respectively, compared to $1.96 and $6.51 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, Adjusted EBITDA (controlling interest) was $219.8 million and $655.8 million, respectively, Economic net income (controlling interest) was $164.5 million and $491.0 million, respectively, and Economic earnings per share was $3.02 and $9.02, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, Adjusted EBITDA (controlling interest) was $218.9 million and $679.1 million, respectively. Economic net income (controlling interest) was $159.8 million and $491.4 million, respectively, and Economic earnings per share was $2.92 and $8.88, respectively. Adjusted EBITDA (controlling interest) and Economic net income (controlling interest), including Economic earnings per share, are non-GAAP performance measures and are discussed in “Supplemental Performance Measures.”For the twelve months ended September 30, 2016, our assets under management increased 13% to $672.4 billion. The increase was primarily the result of a $49.3 billion increase from changes in markets, a $32.6 billion increase from investments in new Affiliates and a $4.6 billion increase from net client cash flows. These increases were partially offset by a $6.5 billion decrease from changes in foreign exchange rates and a $1.4 billion decrease from other. The table below summarizes our financial highlights: As of and for the Three Months Ended September 30,   As of and for the Nine Months Ended September 30,  (in millions, except as noted and per share data)2015 2016 % Change 2015 2016 % ChangeAssets under management (at period end, in billions)$593.8 $672.4 13 % $593.8 $672.4 13 %Average assets under management (in billions)611.6 663.5 8 % 627.3 645.5 3 %Revenue613.1 544.7 (11)% 1,894.7 1,644.2 (13)%Income from equity method investments57.9 67.5 17 % 171.2 200.7 17 %Net income (controlling interest)107.7 109.2 1 % 362.0 321.1 (11)%Earnings per share (diluted)1.96 2.00 2 % 6.51 5.88 (10)%            Adjusted EBITDA (controlling interest)(1)218.9 219.8 0 % 679.1 655.8 (3)%Economic net income (controlling interest)(1)159.8 164.5 3 % 491.4 491.0 (0)%Economic earnings per share(1)2.92 3.02 3 % 8.88 9.02 2 %___________________________(1) Adjusted EBITDA (controlling interest) and Economic net income (controlling interest), including Economic earnings per share, are non-GAAP performance measures and are discussed in “Supplemental Performance Measures.”Notwithstanding the recent growth in passively managed products, we believe there is continuing client demand for active return-oriented strategies. In particular, we continue to see positive net client cash flows in alternative strategies, as we believe investors are seeking returns that are less correlated to traditional equity and fixed income markets. We expect client demand for alternative strategies to continue, and believe we are well-positioned to benefit from this trend. Most of our alternative strategies are at our equity method Affiliates. We believe many boutique investment management firms will continue to seek a permanent partner with global scale and a long track record of success. We are well positioned to execute upon investment opportunities in leading traditional and alternative firms around the world, and believe that the transaction environment remains favorable. Supplemental Performance Measures Adjusted EBITDA (controlling interest)As supplemental information, we provide a non-GAAP measure that we refer to as Adjusted EBITDA (controlling interest). Adjusted EBITDA (controlling interest) represents our operating performance before our share of interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, amortization, impairments and adjustments to our contingent payment obligations. We believe that many investors use this information when assessing the financial performance of companies in the investment management industry. This non-GAAP performance measure is provided in addition to, but not as a substitute for, other GAAP measures of 25financial performance, such as Net income (controlling interest). The title of this performance measure has been renamed from EBITDA (controlling interest) to Adjusted EBITDA (controlling interest). There has been no change in the calculation of this performance measure.The following table provides a reconciliation of Net income (controlling interest) to Adjusted EBITDA (controlling interest): For the Three Months Ended September 30, For the Nine Months Ended September 30,(in millions)2015 2016 2015 2016Net income (controlling interest)$107.7 $109.2 $362.0 $321.1Interest expense23.6 22.4 68.2 66.4Imputed interest expense and contingent payment arrangements(1)0.3 0.9 (40.0) (0.2)Income taxes55.5 51.1 193.3 157.0Depreciation and other amortization1.9 2.0 5.8 5.9Intangible amortization and impairments(2)29.9 34.2 89.8 105.6Adjusted EBITDA (controlling interest)$218.9 $219.8 $679.1 $655.8___________________________(1) For the first half of 2015, we adjusted our estimates of contingent payment obligations and, accordingly, recorded a total gain attributable to the controlling interest of $44.7 million. In the first quarter of 2016, we adjusted our estimates of contingent payment obligations and, accordingly, recorded gains attributable to the controlling interest of $2.8 million. (2) Our reported intangible amortization includes amortization attributable to the non-controlling interests that is not added back to Net income (controlling interest) to measure our Economic net income (controlling interest). For our equity method Affiliates, we do not separately report revenue or expenses (including intangible amortization) in our Consolidated Statements of Income. Our share of these Affiliates’ amortization is reported in Income from equity method investments. The following table summarizes the Intangible amortization and impairments shown above: For the Three Months Ended September 30, For the Nine Months Ended September 30,(in millions)2015 2016 2015 2016Reported Intangible amortization and impairments$30.5 $26.9 $86.4 $82.2Intangible amortization (non-controlling interests)(9.2) (6.7) (22.7) (19.6)Equity method intangible amortization8.6 14.0 26.1 43.0Total$29.9 $34.2 $89.8 $105.6Economic Net Income (controlling interest) and Economic Earnings Per ShareAs supplemental information, we also provide non-GAAP performance measures that we refer to as Economic net income (controlling interest) and Economic earnings per share. We consider Economic net income (controlling interest) and Economic earnings per share to be important measures of our financial performance, as we believe they best represent our operating performance before our share of non-cash expenses relating to our acquisition of interests in our Affiliates. Economic net income (controlling interest) and Economic earnings per share are used by our management and Board of Directors as our principal performance benchmarks, including as one of the measures for aligning executive compensation with stockholder value. These measures are provided in addition to, but not as substitutes for, other GAAP measures of financial performance, such as Net income (controlling interest) and Earnings per share (diluted).Under our Economic net income (controlling interest) definition, we add to Net income (controlling interest) our share of pre-tax intangible amortization and impairments (including the portion attributable to equity method investments in Affiliates), deferred taxes related to intangible assets, and other economic items, which include non-cash imputed interest (principally related to the accounting for convertible securities and contingent payment arrangements) and certain Affiliate equity expenses. We add back intangible amortization and impairments attributable to acquired client relationships because these expenses do not correspond to the changes in value of these assets, which do not diminish predictably over time. The portion of deferred taxes generally attributable to intangible assets (including goodwill) is added back because we believe it is unlikely these accruals will be used to settle material tax obligations. We add back non-cash imputed interest expenses and reductions or increases in contingent payment arrangements because it better reflects our contractual interest obligations. We add back non-26cash expenses relating to certain transfers of equity between Affiliate partners when these transfers have no dilutive effect to shareholders.Economic earnings per share represents Economic net income (controlling interest) divided by the average shares outstanding (adjusted diluted). In this calculation, the potential share issuance in connection with our convertible securities is measured using a “treasury stock” method. Under this method, only the net number of shares of common stock equal to the value of these securities in excess of par, if any, is deemed to be outstanding. We believe the inclusion of net shares under a treasury stock method best reflects the benefit of the increase in available capital resources (which could be used to repurchase shares of common stock) that occurs when these securities are converted and we are relieved of our debt obligation. This method does not take into account any increase or decrease in our cost of capital in an assumed conversion.The following table provides a reconciliation of Net income (controlling interest) to Economic net income (controlling interest): For the Three Months Ended September 30, For the Nine Months Ended September 30,(in millions, except per share data)2015(1) 2016 2015(1) 2016Net income (controlling interest)$107.7 $109.2 $362.0 $321.1Intangible amortization and impairments(2)29.9 34.2 89.8 105.6Intangible-related deferred taxes21.1 19.5 62.3 63.0Other economic items(3)(4)1.1 1.6 (22.7) 1.3Economic net income (controlling interest)$159.8 $164.5 $491.4 $491.0Average shares outstanding (diluted)57.0 56.6 57.4 56.6Assumed issuance of junior convertible securities shares(2.2) (2.2) (2.2) (2.2)Dilutive impact of junior convertible securities shares— — 0.2 —Average shares outstanding (adjusted diluted)54.8 54.4 55.4 54.4Economic earnings per share$2.92 $3.02 $8.88 $9.02____________________________(1) We revised our previously issued Consolidated Financial Statements. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Economic net income (controlling interest) and Economic earnings per share, as previously reported, for the three months ended September 30, 2015 were $160.8 million and $2.93, respectively. Economic net income (controlling interest) and Economic earnings per share, as previously reported, for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 were $494.2 million and $8.93, respectively. (2) See note (2) to the table in “Adjusted EBITDA (controlling interest).”  (3) For the three months ended September 30, 2015 and 2016, Other economic items were net of income taxes of $0.1 million and $0.1 million, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2016, Other economic items were net of income taxes of $15.1 million and $0.1 million, respectively. (4) For the first half of 2015, we adjusted our estimates of contingent payment obligations and, accordingly, recorded a total gain attributable to the controlling interest of $44.7 million ($27.8 million net of tax). In the first quarter of 2016, we adjusted our estimates of contingent payment obligations and, accordingly, recorded a gain attributable to the controlling interest of $2.8 million ($1.7 million net of tax). These amounts are included in Imputed interest expense and contingent payment arrangements in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

When we own a majority of the equity interests of an Affiliate, we consolidate the Affiliate’s financial results in our revenue, operating expenses and other non-operating income and expenses, and primarily use structured partnership interests in which we share in the Affiliate’s revenue without regard to expenses or less certain agreed-upon expenses. When we own a minority interest, we generally use the equity method of accounting and our share of the Affiliate’s financial results is reported (net of intangible amortization) in Income from equity method investments. For these equity method Affiliates, we either share in the Affiliate’s revenue without regard to expenses or share in the Affiliate’s revenue less certain agreed-upon expenses. Additional investments in existing or new Affiliates will generally impact our financial results in the year of investment and, depending upon the timing, in the following year when the full-year financial results of the Affiliate investment are reflected in our financial statements.RevenueWe derive most of our revenue from asset-based and performance fees from investment management services. Asset-based fees are typically determined as a percentage fee charged on the value of a client’s assets under management. Performance fees are billed based upon investment performance, typically on an absolute basis or relative to a benchmark.Performance fees are typically billed less frequently than asset-based fees and, although performance fees inherently depend on investment performance and will vary from period to period, we anticipate performance fees will be a recurring component of our revenue.Our revenue is generally determined by the level of our average assets under management and the composition of our assets across our distribution channels and active return-oriented strategies within our distribution channels, which realize different fee rates. Our ratio of asset-based fees to average assets under management (“ratio of average fee rates”) is calculated as asset-based fees divided by average assets under management and may change as a result of new investments, client cash flows, market changes, foreign exchange rate changes, or changes in contractual fees. Therefore, changes in this ratio should not necessarily be viewed as an indicator of changes in contractual fee rates billed by our Affiliates to their clients.Average assets under management reflect the particular billing patterns of products and client accounts. Therefore, we believe average assets under management more closely correlates to the billing cycle of each distribution channel and, as such, provides a more meaningful relationship to revenue. In the Mutual Fund distribution channel, average assets under management 29generally represent an average of the daily net assets under management. For the Institutional and High Net Worth distribution channels, an account that bills in advance is included in the calculation of average assets under management on the basis of beginning of period assets under management, while an account that bills in arrears is reflected on the basis of end of period assets under management. Assets under management attributable to investments in new Affiliates are generally included on a weighted average basis for the period from the closing date of the respective new investment.The following tables summarize our consolidated Affiliates’ average assets under management and revenue in total and by distribution channel. These amounts do not include average assets under management at equity method Affiliates, which are summarized separately in “Income from equity method investments”: For the Three Months Ended September 30,   For the Nine Months Ended September 30,   2015 2016 % Change 2015 2016 % ChangeAverage Assets under Management (in billions)$384.2 $378.0 (2)% $401.3 $371.9 (7)%Revenue (in millions)$613.1 $544.7 (11)% $1,894.7 $1,644.2 (13)%Our revenue decreased $68.4 million or 11% in the three months ended September 30, 2016. This decrease was primarily due to a decline in our ratio of average fee rates at existing Affiliates which reduced asset-based fees by $39.3 million or 6%, including a reduction in asset-based fees related to renewal commissions at one of our Affiliates in the United Kingdom. The reduction in asset-based fees related to renewal commissions was the result of a regulatory change and was offset by a decline in distribution expenses at the Affiliate that reduced our Selling, general and administrative expenses. The decrease in revenue was also due to a decline in average assets under management at existing Affiliates, which reduced asset-based fees $20.3 million or 3%, and a decline in performance fees and other fees at existing Affiliates of $13.0 million or 2%. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in revenue from our 2015 investments in new Affiliates of $4.2 million. The decline in our ratio of average fee rates was due to the aforementioned decline in asset-based fees related to renewal commissions, as well as changes in the composition of our assets under management across our distribution channels, primarily from decreases in assets under management in the Mutual Fund and Institutional distribution channels, which realize comparatively higher fee rates, partially offset by increases in assets under management in the High Net Worth distribution channel, which realizes comparatively lower fee rates. The decline in average assets under management at existing Affiliates was primarily the result of decreases from net client cash outflows and foreign exchange, partially offset by an increase from market changes.Our revenue decreased $250.5 million or 13% in the nine months ended September 30, 2016. This decrease was due primarily to a decline in average assets under management which reduced asset-based fees $177.8 million or 9%. The decrease in revenue was also due to a decline in our ratio of average fee rates at existing Affiliates, which reduced asset-based fees $80.1 million or 4%, including a reduction in asset-based fees related to renewal commissions at one of our Affiliates in the United Kingdom. The reduction in asset-based fees related to renewal commissions was the result of a regulatory change and was offset by a decline in distribution expenses at the Affiliate that reduced our Selling, general and administrative expenses. The decrease in revenue was also the result of a decline in performance fees and other fees at existing Affiliates of $8.6 million or 1%. These decreases were partially offset by increases in revenue from our 2015 investments in new Affiliates of $16.0 million or 1%. The decline in average assets under management and our ratio of average fee rates was due to the previously discussed changes for the three months ended September 30, 2016.The following discusses the changes in our revenue by distribution channel.Institutional Distribution Channel For the Three Months Ended September 30,   For the Nine Months Ended September 30,   2015 2016 % Change 2015 2016 % ChangeAverage Assets under Management (in billions)$179.4 $175.2 (2)% $189.5 $173.4 (8)%Revenue (in millions)$236.7 $215.0 (9)% $745.1 $662.4 (11)%Our revenue in the Institutional distribution channel decreased $21.7 million or 9% in the three months ended September 30, 2016. This decrease was due primarily to a decline in our ratio of average fee rates and a decrease in average assets under management at existing Affiliates, which reduced asset-based fees $13.2 million or 5% and $7.3 million or 3%, respectively. The decrease in revenue was also the result of a decline in performance and other fees at existing Affiliates of $2.2 million or 1%. The decline in our ratio of average fee rates was due to changes in the composition of our assets under management within the distribution channel, primarily from decreases in assets under management in products which realize comparatively higher 30fee rates, partially offset by increases in assets under management in products which realize comparatively lower fee rates. The decline in average assets under management at existing Affiliates was primarily the result of decreases from net client cash outflows and foreign exchange, partially offset by an increase from market changes. Our revenue in the Institutional distribution channel decreased $82.7 million or 11% in the nine months ended September 30, 2016. This decrease was due primarily to a decrease in average assets under management and a decline in our ratio of average fee rates at existing Affiliates, which reduced asset-based fees $68.7 million or 9%, and $17.5 million or 2%, respectively. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in fees from our 2015 investments in new Affiliates of $2.7 million. The decline in average assets under management and our ratio of average fee rates was due to the previously discussed changes for the three months ended September 30, 2016. Mutual Fund Distribution Channel For the Three Months Ended September 30,   For the Nine Months Ended September 30,   2015 2016 % Change 2015 2016 % ChangeAverage Assets under Management (in billions)$138.5 $125.3 (10)% $146.5 $123.3 (16)%Revenue (in millions)$310.1 $258.6 (17)% $951.3 $773.8 (19)%Our revenue in the Mutual Fund distribution channel decreased $51.5 million or 17% in the three months ended September 30, 2016. This decrease was due primarily to a decrease in average assets under management which reduced asset-based fees $27.9 million or 9%. The decrease in revenue was also due to a decline in our ratio of average fee rates at existing Affiliates, which reduced asset-based fees $13.0 million or 4%, including a decline in asset-based fees related to renewal commissions at one of our Affiliates in the United Kingdom. The reduction in asset-based fees related to renewal commissions was the result of a regulatory change and was offset by a decline in distribution expenses at the Affiliate that reduced our Selling, general and administrative expenses. The decrease in revenue was also the result of a decline in performance fees and other fees at existing Affiliates of $10.6 million or 3%. The decline in average assets under management at existing Affiliates was primarily the result of decreases from net client cash outflows and foreign exchange, partially offset by an increase from market changes. The decline in our ratio of average fee rates was due to the aforementioned decline in asset-based fees related to renewal commissions and changes in the composition of our assets under management within the distribution channel, primarily from decreases in assets under management in products which realize comparatively higher fee rates, partially offset by increases in assets under management in products which realize comparatively lower fee rates.Our revenue in the Mutual Fund distribution channel decreased $177.5 million or 19% in the nine months ended September 30, 2016. This decrease was due primarily to a decrease in average assets under management which reduced asset-based fees $144.5 million or 15%. The decrease in revenue was also due to a decline in our ratio of average fee rates, which reduced asset-based fees $23.8 million or 3%, including a decline in asset-based fees related to renewal commissions at one of our Affiliates in the United Kingdom. The reduction in asset-based fees related to renewal commissions was the result of a regulatory change and was offset by a decline in distribution expenses at the Affiliate that reduced our Selling, general and administrative expenses. The decrease in revenue was also the result of a decline in performance and other fees at existing Affiliates of $9.4 million or 1%. The decline in average assets under management and our ratio of average fee rates was due to the previously discussed changes for the three months ended September 30, 2016.High Net Worth Distribution Channel For the Three Months Ended September 30,   For the Nine Months Ended September 30,   2015 2016 % Change 2015 2016 % ChangeAverage Assets under Management (in billions)$66.3 $77.5 17% $65.3 $75.2 15%Revenue (in millions)$66.3 $71.1 7% $198.3 $208.0 5%Our revenue in the High Net Worth distribution channel increased $4.8 million or 7% in the three months ended September 30, 2016. This increase was primarily the result of an increase in average assets under management at existing Affiliates, which increased asset-based fees $5.4 million or 8%. The increase was also the result of an increase in fees from our 2015 investments in new Affiliates of $3.4 million or 5%. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in asset-based fees of $3.8 million or 6% due to a decrease in our ratio of average fee rates at existing Affiliates. The decline in our ratio of average fee rates was due to our 2015 investments in new Affiliates, which had comparatively lower fee rates than existing Affiliates. 31Our revenue in the High Net Worth distribution channel increased $9.7 million or 5% in the nine months ended September 30, 2016. This increase was primarily the result of an increase in fees from our 2015 investments in new Affiliates of $13.3 million or 7%. The increase was also the result of an increase in average assets under management at existing Affiliates, which increased asset-based fees $6.9 million or 4%. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in assets-based fees of $10.6 million or 5% due to a decrease in our ratio of average fee rates at existing Affiliates. The decline in our ratio of average fee rates was due to the previously discussed changes for the three months ended September 30, 2016.Operating ExpensesThe following table summarizes our consolidated operating expenses: For the Three Months Ended September 30,   For the Nine Months Ended September 30,   % Change % Change(in millions)2015 2016  2015 2016 Compensation and related expenses$243.7 $244.2 0 % $788.7 $702.9 (11)%Selling, general and administrative107.5 94.2 (12)% 330.5 286.7 (13)%Intangible amortization and impairments30.5 26.9 (12)% 86.4 82.2 (5)%Depreciation and other amortization4.5 5.0 11 % 13.5 15.0 11 %Other operating expenses (net)11.7 3.4 (71)% 33.8 25.9 (23)%Total operating expenses$397.9 $373.7 (6)% $1,252.9 $1,112.7 (11)%A substantial portion of our operating expenses was incurred by our consolidated Affiliates, the substantial majority of which was incurred by Affiliates through which we share in revenue without regard to expenses. For these Affiliates, the Affiliate’s Operating Allocation percentage generally determines its operating expenses. Accordingly, our operating expenses are impacted by increases or decreases in each Affiliate’s revenue and corresponding increases or decreases in their respective Operating Allocation.There were no significant changes in Compensation and related expenses in the three months ended September 30, 2016. Compensation and related expenses decreased $85.8 million or 11% in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, primarily as a result of decreases in compensation expenses at existing Affiliates of $74.4 million and compensation expenses associated with Affiliate equity transactions of $24.6 million. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in compensation expense from our 2015 investments in new Affiliates of $7.2 million. These changes primarily relate to the non-controlling interests.Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $13.3 million or 12% in the three months ended September 30, 2016, primarily from a decrease in sub-advisory and distribution expenses of $14.9 million in the Mutual Fund distribution channel. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $43.8 million or 13% in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, primarily from a decrease in sub-advisory and distribution expenses of $50.7 million in the Mutual Fund distribution channel. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in professional fees of $7.9 million. Other operating expenses (net) decreased $8.3 million or 71% in the three months ended September 30, 2016, primarily from net gains on Affiliates’ consolidated investment products of $6.8 million.Other operating expenses (net) decreased $7.9 million or 23% in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, primarily from net gains on Affiliates’ consolidated investment products of $6.8 million.Income from Equity Method InvestmentsWhen we own a minority interest in an Affiliate, we either share in the Affiliate’s revenue without regard to expenses or less certain agreed-upon expenses. When we share in the Affiliate’s revenue without regard to expenses, we are allocated a set percentage of revenue, with the remaining revenue available to the Affiliate to fund its operating expenses and distributions to Affiliate management. When we share in the Affiliate’s revenue less certain agreed-upon expenses, our distributions are calculated by reference to the Affiliate’s revenue net of the agreed-upon categories of expenses. For our minority investments in our Affiliates, we generally use the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method of accounting, we only recognize our share of the Affiliate’s revenue without regard to expenses or less certain agreed-upon expenses, net of equity method intangible amortization.32Our equity method Affiliates derive most of their revenue from asset-based and performance fees from investment management services. Asset-based fees are typically determined as a percentage fee charged on the value of a client’s assets under management. Performance fees are billed based upon investment performance, typically on an absolute basis or relative to a benchmark, primarily on our liquid and illiquid alternative and equity products. Performance fees are typically billed less frequently than asset-based fees and, although performance fees inherently depend on investment performance and will vary from period to period, we anticipate performance fees will be a recurring component of our Income from equity method investments.Average assets under management reflect the particular billing patterns of Affiliate products and client accounts. Therefore, we believe average assets under management more closely correlates to product and client account billing cycles and, as such, provides a more meaningful relationship to equity method earnings. Average assets under management at equity method Affiliates are calculated consistent with our average assets under management at consolidated Affiliates. Our equity method Affiliates operate primarily in the Institutional distribution channel.The following table summarizes our equity method Affiliates’ average assets under management, equity method earnings and equity method amortization: For the Three Months Ended September 30,   For the Nine Months Ended September 30,   2015 2016 % Change 2015 2016 % ChangeAverage Assets under Management (in billions)$227.4 $285.5 26% $226.0 $273.6 21%Income from equity method investments (in millions)           Equity method earnings$66.5 $81.5 23% $197.3 $243.7 24%Equity method intangible amortization8.6 14.0 63% 26.1 43.0 65%Total$57.9 $67.5 17% $171.2 $200.7 17%Equity method earnings increased $15.0 million or 23% in the three months ended September 30, 2016, primarily from an increase in earnings from our 2015 and 2016 investments in new Affiliates of $13.2 million or 20% and an increase in earnings from existing Affiliates of $6.3 million or 10%. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in performance fees of $4.5 million or 7%. Equity method intangible amortization increased $5.4 million or 63% in the three months ended September 30, 2016, primarily as a result of amortization on our 2015 and 2016 investments in new Affiliates of $4.9 million.Equity method earnings increased $46.4 million or 24% in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, primarily from an increase in earnings from our 2015 and 2016 investments in new Affiliates of $40.1 million or 20% and an increase in earnings from existing Affiliates of $6.7 million or 4%. Equity method intangible amortization increased $16.9 million or 65% in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, primarily as a result of amortization on our 2015 and 2016 investments in new Affiliates of $14.6 million, and a net increase in amortization for existing affiliates of $2.3 million.Other Non-Operating (Income) and ExpensesThe following table summarizes Other non-operating (income) and expenses: For the Three Months Ended September 30,   For the Nine Months Ended September 30,  (in millions)2015 2016 % Change 2015 2016 % ChangeInvestment and other (income) expense$0.1 $(11.0) N.M.

These increases were partially offset by decreases in dividend income of $1.5 million. There were no significant changes in Imputed interest expense and contingent payment arrangements in the three months ended September 30, 2016. Imputed interest expense and contingent payment arrangements increased $39.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016. This increase was primarily a result of a $44.7 million reduction in gains on the revaluation of contingent payment arrangements.Income tax expense decreased $6.8 million or 12% and $41.1 million or 20% in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, principally from a decrease in Income before income taxes attributable to the controlling interest. Net Income The previously discussed changes in revenue, expenses and Income from equity method investments had the following effect on Net income: For the Three Months Ended September 30,   For the Nine Months Ended September 30,  (in millions)2015 2016 % Change 2015 2016 % ChangeNet income$191.0 $174.9 (8)% $599.2 $531.6 (11)%Net income (non-controlling interests)83.3 65.7 (21)% 237.2 210.5 (11)%Net income (controlling interest)107.7 109.2 1 % 362.0 321.1 (11)%Liquidity and Capital ResourcesDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we met our cash requirements primarily through cash generated by operating activities, net borrowings under our credit facilities and the settlement of a portion of a forward equity agreement. Our principal uses of cash were to make investments in new Affiliates, make distributions to Affiliate equity holders and general working capital purposes. We expect that our principal uses of cash for the foreseeable future will be for investments in new and existing Affiliates, distributions to Affiliate equity holders, payment of principal and interest on outstanding debt, share repurchases and general working capital purposes. We anticipate that cash flows from operations, together with borrowings under our revolver and proceeds from any forward equity agreements, will be sufficient to support our cash flow needs for the foreseeable future.Cash and cash equivalents were $563.8 million and $422.0 million at December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2016, respectively, including $98.6 million and $23.5 million, respectively, in our wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries. If we repatriated foreign cash and cash equivalents from our wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries, we do not anticipate that we would need to accrue or pay any significant additional U.S. taxes.The following summarizes our cash flow activities: For the Nine Months Ended September 30,(in millions)2015 2016Operating cash flow$856.2 $683.1Investing cash flow(62.4) (868.7)Financing cash flow(794.9) 38.0Operating Cash Flow34The decrease in cash flows from operations in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 of $173.1 million resulted principally from a $67.6 million decrease in Net income, a $61.5 million increase in settlements of Payables, accrued liabilities and other liabilities, primarily due to decreases in compensation accruals and a $35.9 million decrease in net Distributions received from equity method investments. Investing Cash FlowNet cash flow used in investing activities increased $806.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, primarily due to an increase in Investments in Affiliates of $834.9 million and Sale of investment securities.Financing Cash FlowNet cash flow from financing activities increased $832.9 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, due to a $346.2 million decrease in Repurchases of common stock, a $327.7 million decrease in net repayments of senior debt, a $109.2 million increase in Issuances of common stock, and a $66.8 million decrease in Distributions to non-controlling interests. The following table summarizes certain key financial data relating to our outstanding indebtedness:(in millions)December 31, 2015 September 30, 2016Senior bank debt$643.3 $873.5Senior notes937.1 938.8Convertible securities299.0 301.0Senior Bank DebtWe have a senior unsecured multicurrency revolving credit facility (the “revolver”) and a senior unsecured term loan facility (the “term loan” and, together with the revolver, the “credit facilities”). In June 2016, we amended the revolver to increase commitments from $1.3 billion to $1.45 billion, and amended the term loan to increase borrowings from $350.0 million to $385.0 million. Subject to certain conditions, we may further increase the commitments under the revolver by up to $350.0 million and borrow up to an additional $65.0 million under the term loan. The credit facilities both mature on September 30, 2020. The credit facilities contain financial covenants with respect to leverage and interest coverage, as well as customary affirmative and negative covenants, including limitations on priority indebtedness, asset dispositions and fundamental corporate changes, and certain customary events of default. As of September 30, 2016, we were in compliance with all terms of our credit facilities. As of September 30, 2016, we had approximately $960 million of remaining capacity under our revolver, and could borrow all such capacity and remain in compliance with our credit facilities. We are currently rated A3 by Moody’s Investors Service and BBB+ by S&P Global Ratings. A downgrade of our credit rating, including a downgrade to below investment grade, would not trigger a default or have any other significant impact on the terms of our existing credit facilities. A reduction in our credit rating could, however, increase our borrowing costs. Additionally, a downgrade of our credit rating below investment grade and a change in control would require us to make a repurchase offer on certain of our senior notes.Forward Equity and Equity Distribution ProgramIn June 2016, we entered into an agreement to sell approximately 2.9 million shares of our common stock at a price of $167.25 per share (a “forward equity agreement”). We have the option to cash, share or net share settle all or a portion of the agreement in one or more transactions until June 2017. During the quarter, we issued 0.9 million shares to settle a portion of the forward equity agreement and received proceeds of $150.3 million. As of September 30, 2016, 2.0 million shares remain unsettled. We expect to settle all or a significant amount of the remaining portion of the forward equity agreement by December 31, 2016 and assuming full physical settlement, net proceeds to us would be approximately $330 million. Separately, in June 2016, we entered into equity distribution and forward equity agreements with several major securities firms under which we, from time to time, may issue and sell shares (immediately or on a forward basis) having an aggregate sales price of up to $500.0 million. These agreements replaced our previous forward equity program. As of September 30, 2016, no sales have occurred under these agreements.Affiliate Equity35Many of our agreements provide us with a conditional right to call and Affiliate management, other owners and our officers with the conditional right to put their Affiliate equity interests to us at certain intervals. In cases where we own a minority interest in an Affiliate, we do not typically have such put and call arrangements. The purchase price of these conditional purchases is generally calculated based upon a multiple of the Affiliate’s cash flow distributions, which is intended to represent fair value. Affiliate equity holders are also permitted to sell their equity interests to other individuals or entities in certain cases, subject to our approval or other restrictions.As of September 30, 2016, our current redemption value of $778.5 million for these interests has been presented as Redeemable non-controlling interests on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Although the timing and amounts of these purchases are difficult to predict, we repurchased $44.5 million of Affiliate equity during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, and expect to repurchase approximately $75 million in 2016. In the event of a repurchase, we would become the owner of the cash flow associated with the repurchased equity.CommitmentsWe have committed to co-invest in certain investment partnerships. As of September 30, 2016, these unfunded commitments totaled $91.8 million and may be called in future periods. In connection with a past acquisition agreement, we are contractually entitled to reimbursement from a prior owner of one of the Company’s Affiliates for $14.0 million of these commitments if they are called.As of September 30, 2016, we were contingently liable, upon achievement by certain Affiliates of specified financial targets, to make payments through 2019 of up to $84.9 million associated with our consolidated Affiliates and $316.5 million associated with our equity method Affiliates. We expect to make payments of $10.3 million (none in 2016) of the $84.9 million related to our consolidated Affiliates and no payments in 2016 related to our equity method Affiliates. Affiliate equity interests provide holders with a conditional right to put their interests to us over time. In addition, in connection with an investment in an Affiliate accounted for under the equity method, we entered into an arrangement with a minority owner of the Affiliate that gives such owner the right to sell a portion of its ownership interest in the Affiliate to us annually beginning in 2018. The purchase price of these conditional purchases will be at fair market value on the date of the transaction.Share RepurchasesOur Board of Directors has periodically authorized share repurchase programs, most recently in May 2015. In the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we repurchased 0.2 million shares at an average price per share of $161.16, all of which occurred in the first three months of the period. As of September 30, 2016, 2.1 million shares remained available for repurchase under the May 2015 program, which does not expire.Contractual ObligationsThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of September 30, 2016. Contractual debt obligations include the cash payment of fixed interest.

Please refer to Item 7A in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Foreign Currency Exchange RiskTo illustrate the effect of possible changes in currency exchange rates, as of September 30, 2016, a 1% change in the pound sterling and Canadian dollar to U.S. dollar exchange rates would have resulted in changes to stockholders’ equity of approximately $4.4 million and $2.1 million, respectively, and changes to income before income taxes of $0.6 million and $0.3 million, respectively.Item 4.Controls and ProceduresWe carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures during the quarter covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the quarter covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective in ensuring that (i) the information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms, and (ii) such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, we recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and our management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating and implementing possible controls and procedures. Our disclosure controls and procedures were designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their stated objectives, and our principal executive officer and principal financial officers concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. We review on an ongoing basis and document our disclosure controls and procedures, and our internal control over financial reporting, and we may from time to time make changes in an effort to enhance their effectiveness and ensure that our systems evolve with our business.No change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) occurred during the quarter covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.Item 5.Other InformationThe Company’s Board of Directors has amended and restated the Company’s By-laws, effective as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, following the Board of Directors’ regular review of the Company’s governance and organizational documents. Among other changes, these amendments require, as to stockholder proposals and director nominations, that stockholder proponents provide (i) the full text of submitted stockholder proposals, (ii) their interests in the Company, including as to common stock and derivative positions, (iii) voting agreements, (iv) entitlements to performance-related fees, if any, and (v) other categories of information. The amendments also require that stockholder nominees complete customary director and officer questionnaires, as is required of other nominees, and disclose compensatory arrangements, voting commitments and other information, so that stockholders may have full information when making voting decisions. 37The By-law amendments further require that unless the Company consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, a state court located within the State of Delaware (or, if no such state court has jurisdiction, the federal court for the District of Delaware) shall be the sole and exclusive forum for specified types of legal actions. Covered actions include, among others, those (i) brought on behalf of the Company as a derivative action, (ii) asserting a breach of fiduciary duty, including the aiding and abetting of such a breach, (iii) asserting a claim under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, and (iv) asserting an “internal corporate claim” or claim that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. The Board of Directors considered various factors in its determination to adopt this provision, including, among others, prevailing market practices, that the Company is incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware, and statutory provisions and case law upholding and enforcing such provisions. Further, the Board of Directors considered the fact that adopting an exclusive forum would not prevent stockholders from bringing the specified claims, the importance to the Company and its stockholders of preventing resources from being unnecessarily diverted to address duplicative, costly and wasteful multi-forum litigation, and the value of facilitating consistency and predictability in litigation outcomes.The summary above is qualified in its entirety by the text of the amended and restated By-laws, which are attached as Exhibit 3.1 to this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.38PART II—OTHER INFORMATIONItem 2.Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
