Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.These factors (among others) could affect our financial performance and cause actual results to differ materially from historical earnings and those presently anticipated and projected. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we will not undertake and we specifically disclaim any obligation to release publicly the result of any revisions that may be made to any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements or to reflect the occurrence of events, whether or not anticipated. In that respect, we caution readers not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements.Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.Executive OverviewWe are a global asset management company with equity investments in leading boutique investment management firms, which we refer to as our “Affiliates.” Our innovative partnership approach allows each Affiliate’s management team to own significant equity in their firm and maintain operational autonomy. Our strategy is to generate shareholder value through the growth of our existing Affiliates, as well as through investments in new Affiliates and additional investments in our existing Affiliates. In addition, we provide centralized assistance to our Affiliates in strategic matters, marketing, distribution, product development and operations. As of March 31, 2019, our aggregate assets under management were $774.2 billion (approximately $778 billion pro forma for a pending investment), in more than 500 investment products across a broad range of active, return-oriented strategies.Under accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“GAAP”), we are required to consolidate certain of our Affiliates and use the equity method of accounting for others. Whether we consolidate an Affiliate or use the equity method of accounting, we maintain the same partnership approach and provide support and assistance in substantially the same manner for all of our Affiliates. Furthermore, all of our Affiliates are boutique investment managers and are impacted by similar marketplace factors and industry trends. Therefore, our key aggregate operating performance measures, which include the assets under management and fees of all of our Affiliates whether consolidated or accounted for under the equity method, are important in providing management with a more comprehensive view of the operating performance and material trends across our entire business. The following table presents our key operating performance measures:  As of and for the Three Months Ended March 31,  (in billions, except as noted) 2018 2019 % ChangeAssets under management $830.9 $774.2 (7)%Average assets under management 839.7 772.6 (8)%Aggregate fees (in millions)(1) 1,648.7 1,252.0 (24)%__________________________(1) Aggregate fees is provided in addition to, but not as a substitute for, Consolidated revenue or other GAAP performance measures. 24Assets under management is presented on a current basis without regard to the timing of the inclusion of an Affiliate’s results in our operating performance measures and Consolidated Financial Statements. Average assets under management provides a more meaningful relationship to our operating performance measures and financial results, as it reflects both the particular billing patterns of Affiliate sponsored investment products and client accounts and corresponds with the timing of the inclusion of an Affiliate's financial results in our operating performance measures and Consolidated Financial Statements. For certain of our equity method Affiliates, we report aggregate fees and the Affiliate’s financial results in our Consolidated Financial Statements one quarter in arrears. Assets Under ManagementThrough our Affiliates, we provide a comprehensive and diverse range of active, return-oriented strategies designed to assist institutional, retail and high net worth clients worldwide in achieving their investment objectives. We continue to see demand for active, return-oriented strategies, particularly in illiquid alternatives and multi-asset and fixed income strategies, reflecting continued investor demand for returns that are less correlated to traditional equity markets. In addition, investor demand for passively-managed products has continued, and we have experienced outflows in U.S. equity strategies, consistent with this industry-wide trend. We believe the best-performing active equity managers (whether global-, regional- or country-specific) will continue to have significant opportunities to grow from net client cash inflows. We believe we are well-positioned to benefit from these trends. The following charts present information regarding the composition of our assets under management by active, return-oriented strategy and client type as of March 31, 2019: ___________________ (1) Alternatives primarily include assets under management in liquid and illiquid alternatives strategies. Alternatives strategies generate earnings from (i) asset based fees from products subject to lock-ups or similar restrictions, (ii) asset based fees from products not subject to such restrictions and/or (iii) performance based fees and carried interest.(2) Global equities include emerging markets strategies, which accounted for 8% of our assets under management as of March 31, 2019.The following tables present changes in our assets under management by active, return-oriented strategy and client type for the three months ended March 31, 2019:25(in billions)Alternatives Global Equities U.S. Equities Multi-Asset & Fixed Income TotalDecember 31, 2018$293.5 $243.8 $97.6 $101.1 $736.0 Client cash inflows and commitments11.5 9.7 4.4 5.3 30.9 Client cash outflows(14.4) (13.1) (5.8) (5.0) (38.3) Net client cash flows(2.9) (3.4) (1.4) 0.3 (7.4) Market changes6.5 26.9 12.9 5.0 51.3 Foreign exchange(1)1.0 1.4 0.1 0.3 2.8 Realizations and distributions (net)(2.0) (0.1) — — (2.1) Other(2)(0.4) (0.7) (0.7) (4.6) (6.4)March 31, 2019$295.7 $267.9 $108.5 $102.1 $774.2(in billions)Institutional Retail High Net Worth TotalDecember 31, 2018$432.9 $195.4 $107.7 $736.0 Client cash inflows and commitments11.9 13.6 5.4 30.9 Client cash outflows(16.8) (17.2) (4.3) (38.3) Net client cash flows(4.9) (3.6) 1.1 (7.4) Market changes26.5 17.1 7.7 51.3 Foreign exchange(1)1.6 1.0 0.2 2.8 Realizations and distributions (net)(2.0) (0.1) — (2.1) Other(2)(2.3) 0.4 (4.5) (6.4)March 31, 2019$451.8 $210.2 $112.2 $774.2________________________(1) Foreign exchange reflects the impact of translating into U.S. dollars the assets under management of our Affiliates whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar.(2) Other primarily includes the assets under management attributable to Affiliate product transitions and transfers of our interests in our Affiliates. For the three months ended March 31, 2019, other primarily represents the divestment of a U.S. wealth Affiliate accounted for under the equity method.In addition to assets under management, we also report average assets under management. This measure provides a more meaningful relationship to aggregate fees as it reflects both the particular billing patterns of Affiliate sponsored investment products and client accounts and corresponds with the timing of the inclusion of an Affiliate’s financial results in our operating performance measures and Consolidated Financial Statements. Average assets under management were $772.6 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2019, a decrease of $67.1 billion or 8%, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2018. Aggregate FeesAggregate fees consists of the total asset and performance based fees earned by all of our Affiliates. Asset based fees include advisory and other fees earned by our Affiliates for services provided to their clients and are typically determined as a percentage of the value of a client’s assets under management. Performance based fees are based on investment performance, typically on an absolute basis or relative to a benchmark, and are recognized when they are earned (i.e., when they become billable to customers and are not subject to claw-back). Performance based fees are generally billed less frequently than asset based fees, and although performance based fees inherently depend on investment performance and will vary from period to period, we anticipate performance based fees will be a recurring component of our aggregate fees.Aggregate fees are generally determined by the level of our average assets under management, the composition of these assets across our active, return oriented strategies that realize different asset based fee ratios, and performance based fees. Our asset based fee ratio is calculated as asset based fees divided by average assets under management. 26Aggregate fees were $1,252.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019, a decrease of $396.7 million or 24% as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2018. The decrease in our aggregate fees was due to a $254.1 million or 15% decrease from performance based fees and a $142.6 million or 9% decrease from asset based fees. The $142.6 million decrease in asset based fees for the three months ended March 31, 2019 represented an 11% decline as compared to asset based fees for the three months ended March 31, 2018. The decrease in asset based fees was due to an 8% decrease in our average assets under management, primarily in global equity strategies and U.S. equity strategies, and a 3% decline in our asset based fee ratio principally due to a change in the composition of our average assets under management.Financial and Supplemental Financial Performance MeasuresThe following table presents our key financial and supplemental financial performance measures:  For the Three Months Ended March 31,  (in millions) 2018 2019 % ChangeNet income (loss) (controlling interest) $153.0 $(200.8) N.M.(1)Adjusted EBITDA (controlling interest)(2) 286.5 215.6 (25)%Economic net income (controlling interest)(2) 215.2 169.0 (21)%__________________________(1) Percentage change is not meaningful.(2) Adjusted EBITDA (controlling interest) and Economic net income (controlling interest) are non-GAAP performance measures and are discussed in “Supplemental Financial Performance Measures.”Adjusted EBITDA (controlling interest) is an important supplemental financial performance measure for management as it provides a comprehensive view of our share of the financial performance of our business before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, impairments and adjustments to our contingent payment arrangements. Our Adjusted EBITDA (controlling interest) decreased $70.9 million or 25% primarily due to a $396.7 million or 24% decrease in aggregate fees, particularly at certain equity method Affiliates in which we share in the Affiliate’s revenue less agreed-upon expenses. The expense bases of these Affiliates are generally less variable and, therefore, short-term declines in fees have a greater percentage impact on the Affiliate’s earnings relative to the impact on the Affiliate’s revenue. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA (controlling interest) was also due to a decline in Investment and other income attributable to the controlling interest. While Adjusted EBITDA (controlling interest) decreased $70.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019, our Net income (loss) (controlling interest) decreased $353.8 million. This decrease in Net income (loss) (controlling interest) as compared to Adjusted EBITDA (controlling interest) was primarily due to a $415.0 million expense to reduce the carrying value to fair value of a U.S. credit alternative Affiliate accounted for under the equity method. See Note 11 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. This decrease in Net income (loss) (controlling interest) was partially offset by a reduction in Income tax expense of $125.6 million. We believe Economic net income (controlling interest) is an important measure because it represents our performance before non-cash expenses relating to the acquisition of interests in Affiliates and improves comparability of performance between periods. While Adjusted EBITDA (controlling interest) decreased $70.9 million or 25% for the three months ended March 31, 2019, our Economic net income (controlling interest) decreased $46.2 million or 21%. Economic net income (controlling interest) decreased less on percentage terms than Adjusted EBITDA (controlling interest) primarily due to a decrease in Income tax expense. Results of OperationsThe following discussion includes the key performance measures and financial results of our consolidated and equity method Affiliates. Our consolidated Affiliates’ financial results are included in our Consolidated revenue, Consolidated expenses, and Investment and other income, and our share of our equity method Affiliates’ financial results is reported, net of intangible amortization and impairments, in Equity method income (loss) (net). Consolidated RevenueThe following table presents our consolidated Affiliate average assets under management and Consolidated revenue: 27 For the Three Months Ended March 31,  (in millions, except as noted)2018 2019 % ChangeConsolidated Affiliate average assets under management (in billions)$433.3 $399.0 (8)%Consolidated revenue$612.4 $543.1 (11)%Our Consolidated revenue decreased $69.3 million or 11% for the three months ended March 31, 2019, due to a $62.2 million or 10% decrease from asset based fees and a $7.1 million or 1% decrease from performance based fees. The $62.2 million decrease in asset based fees represented a 10% decline as compared to asset based fees for the three months ended March 31, 2018. The decrease in asset based fees was primarily due to an 8% decrease in consolidated Affiliate average assets under management, primarily in U.S. equity strategies and global equity strategies. The decrease in asset based fees was also due to a 3% decline in our consolidated Affiliate asset based fee ratio principally due to a change in the composition of our average assets under management. Consolidated ExpensesThe following table presents our Consolidated expenses: For the Three Months Ended March 31,   % Change(in millions)2018 2019 Compensation and related expenses$266.7 $228.2 (14)%Selling, general and administrative106.4 95.6 (10)%Intangible amortization and impairments23.2 29.6 28 %Interest expense21.6 18.2 (16)%Depreciation and other amortization5.5 5.2 (5)%Other expenses (net)12.0 11.0 (8)% Total consolidated expenses$435.4 $387.8 (11)%Our Consolidated expenses are primarily attributable to the non-controlling interests of our consolidated Affiliates in which we share in revenue without regard to expenses. For these Affiliates, the amount of expenses attributable to the non-controlling interests, including compensation, is generally determined by the percentage of revenue allocated to expenses as part of the structured partnership interests in place at the respective Affiliate. Accordingly, increases in revenue generally will increase a consolidated Affiliate’s expenses attributable to the non-controlling interest and decreases in revenue will generally decrease a consolidated Affiliate’s expenses attributable to the non-controlling interest.Compensation and related expenses decreased $38.5 million or 14% for the three months ended March 31, 2019, primarily due to a $25.3 million or 9% decrease from compensation expenses at Affiliates and an $8.5 million or 3% decrease from compensation expenses associated with Affiliate equity transactions, both primarily attributable to the non-controlling interests. The decrease in Compensation and related expenses was also due to a $5.2 million or 2% decrease from compensation expenses attributable to the controlling interest.Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $10.8 million or 10% for the three months ended March 31, 2019, primarily due to a $6.5 million or 6% decrease from sub-advisory and distribution expenses related to a decrease in consolidated Affiliate average assets under management and a $5.3 million or 5% decrease from Affiliate-related expenses. These changes were primarily attributable to the controlling interest.Intangible amortization and impairments increased $6.4 million or 28% for the three months ended March 31, 2019, primarily due to a $7.0 million or 30% increase from a change in the pattern of economic benefit for certain assets. This change was primarily attributable to the controlling interest.Interest expense decreased $3.4 million or 16% for the three months ended March 31, 2019, primarily due to a $3.5 million or 16% decrease due to our pound sterling-denominated forward foreign currency contracts. See Note 7 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. This change was attributable to the controlling interest.There were no significant changes in Depreciation and other amortization or Other expenses (net) for the three months ended March 31, 2019. 28Equity Method Income (Loss) (Net)For a majority of our equity method Affiliates, we use structured partnership interests in which we contractually share in the Affiliate’s revenue less agreed-upon expenses. We also use structured partnership interests in which we contractually share in the Affiliate’s revenue without regard to expenses. Our share of earnings or losses from equity method Affiliates, net of amortization and impairments, is included in Equity method income (loss) (net). The following table presents equity method Affiliate average assets under management and equity method revenue, as well as equity method earnings and equity method intangible amortization and impairments, which in aggregate form Equity method income (loss) (net): For the Three Months Ended March 31,  (in millions, except as noted)2018 2019 % ChangeOperating Performance Measures     Equity method Affiliate average assets under management (in billions)$406.4 $373.6 (8)%Equity method revenue$1,036.3 $708.9 (32)%      Financial Performance Measures     Equity method earnings$126.3 $80.1 (37)%Equity method intangible amortization and impairments(30.0) (438.2) N.M.(1)Equity method income (loss) (net)$96.3 $(358.1) N.M.(1)_________________________ (1) Percentage change is not meaningful.Our equity method revenue decreased $327.4 million or 32% for the three months ended March 31, 2019, due to a $247.0 million or 24% decrease from performance based fees and an $80.4 million or 8% decrease from asset based fees. The $80.4 million decrease in asset based fees represented a 13% decline as compared to asset based fees for the three months ended March 31, 2018. The decrease in asset based fees was due to an 8% decrease in equity method Affiliate average assets under management and a 5% decline in our asset based fee ratio due to a change in the composition of our average assets under management and fee rate reductions at certain Affiliate products. While equity method revenue decreased $327.4 million or 32% for the three months ended March 31, 2019, equity method earnings decreased $46.2 million or 37%. Equity method earnings decreased more than equity method revenue on a percentage basis due to decreases in revenue at certain equity method Affiliates in which we share in the Affiliate’s revenue less agreed-upon expenses. The expense bases of these Affiliates are generally less variable and, therefore, short-term declines in fees have a greater percentage impact on the Affiliate’s earnings relative to the impact on the Affiliate’s revenue. Equity method intangible amortization and impairments increased $408.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019, primarily from a $415.0 million expense to reduce the carrying value to fair value of a U.S. credit alternative Affiliate. See Note 11 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.Investment and Other IncomeThe following table presents our Investment and other income:  For the Three Months Ended March 31,  (in millions)2018 2019 % ChangeInvestment and other income$14.2 $8.0 (44)%Investment and other income decreased $6.2 million or 44% for the three months ended March 31, 2019, primarily due to a $12.1 million or 85% decrease from the valuation of Other investments, primarily attributable to the controlling interest. This decrease was partially offset by a $5.7 million or 40% increase from the valuation of and realized gains on the sale of Investments in marketable securities, primarily attributable to the non-controlling interest. Income Tax Expense (Benefit)29The following table presents our Income tax expense (benefit):  For the Three Months Ended March 31,  (in millions)2018 2019 % ChangeIncome tax expense (benefit)$63.5 $(61.8) N.M.(1)__________________________(1)  Percentage change is not meaningful.Income tax expense decreased $125.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019, primarily due to a decrease in Income before taxes (controlling interest) principally due to a $415.0 million expense to reduce the carrying value to fair value of a U.S. credit alternative Affiliate accounted for under the equity method.Net Income (Loss) The previously discussed changes in revenue and expenses had the following effect on Net income (loss): For the Three Months Ended March 31,  (in millions)2018 2019 % ChangeNet income (loss)$224.0 $(133.0) N.M.(1)Net income (non-controlling interests)71.0 67.8 (5)%Net income (loss) (controlling interest)153.0 (200.8) N.M.(1)__________________________(1) Percentage change is not meaningful.Supplemental Financial Performance Measures Adjusted EBITDA (controlling interest)As supplemental information, we provide a non-GAAP measure that we refer to as Adjusted EBITDA (controlling interest). Adjusted EBITDA (controlling interest) is an important supplemental financial performance measure for management as it provides a comprehensive view of our share of the financial performance of our business before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, impairments and adjustments to our contingent payment arrangements. We believe that many investors use this measure when assessing the financial performance of companies in the investment management industry. This non-GAAP performance measure is provided in addition to, but not as a substitute for, Net income (loss) (controlling interest) or other GAAP performance measures. The following table presents a reconciliation of Net income (loss) (controlling interest) to Adjusted EBITDA (controlling interest): For the Three Months Ended March 31,(in millions)2018 2019Net income (loss) (controlling interest)$153.0 $(200.8)Interest expense21.6 18.2Income taxes60.8 (64.8)Intangible amortization and impairments(1)47.6 459.8Other items(2)3.5 3.2Adjusted EBITDA (controlling interest)$286.5 $215.6___________________________(1) Our consolidated Intangible amortization and impairments includes amortization attributable to our non-controlling interests. For our equity method Affiliates, we do not separately report intangible amortization and impairments in our Consolidated Statements of Income. Our share of these Affiliates’ amortization is reported in Equity method income (loss) (net). The following table presents the Intangible amortization and impairments shown above:30  For the Three Months Ended March 31,(in millions)2018 2019Consolidated intangible amortization and impairments$23.2 $29.6Consolidated intangible amortization (non-controlling interests)(5.6) (8.0)Equity method intangible amortization and impairments30.0 438.2Total$47.6 $459.8For the three months ended March 31, 2019, equity method intangible amortization and impairments includes a $415.0 million non-cash expense to reduce the carrying value to fair value of a U.S. credit alternative Affiliate accounted for under the equity method. See Note 11 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.(2) Other items include depreciation and adjustments to contingent payment arrangements.Economic Net Income (controlling interest) and Economic Earnings Per ShareAs supplemental information, we also provide non-GAAP performance measures that we refer to as Economic net income (controlling interest) and Economic earnings per share. We believe Economic net income (controlling interest) and Economic earnings per share are important measures because they represent our performance before non-cash expenses relating to the acquisition of interests in Affiliates and improve comparability of performance between periods. Economic net income (controlling interest) and Economic earnings per share are used by our management and Board of Directors as our principal performance benchmarks, including as one of the measures for aligning executive compensation with stockholder value. These non-GAAP performance measures are provided in addition to, but not as substitutes for, Net income (loss) (controlling interest) and Earnings (loss) per share (diluted) or other GAAP performance measures. We adjust Net income (loss) (controlling interest) to calculate Economic net income (controlling interest) by adding back our share of pre-tax intangible amortization and impairments attributable to intangible assets because these expenses do not correspond to the changes in the value of these assets, which do not diminish predictably over time. We also add back the deferred taxes attributable to intangible assets because we believe it is unlikely these accruals will be used to settle material tax obligations. Further, we add back other economic items to improve comparability of performance between periods.Economic earnings per share represents Economic net income (controlling interest) divided by the Average sharesoutstanding (adjusted diluted). In this calculation, the potential share issuance in connection with our junior convertible securities is measured using a “treasury stock” method. Under this method, only the net number of shares of common stock equal to the value of these junior convertible securities in excess of par, if any, is deemed to be outstanding. We believe the inclusion of net shares under a treasury stock method best reflects the benefit of the increase in available capital resources (which could be used to repurchase shares of common stock) that occurs when these securities are converted and we are relieved of our debt obligation. This method does not take into account any increase or decrease in our cost of capital in an assumed conversion.The following table presents a reconciliation of Net income (loss) (controlling interest) to Economic net income (controlling interest):31 For the Three Months Ended March 31,(in millions, except per share data)2018 2019Net income (loss) (controlling interest)$153.0 $(200.8)Intangible amortization and impairments(1)47.6 459.8Intangible-related deferred taxes(2)13.2 (93.8)Other economic items(3)1.4 3.8Economic net income (controlling interest)$215.2 $169.0Average shares outstanding (diluted)57.0 51.9Stock options and restricted stock units— 0.0Assumed issuance of junior convertible securities shares(2.2) —Average shares outstanding (adjusted diluted)54.8 51.9Economic earnings per share$3.92 $3.26____________________________(1) See note (1) to the table in “Adjusted EBITDA (controlling interest).”  (2) For the three months ended March 31, 2019, we recorded a $415.0 million non-cash expense to reduce the carrying value to fair value of a U.S. credit alternative Affiliate accounted for under the equity method, which reduced intangible-related deferred taxes by $103.8 million. (3) For the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2019, other economic items were net of income tax expense of $0.2 million in each period. Beginning with the three months ended March 31, 2019, other economic items include tax windfalls and shortfalls from share-based compensation. Prior periods have not been revised as the amounts were not significant.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesFor the three months ended March 31, 2019, we met our cash requirements through cash generated by operating activities. Our principal uses of cash during the quarter were, and for the foreseeable future are expected to be, for repurchases of common stock, distributions to Affiliate equity holders, repayments of debt, the payment of cash dividends on our common stock, repurchases of Affiliate equity interests and general working capital purposes. We also expect that principal uses of cash will be for investments in new and existing Affiliates. We anticipate that cash flows from operations, together with borrowings under our revolver, will be sufficient to support our cash flow needs for the foreseeable future. In addition, we may draw funding from the debt and equity capital markets, and our credit ratings, among other factors, allow us to access these sources of funding on favorable terms. We are currently rated A3 by Moody’s Investors Service and A- by S&P Global Ratings.Cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2018 and March 31, 2019 were $565.5 million and $305.2 million, respectively. The following table summarizes our operating, investing and financing cash flow activities: For the Three Months Ended March 31,(in millions)2018 2019Operating cash flow$205.0 $(17.9)Investing cash flow(3.9) (0.1)Financing cash flow(313.1) (243.7)Operating Cash FlowOperating cash flows decreased $222.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019, primarily due to a $129.2 million decrease in distributions received from equity method investments, which was attributable to the controlling interest. The decrease in operating cash flows was also due to a decrease in Net income as adjusted for non-cash items. Investing Cash Flow32Investing cash flows increased $3.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019, primarily due to a $6.6 million increase in net sales of investment securities and a $2.5 million decrease in the purchase of fixed assets, partially offset by a $5.3 million increase in net investments in Affiliates. Financing Cash FlowFinancing cash flows decreased $69.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019, primarily due to a $101.9 million decrease in net repurchases of our common stock, a $10.4 million decrease in note and contingent payments, and a $7.8 million decrease in distributions to non-controlling interests. These increases were partially offset by a $53.7 million, net change in debt activity (from $5.0 million of net borrowings for the three months ended March 31, 2018 to $48.7 million of net repayments for the three months ended March 31, 2019). All of these changes were attributable to the controlling interest.DebtThe following table presents the carrying value of our outstanding indebtedness:(in millions)December 31, 2018 March 31, 2019Senior bank debt$780.0 $460.0Senior notes746.2 746.4Junior convertible securities312.5 313.2Junior subordinated notes— 271.3The carrying value of long-term debt differs from the amount reported in Note 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, as the carrying value of the long-term debt in the table above is not reduced for debt issuance costs.Senior Bank DebtOn January 18, 2019, we amended and restated our existing credit facilities to provide for a $1.25 billion senior unsecured multicurrency revolving credit facility (the “revolver”) and a $450.0 million senior unsecured term loan facility (the “term loan” and, together with the revolver, the “credit facilities”). The revolver matures on January 18, 2024, and the term loan matures on January 18, 2023. Subject to certain conditions, we may increase the commitments under the revolver by up to an additional $500.0 million and may borrow up to an additional $75.0 million under the term loan. We pay interest on any outstanding obligations under the credit facilities at specified rates, based either on an applicable LIBOR or prime rate, plus a marginal rate determined based on our credit rating. For the three months ended March 31, 2019, the interest rate for substantially all of our borrowings under the credit facilities was LIBOR plus 1.10% for the revolver and LIBOR plus 0.875% for the term loan.The credit facilities contain financial covenants with respect to leverage and interest coverage, as well as customary affirmative and negative covenants, including limitations on priority indebtedness, asset dispositions and fundamental corporate changes, and certain customary events of default. As of March 31, 2019, we were in compliance with all terms of our credit facilities and had approximately $1.2 billion of remaining capacity under our revolver, all of which we could borrow and remain in compliance with our credit facilities.Junior Subordinated NotesOn March 27, 2019, we issued $280.0 million of junior subordinated notes with a maturity date of March 30, 2059. The junior subordinated notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 5.875% per annum, payable quarterly in cash, commencing on June 30, 2019, subject to our right to defer interest payments in accordance with the terms of the junior subordinated notes. The junior subordinated notes were issued at 100% of the principal amount and rank junior and subordinate in right of payment and upon liquidation to all of our current and future senior indebtedness. On or after March 30, 2024, at our option, the junior subordinated notes may be redeemed in whole or in part, at 100% of the principal amount, plus any accrued and unpaid interest. Prior to March 30, 2024, at our option, the junior subordinated notes may be redeemed in whole but not in part, at 100% of the principal amount, plus any accrued and unpaid interest, if certain changes in tax laws, regulations or interpretations occur; or at 102% of the principal amount, plus any accrued and unpaid interest, if a rating agency makes certain changes relating to the equity credit criteria for securities with features similar to the junior subordinated notesOn April 8, 2019, we issued an additional $20.0 million of junior subordinated notes pursuant to the underwriters’ exercise of an overallotment option, which increased the total amount issued to $300.0 million. 33We used a majority of the net proceeds from the junior subordinated notes offering to repay outstanding indebtedness under the revolver, with the remaining proceeds used for other general corporate purposes. Equity Distribution ProgramOn March 27, 2019, we entered into equity distribution and forward equity agreements with several major securities firms under which we may, from time to time, issue and sell shares of our common stock (immediately or on a forward basis) having an aggregate sales price of up to $500.0 million (the “equity distribution program”). This equity distribution program superseded and replaced our prior equity distribution program. As of March 31, 2019, no sales had occurred under the new or prior equity distribution program. DerivativesWe have two separate pound sterling-denominated forward foreign currency contracts (the “forward contracts”) with a large financial institution (the “counterparty”) to access lower interest rates. In order to limit our exposure to both gains and losses on the forward contracts, we concurrently entered into two separate collar contracts (the “collar contracts”) with the same counterparty for the same notional amounts and expiration dates as the forward contracts. Under one of the forward contracts, we will deliver £285.8 million for $400.0 million in 2024, and under the other forward contract, we will deliver £325.3 million for $450.0 million in 2021. Under one of the collar contracts, we sold a put option with a lower strike price of 1.288 U.S. dollars per one pound sterling and purchased a call option with an upper strike price of 1.535 U.S. dollars per one pound sterling. Under the other collar contract, we sold a put option with a lower strike price of 1.318 U.S. dollars per one pound sterling and purchased a call option with an upper strike price of 1.448 U.S. dollars per one pound sterling. The forward contracts and the collar contracts provide net settlement rights and require the parties to post collateral throughout the term of the contracts. The combination of the forward contracts and the collar contracts were designated as net investment hedges against fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on certain of our investments in Affiliates with the pound sterling as their functional currency. See Note 7 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.Affiliate EquityMany of our consolidated Affiliate agreements provide us with a conditional right to call and Affiliate equity holders with the conditional right to put their Affiliate equity interests to us at certain intervals. For equity method Affiliates, we do not typically have such put and call arrangements. The purchase price of these conditional purchases is generally calculated based upon a multiple of the Affiliate’s cash flow distributions, which is intended to represent fair value. Affiliate equity holders are also permitted to sell their equity interests to other individuals or entities in certain cases, subject to our approval or other restrictions.As of March 31, 2019, our current redemption value of $754.8 million for these interests (including $6.5 million of consolidated Affiliate sponsored investment products primarily attributable to third-party investors) has been presented as Redeemable non-controlling interests. Although the timing and amounts of these purchases are difficult to predict, we paid $15.4 million for repurchases and received $9.4 million for issuances of Affiliate equity during the three months ended March 31, 2019, and expect to repurchase a total of approximately $150 million of Affiliate equity in 2019. In the event of a repurchase, we become the owner of the cash flow associated with the repurchased equity.CommitmentsSee Note 8 of our Consolidated Financial Statements.Share RepurchasesDuring the three months ended March 31, 2019, we repurchased 0.9 million shares of our common stock at an average price per share of $106.09. As of March 31, 2019, we had 4.1 million shares remaining under our authorized share repurchase programs, which have no expiry. Contractual ObligationsThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of March 31, 2019. Contractual debt obligations include the cash payment of fixed interest.34   Payments Due(in millions)Total Remainder of 2019 2020-2021 2022-2023 ThereafterContractual Obligations         Senior bank debt$460.0 $— $— $450.0 $10.0Senior notes914.6 14.6 58.5 58.5 783.0Junior convertible securities846.8 16.6 44.4 44.4 741.4Junior subordinated notes946.4 12.5 32.9 32.9 868.1Leases(1)227.8 25.8 73.8 51.6 76.6Affiliate equity repurchase obligations75.4 75.4 — — —Total contractual obligations$3,471.0 $144.9 $209.6 $637.4 $2,479.1___________________________(1) The controlling interest portion is $10.0 million through 2019, $24.5 million in 2020-2021, $19.6 million in 2022-2023 and $15.9 million thereafter.This table does not include liabilities for commitments to co-invest in certain Affiliate sponsored investment products or uncertain tax positions of $146.6 million and $34.2 million, respectively. This table also does not include potential obligations relating to our derivative financial instruments (see Note 7 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information). These items are excluded as we cannot predict the amount or timing of when such obligations will be paid.  During the three months ended March 31, 2019, we were notified by the minority owner of a non-U.S. credit alternative Affiliate accounted for under the equity method that it had elected to sell to us a 5% ownership interest in the Affiliate. We will pay $25.7 million for the interest, and the sale is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2019. See Note 8 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.Recent Accounting Developments None.Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments Our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10‑K includes additional information about our Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments, and should be read in conjunction with this Quarterly Report on Form 10‑Q.Equity Method Investments in AffiliatesWe make judgments to determine fair value when we test our equity method investments for impairment, and use valuation techniques that include discounted cash flow analyses, where we make assumptions about growth rates of projected assets under management, client attrition, asset and performance based fees, expenses and profitability. In these analyses, we also make judgments about tax benefits, credit risk, interest rates, tax rates, discount rates and discounts for lack of marketability. We consider the reasonableness of our assumptions by comparing our valuation conclusions to observed market transactions and, in certain instances, by consulting with third-party valuation firms. Changes in these assumptions could significantly impact the respective fair value of an equity method investment in an Affiliate. We perform equity method investment impairment tests annually, or more frequently should circumstances suggest that fair value may have declined below the related carrying value. Impairments are recognized when the fair value of the Affiliate has declined below its carrying value for a period we consider other-than-temporary. If we determine that a decline in fair value below our carrying value is other-than-temporary, the expense recognized reduces the carrying value of the Affiliate to its fair value.During the three months ended March 31, 2019, the Company recognized a $415.0 million expense to reduce the carrying value to fair value of a U.S. credit alternative Affiliate accounted for under the equity method. See Note 11 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Changes in the assumptions used could significantly impact the fair value of this Affiliate.For our remaining equity method investments in Affiliates, no triggering events were identified during the three months ended March 31, 2019 that would indicate an increased risk of impairment.35Item 3.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskThere have been no material changes to our Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk for the three months ended March 31, 2019. Please refer to the below as well as the additional disclosures in Item 7A of our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Foreign Currency Exchange RiskTo illustrate the effect of possible changes in foreign currency exchange rates, we estimate a 1% change in the pound sterling and Canadian dollar to U.S. dollar exchange rates would have resulted in changes to stockholders’ equity of $3.7 million and $2.0 million, respectively, based on the March 31, 2019 carrying value of Affiliates whose functional currency is pound sterling or the Canadian dollar, and of our and our Affiliates’ pound sterling-denominated derivative financial instruments. For the three months ended March 31, 2019, we estimate a 1% change in the pound sterling and Canadian dollar to U.S. dollar exchange rates would have resulted in annual changes to Income (loss) before income taxes (controlling interest) of $1.1 million and $0.3 million, respectively.Item 4.Controls and ProceduresWe carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures during the quarter covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the quarter covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective in ensuring that (i) the information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms, and (ii) such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, we recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and our management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating and implementing possible controls and procedures. Our disclosure controls and procedures were designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their stated objectives, and our principal executive officer and principal financial officers concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. We review on an ongoing basis and document our disclosure controls and procedures, and our internal control over financial reporting, and we may from time to time make changes in an effort to enhance their effectiveness and ensure that our systems evolve with our business.No change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) occurred during the quarter covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.PART II—OTHER INFORMATIONItem 2.Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
