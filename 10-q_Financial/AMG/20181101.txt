Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.These factors (among others) could affect our financial performance and cause actual results to differ materially from historical earnings and those presently anticipated and projected. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we will not undertake and we specifically disclaim any obligation to release publicly the result of any revisions that may be made to any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements or to reflect the occurrence of events, whether or not anticipated. In that respect, we caution readers not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements.Management’s Discussion and Analysis should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.Executive OverviewWe are a global asset management company with equity investments in leading boutique investment management firms, which we refer to as our “Affiliates.” Our innovative partnership approach allows each Affiliate’s management team to own significant equity in their firm and maintain operational autonomy. Our strategy is to generate shareholder value through the growth of existing Affiliates, as well as through investments in new Affiliates and additional investments in existing Affiliates. In addition, we provide centralized assistance to our Affiliates in strategic matters, marketing, distribution, product development and operations. As of September 30, 2018, our assets under management were $829.6 billion in more than 550 investment products across a broad range of active return-oriented strategies.We hold meaningful equity interests in each of our Affiliates and maintain the same partnership approach, provide support and assistance in substantially the same manner, and our operating model is generally the same for all Affiliates. Furthermore, our Affiliates are all impacted by similar marketplace factors and operational trends. Therefore, our aggregate operating performance measures of assets under management, average assets under management and aggregate fees, which incorporate the assets under management and fees of all of our Affiliates, are important in providing management with a more comprehensive view of the operating performance and material trends across our entire business. The following table presents our key operating performance measures:  As of and for the Three Months Ended September 30,   As of and for the Nine Months Ended September 30,  (in billions, except as noted) 2017 2018 % Change 2017 2018 % ChangeAssets under management(1) $803.7 $829.6 3% $803.7 $829.6 3%Average assets under management(1) 790.6 834.1 6% 766.5 834.5 9%Aggregate fees (in millions)(2) 1,272.3 1,278.0 0% 3,860.7 4,210.7 9%__________________________(1) Assets under management is presented on a current basis without regard to the timing of the inclusion of an Affiliate’s results in our operating performance measures or Consolidated Financial Statements. Average assets under management provides a more meaningful relationship to our operating performance measures and financial results as it reflects both the particular billing patterns of Affiliates sponsored products and client accounts and corresponds with the timing of the 25inclusion of an Affiliate's financial results in our Consolidated Financial Statements. For certain of our equity method Affiliates, aggregate fees and financial results are reported one quarter in arrears. (2) Aggregate fees consists of the total asset and performance based fees earned by all of our Affiliates. Aggregate fees is an operating measure used by management to evaluate the operating performance and material trends across our entire business. Aggregate fees is provided in addition to, but not as a substitute for, our financial performance measures. Assets Under ManagementThrough our Affiliates, we manage active return-oriented strategies, rather than passively-managed products, which typically carry lower fee rates. We continue to see demand for active return-oriented strategies, particularly in alternatives and multi-asset strategies, reflecting continued investor demand for returns that are less correlated to traditional equity and fixed income markets. In addition, we see both U.S. and non-U.S. investors increasing their allocations to global equities strategies. Investor demand for passively-managed products has continued, particularly for the large cap U.S. equity portions of client portfolios, and we have experienced outflows in U.S. equity strategies consistent with this industry-wide trend. We expect client demand for alternatives and multi-asset strategies to continue, and believe the best-performing active equity managers (whether global-, regional- or country-specific) will continue to have significant opportunities to grow from net client cash inflows. We believe we are well-positioned to benefit from these trends. The following charts present information regarding the composition of our assets under management by active return-oriented strategy and client type as of September 30, 2018: _______________(1) Alternatives primarily include assets under management in fixed income/equity relative value, systematic diversified, private equity and real assets, and other alternatives strategies. Alternatives strategies generate earnings from (i) asset based fees from products subject to lock-ups or similar restrictions, (ii) asset based fees from products not subject to such restrictions and/or (iii) performance fees and carried interest.(2) Global equities include emerging markets strategies, which accounted for 8% of our assets under management as of September 30, 2018.The following tables present changes in our assets under management by active return-oriented strategy and client type for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018:26By Strategy - Quarter to Date(in billions)Alternatives Global Equities U.S. Equities Multi-asset & Other TotalJune 30, 2018$322.0 $283.3 $116.0 $102.9 $824.2 Client cash inflows and commitments17.0 10.0 4.7 4.5 36.2 Client cash outflows(12.5) (12.0) (6.4) (4.4) (35.3) Net client cash flows4.5 (2.0) (1.7) 0.1 0.9 Market changes2.3 2.1 6.3 1.1 11.8 Foreign exchange(1)(0.7) (0.3) 0.1 0.1 (0.8) Realizations and distributions (net)(2.9) (0.1) — (0.1) (3.1) Other(2)(3.3) 1.0 (1.1) — (3.4)September 30, 2018$321.9 $284.0 $119.6 $104.1 $829.6By Client Type - Quarter to Date(in billions)Institutional Retail High Net Worth TotalJune 30, 2018$477.3 $231.2 $115.7 $824.2 Client cash inflows and commitments20.8 11.4 4.0 36.2 Client cash outflows(15.1) (16.3) (3.9) (35.3) Net client cash flows5.7 (4.9) 0.1 0.9 Market changes6.4 3.4 2.0 11.8 Foreign exchange(1)(0.4) (0.6) 0.2 (0.8) Realizations and distributions (net)(3.0) — (0.1) (3.1) Other(2)(3.6) 0.5 (0.3) (3.4)September 30, 2018$482.4 $229.6 $117.6 $829.6By Strategy - Year to Date(in billions)Alternatives Global Equities U.S. Equities Multi-asset & Other TotalDecember 31, 2017$324.0 $293.4 $116.1 $102.8 $836.3 Client cash inflows and commitments44.5 33.9 14.3 13.5 106.2 Client cash outflows(31.9) (38.8) (19.3) (12.9) (102.9) Net client cash flows12.6 (4.9) (5.0) 0.6 3.3 Market changes(4.2) (0.5) 9.8 1.6 6.7 Foreign exchange(1)(1.8) (3.1) (0.2) (0.8) (5.9) Realizations and distributions (net)(6.4) (0.2) — (0.1) (6.7) Other(2)(2.3) (0.7) (1.1) — (4.1)September 30, 2018$321.9 $284.0 $119.6 $104.1 $829.627By Client Type - Year to Date(in billions)Institutional Retail High Net Worth TotalDecember 31, 2017$488.6 $232.7 $115.0 $836.3 Client cash inflows and commitments50.3 43.2 12.7 106.2 Client cash outflows(45.3) (45.2) (12.4) (102.9) Net client cash flows5.0 (2.0) 0.3 3.3 Market changes2.5 1.0 3.2 6.7 Foreign exchange(1)(3.1) (2.5) (0.3) (5.9) Realizations and distributions (net)(6.3) (0.1) (0.3) (6.7) Other(2)(4.3) 0.5 (0.3) (4.1)September 30, 2018$482.4 $229.6 $117.6 $829.6_________________________(1) Foreign exchange reflects the impact of translating into U.S. dollars the assets under management of Affiliates whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar.(2) Other primarily includes the assets under management attributable to Affiliate product transitions and transfers of ourinterests in Affiliates.In addition to assets under management, we also report average assets under management. This measure provides a more meaningful relationship to aggregate fees as it reflects both the particular billing patterns of Affiliate sponsored products and client accounts and corresponds with the timing of the inclusion of an Affiliate’s financial results in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Average assets under management were $834.1 billion and $834.5 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, respectively, an increase of $43.5 billion or 6% and $68.0 billion or 9%, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017, respectively. Aggregate Fees Aggregate fees consists of the total asset and performance based fees earned by all of our Affiliates. Asset based fees include advisory and other fees earned by our Affiliates for services provided to their clients and are typically determined as a percentage of the value of a client’s assets under management. Performance fees are based on investment performance, typically on an absolute basis or relative to a benchmark. Our ratio of asset based fees to average assets under management (“asset based fee ratio”) is calculated as asset based fees divided by average assets under management. Our asset based fee ratios may change as a result of new investments, client cash flows, market changes, foreign exchange, realizations and distributions or changes in contractual fees.Our aggregate fees are generally determined by the level of our average assets under management, the composition of these assets across our active return-oriented strategies that realize different asset based fee ratios, and performance fees. Aggregate fees were $1,278.0 million in the three months ended September 30, 2018, an increase of $5.7 million or less than 1% compared to the three months ended September 30, 2017. The increase in our aggregate fees was the result of an increase in asset based fees of $24.0 million or 2%, partially offset by a decrease in performance fees of $18.3 million or 1%. The change in asset based fees was due to a 6% increase in our average assets under management, primarily in alternatives and U.S. equities strategies, partially offset by a 3% decline in our asset based fee ratio due to a change in the composition of our average assets under management and fee rate reductions at certain Affiliate products.Aggregate fees were $4,210.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2018, an increase of $350.0 million or 9% compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2017. The increase in our aggregate fees was the result of an increase in asset based fees of $177.8 million or 5% and an increase in performance fees of $172.2 million or 4%. The change in asset based fees was due to a 9% increase in our average assets under management primarily in alternatives and global equities strategies, partially offset by a 3% decline in our asset based fee ratio due to a change in the composition of our average assets under management and fee rate reductions at certain Affiliate products.Financial and Supplemental Financial Performance Measures28The following table presents our key financial and supplemental financial performance measures:  For the Three Months Ended September 30,   For the Nine Months Ended September 30,  (in millions) 2017 2018 % Change 2017 2018 % ChangeNet income (controlling interest) $125.4 $124.9 (0 )% $374.2 $394.9 6%Adjusted EBITDA (controlling interest)(1) 256.3 237.8 (7)% 754.8 770.5 2%Economic net income (controlling interest)(1) 191.3 184.0 (4)% 563.2 594.8 6%__________________________(1) Adjusted EBITDA (controlling interest) and Economic net income (controlling interest) are non-GAAP performance measures and are discussed in “Supplemental Financial Performance Measures.”Adjusted EBITDA (controlling interest) is an important supplemental financial performance measure for management as it provides a comprehensive view of our share of the financial performance of our business before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, impairments and adjustments to our contingent payment arrangements. While our aggregate fees increased $5.7 million or less than 1% in the three months ended September 30, 2018, our Adjusted EBITDA (controlling interest) decreased $18.5 million or 7%, primarily due to a decrease in earnings at certain equity method Affiliates at which our share of earnings is contractually calculated using a formula based on a percentage of the Affiliate’s revenue less certain agreed-upon expenses. This change was also due to an increase in certain non-reoccurring Affiliate equity and compensation expenses, and a decrease in Investment and other income. While our aggregate fees increased $350.0 million or 9% in the nine months ended September 30, 2018, our Adjusted EBITDA (controlling interest) increased $15.7 million or 2%, primarily due to a decrease in earnings at certain equity method Affiliates at which our share of earnings is contractually calculated using a formula based on a percentage of the Affiliate’s revenue less certain agreed-upon expenses. This change was also due to greater growth, proportionally, in aggregate fees at our equity method Affiliates in which we own less of an economic interest and a decrease in Investment in other income.While Adjusted EBITDA (controlling interest) decreased $18.5 million or 7% in the three months ended September 30, 2018, our Net income (controlling interest) decreased $0.5 million or less than 1% due to decreases in our Interest expense and effective tax rate. In the nine months ended September 30, 2018, Adjusted EBITDA (controlling interest) increased $15.7 million or 2%, and our Net income (controlling interest) increased $20.7 million or 6%, primarily from decreases in our Interest expense and effective tax rate, partially offset by a $33.3 million expense ($25.0 million net of tax) to reduce the remaining carrying value of one of our equity method Affiliates to zero in the second quarter of 2018. We consider Economic net income (controlling interest) to be an important measure of our financial performance, as we believe it best represents our performance after tax and before our share of non-cash expenses relating to our acquisition of interests in our Affiliates. While Adjusted EBITDA (controlling interest) decreased $18.5 million or 7% in the three months ended September 30, 2018, our Economic net income controlling interest decreased $7.3 million or 4%, due to decreases in our Interest expense and effective tax rate. While Adjusted EBITDA (controlling interest) increased $15.7 million or 2% in the nine months ended September 30, 2018, our Economic net income (controlling interest) increased $31.6 million or 6%, primarily due to a decrease in our Interest expense and effective tax rate. Results of OperationsThe following discussion includes the financial results of our consolidated and equity method Affiliates. Our consolidated Affiliates’ financial results are included in our consolidated revenue, consolidated expenses, and Investment and other income, and our share of our equity method Affiliates’ financial results is reported (net of intangible amortization and impairments) in Equity method income (net). Consolidated RevenueThe following table presents our consolidated Affiliate average assets under management and consolidated revenue: 29 For the Three Months Ended September 30,   For the Nine Months Ended September 30,  (in millions, except as noted)2017 2018 % Change 2017 2018 % ChangeConsolidated Affiliate average assets under management (in billions)$414.5 $425.3 3% $400.9 $427.6 7%Consolidated revenue$585.7 $601.3 3% $1,700.9 $1,813.9 7%Our consolidated revenue increased $15.6 million or 3% in the three months ended September 30, 2018, due to a $17.8 million or 3% increase from asset based revenue, partially offset by a $2.2 million or less than 1% decrease from performance fees. The increase in asset based revenue was primarily due to a 3% increase in consolidated Affiliate average assets under management primarily in alternatives and multi-asset and other strategies. Our consolidated revenue increased $113.0 million or 7% in the nine months ended September 30, 2018, due to a $109.6 million or 6% increase from asset based revenue and a $3.4 million or less than 1% increase from performance fees. The increase in asset based revenue was primarily due to a 7% increase in consolidated Affiliate average assets under management, primarily in alternatives and global equities strategies.   Consolidated ExpensesThe following table presents our consolidated expenses: For the Three Months Ended September 30,   For the Nine Months Ended September 30,   % Change % Change(in millions)2017 2018  2017 2018 Compensation and related expenses$238.7 $253.6 6 % $722.9 $761.3 5 %Selling, general and administrative91.9 102.8 12 % 269.7 314.4 17 %Intangible amortization and impairments21.2 30.1 42 % 65.1 76.5 18 %Interest expense22.1 19.6 (11)% 67.6 62.6 (7)%Depreciation and other amortization4.8 5.3 10 % 14.9 16.5 11 %Other expenses (net)10.9 10.2 (6)% 35.9 33.4 (7)% Total consolidated expenses$389.6 $421.6 8 % $1,176.1 $1,264.7 8 %Our consolidated expenses are primarily attributable to the non-controlling interests of our consolidated Affiliates in which we share in revenue without regard to expenses. For these Affiliates, the amount of their expenses attributable to the non-controlling interests, including compensation, is generally determined by the percentage of revenue allocated to expenses as part of the structured partnership interests in place at the respective Affiliate. Accordingly, increases in revenue generally will increase a consolidated Affiliate’s expenses attributable to the non-controlling interest and decreases in revenue will generally decrease a consolidated Affiliate’s expenses attributable to the non-controlling interest.Compensation and related expenses increased $14.9 million or 6% in the three months ended September 30, 2018, due to a $10.9 million or 5% increase in compensation expenses attributable to the controlling interest, and a $4.0 million or 2% increase in compensation expenses attributable to the non-controlling interests. The increase in compensation expenses attributable to the controlling interest was primarily due to a non-reoccurring $3.7 million increase in Affiliate equity expense, a non-reoccurring $1.8 million increase in compensation expense, and a $1.6 million increase in share-based compensation expense.Compensation and related expenses increased $38.4 million or 5% in the nine months ended September 30, 2018, primarily due to a $32.8 million or 5% increase from compensation expenses attributable to the non-controlling interests due to an increase in consolidated revenue, and a $6.4 million or 1% increase from compensation expenses attributable to the controlling interest, primarily due to a $4.0 million increase in share-based compensation expense. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $10.9 million or 12% in the three months ended September 30, 2018, primarily due to a $6.4 million or 7% increase in Affiliate-related expenses and a $4.8 million or 5% increase in distribution-related expenses from our adoption of ASU 2014-09, which were offset by an increase in consolidated revenue.Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $44.7 million or 17% in the nine months ended September 30, 2018, primarily due to a $30.0 million or 11% increase in Affiliate-related expenses and a $15.5 million or 6% increase in distribution-related expenses from our adoption of ASU 2014-09, which were offset by an increase in consolidated revenue.30Intangible amortization and impairments increased $8.9 million or 42% and $11.4 million or 18% in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, respectively, due to a reduction in the expected period of economic benefit for certain assets. In the nine months ended September 30, 2018, this increase was partially offset by certain assets being fully amortized.Interest expense decreased $2.5 million or 11% and $5.0 million or 7% in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, respectively, principally due to the redemption of our 6.375% senior unsecured notes due 2042, which decreased Interest expense $1.7 million or 8% and $8.7 million or 13%, respectively. In the nine months ended September 30, 2018, this decrease was partially offset by a $3.4 million or 5% increase in revolver and term loan interest expense due to increased interest rates.There were no significant changes in Depreciation and other amortization in the three months ended September 30, 2018. Depreciation and other amortization increased $1.6 million or 11% in the nine months ended September 30, 2018, primarily due to a $2.6 million or 48% increase attributable to the controlling interest, partially offset by a $1.0 million or 12% decrease at Affiliates attributable to the non-controlling interests.There were no significant changes in Other expenses (net) in the three months ended September 30, 2018. Other expenses (net) decreased $2.5 million or 7% in the nine months ended September 30, 2018, primarily due to an increase in gains resulting from the changes in the value of Affiliate equity repurchase obligations and contingent payment arrangements attributable to the controlling interest. Equity Method Income (Net)For equity method Affiliates, we use structured partnership interests in which our share of the Affiliate’s earnings or losses is contractually calculated, allocated and distributed using a formula based on a percentage of the Affiliate’s revenue less certain agreed-upon expenses. We also use structured partnership interests in which our share of the Affiliate’s earnings or losses is contractually calculated, allocated and distributed using a formula based on a percentage of the Affiliate’s revenue without regard to expenses. Our share of earnings from equity method Affiliates, net of amortization and impairments, is included in Equity method income (net). The following table presents equity method Affiliate average assets under management and equity method revenue, as well as equity method earnings and equity method intangible amortization and impairments, which together form Equity method income (net): For the Three Months Ended September 30,   For the Nine Months Ended September 30,  (in millions, except as noted)2017 2018 % Change 2017 2018 % ChangeOperating Performance Measures           Equity method Affiliate average assets under management (in billions)$376.1 $408.8 9 % $365.6 $406.9 11 %Equity method revenue$686.6 $676.7 (1)% $2,159.8 $2,396.8 11 %            Financial Performance Measures           Equity method earnings$96.6 $81.9 (15)% $303.3 $300.3 (1)%Equity method intangible amortization and impairments(25.9) (22.2) (14)% (71.7) (109.0) 52 %Equity method income (net)$70.7 $59.7 (16)% $231.6 $191.3 (17)%Our equity method revenue decreased $9.9 million or 1% in the three months ended September 30, 2018, due to a $16.1 million or 2% decrease from performance fees, partially offset by a $6.2 million or 1% increase from asset based fees. The increase in asset based fees was due to a 9% increase in equity method Affiliate average assets under management, partially offset by a 7% decline in our asset based fee ratio due to a change in the composition of our average assets under management, including the recognition of assets under management prior to the recognition of revenue, and fee rate reductions at certain Affiliate products.While equity method revenue decreased $9.9 million or 1% in the three months ended September 30, 2018, equity method earnings decreased $14.7 million or 15%, due to a decrease in earnings at certain Affiliates at which our share of earnings is contractually calculated using a formula based on a percentage of the Affiliate’s revenue less certain agreed-upon expenses.31Equity method intangible amortization and impairments decreased $3.7 million or 14% in the three months ended September 30, 2018, primarily due to changes in the expected period of the economic benefit, partially offset by certain assets being fully amortized.Our equity method revenue increased $237.0 million or 11% in the nine months ended September 30, 2018, due to a $168.8 million or 8% increase from performance fees and a $68.2 million or 3% increase from asset based fees. The increase in asset based fees was due to an 11% increase in equity method Affiliate average assets under management, partially offset by a 7% decline in our asset based fee ratio due to a change in the composition of our average assets under management, including the recognition of assets under management prior to the recognition of revenue, and fee rate reductions at certain Affiliate products.While equity method revenue increased $237.0 million or 11% in the nine months ended September 30, 2018, equity method earnings decreased $3.0 million or 1%, due to a decrease in earnings at certain Affiliates at which our share of earnings is contractually calculated using a formula based on a percentage of the Affiliate’s revenue less certain agreed-upon expenses.Equity method intangible amortization and impairments increased $37.3 million or 52% in the nine months ended September 30, 2018, primarily due to a $33.3 million expense to reduce the remaining carrying value of one of our Affiliates to zero, and a $4.0 million increase in amortization due to a reduction in the expected period of economic benefit for certain assets.Investment and other incomeThe following table presents our Investment and other income:  For the Three Months Ended September 30,   For the Nine Months Ended September 30,  (in millions)2017 2018 % Change 2017 2018 % ChangeInvestment and other income$16.1 $11.0 (32)% $46.7 $36.7 (21)%Investment and other income decreased $5.1 million or 32% in the three months ended September 30, 2018, primarily due to a decrease in realized gains on the sale of marketable securities, partially offset by an increase in the fair value of other investments, primarily attributable to the controlling interest. Investment and other income decreased $10.0 million or 21% in the nine months ended September 30, 2018, primarily due to a decrease in realized gains on the sale of marketable securities, partially offset by an increase in the fair value of other investments, primarily attributable to the controlling interest.Income Tax ExpenseThe following table presents our Income tax expense:  For the Three Months Ended September 30,   For the Nine Months Ended September 30,  (in millions)2017 2018 % Change 2017 2018 % ChangeIncome tax expense$66.1 $48.5 (27)% $188.2 $146.1 (22)%Income tax expense decreased $17.6 million or 27% in the three months ended September 30, 2018, primarily due to a decrease in Income before taxes (controlling interest) and a lower effective tax rate in 2018 due to the changes in U.S. tax laws enacted at the end of 2017.Income tax expense decreased $42.1 million or 22% in the nine months ended September 30, 2018, primarily due to a decrease in Income before taxes (controlling interest) and a lower effective tax rate in 2018 due to the changes in U.S. tax laws enacted at the end of 2017.Net Income The previously discussed changes in revenue and expenses had the following effect on Net income:32 For the Three Months Ended September 30,   For the Nine Months Ended September 30,  (in millions)2017 2018 % Change 2017 2018 % ChangeNet income$216.8 $201.9 (7)% $614.9 $631.1 3 %Net income (non-controlling interests)91.4 77.0 (16)% 240.7 236.2 (2)%Net income (controlling interest)125.4 124.9 (0 )% 374.2 394.9 6 %Supplemental Financial Performance Measures Adjusted EBITDA (controlling interest)As supplemental information, we provide a non-GAAP measure that we refer to as Adjusted EBITDA (controlling interest). Adjusted EBITDA (controlling interest) is an important supplemental financial performance measure for management as it provides a comprehensive view of our share of the financial performance of our business before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, impairments and adjustments to our contingent payment arrangements. This non-GAAP performance measure is provided in addition to, but not as a substitute for, Net income (controlling interest) or other GAAP performance measures.

For our equity method Affiliates, we do not separately report intangible amortization and impairments in our Consolidated Statements of Income. Our share of these Affiliates’ amortization is reported in Equity method income (net).

We consider Economic net income (controlling interest) and Economic 33earnings per share to be important measures of our financial performance, as we believe they best represent performance before our share of non-cash expenses relating to our acquisition of interests in our Affiliates, and they are, therefore, employed as our principal performance measures. Economic net income (controlling interest) and Economic earnings per share are used by our management and Board of Directors as our principal performance benchmarks, including as one of the measures for aligning executive compensation with stockholder value. These measures are provided in addition to, but not as substitutes for, Net income (controlling interest) and Earnings per share (diluted) or other GAAP performance measures. Under our Economic net income (controlling interest) definition, we add to Net income (controlling interest) our share of pre-tax intangible amortization and impairments (including the portion attributable to equity method investments in Affiliates), deferred taxes related to intangible assets, and other economic items, which include non-cash imputed interest (principally related to the accounting for convertible securities and contingent payment arrangements) and certain Affiliate equity expenses. We add back intangible amortization and impairments because these expenses do not correspond to the changes in value of these assets, which do not diminish predictably over time. The portion of deferred taxes generally attributable to intangible assets (including goodwill) is added back because we believe it is unlikely these accruals will be used to settle material tax obligations. We add back non-cash imputed interest and reductions or increases in contingent payment arrangements to better reflect our contractual interest obligations. We add back non-cash expenses relating to certain transfers of equity between Affiliate partners when these transfers have no dilutive effect to shareholders.Economic earnings per share represents Economic net income (controlling interest) divided by the Average sharesoutstanding (adjusted diluted). In this calculation, the potential share issuance in connection with our convertible securities ismeasured using a “treasury stock” method. Under this method, only the net number of shares of common stock equal to thevalue of these convertible securities in excess of par, if any, is deemed to be outstanding. We believe the inclusion of net sharesunder a treasury stock method best reflects the benefit of the increase in available capital resources (which could be used torepurchase shares of common stock) that occurs when these securities are converted and we are relieved of our debt obligation. This method does not take into account any increase or decrease in our cost of capital in an assumed conversion.The following table presents a reconciliation of Net income (controlling interest) to Economic net income (controlling interest): For the Three Months Ended September 30, For the Nine Months Ended September 30,(in millions, except per share data)2017 2018 2017 2018Net income (controlling interest)$125.4 $124.9 $374.2 $394.9Intangible amortization and impairments(1)42.2 44.9 121.5 166.9Intangible-related deferred taxes(2)22.9 12.2 61.8 30.1Other economic items(3)(4)0.8 2.0 5.7 2.9Economic net income (controlling interest)$191.3 $184.0 $563.2 $594.8Average shares outstanding (diluted)58.3 55.4 58.8 56.3Convertible securities shares(2.2) (2.2) (2.2) (2.2)Average shares outstanding (adjusted diluted)56.1 53.2 56.6 54.1Economic earnings per share$3.41 $3.45 $9.95 $10.99____________________________(1) See note (1) to the table in “Adjusted EBITDA (controlling interest).”  (2)  In the second quarter of 2018, we recorded a $33.3 million expense to reduce the remaining carrying value of one of our equity method Affiliates to zero, which reduced intangible-related deferred taxes by $8.3 million.(3) For the three months ended September 30, 2017 and 2018, Other economic items were net of income tax expense of $0.3 million and $0.1 million, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2017 and 2018, Other economic items were net of income tax expense of $1.4 million and $0.0 million, respectively. (4) For the nine months ended September 30, 2017, we adjusted our estimate of a contingent payment arrangement and, accordingly, recorded a loss attributable to the controlling interest of $1.4 million ($0.9 million net of tax). For the nine months ended September 30, 2018, we adjusted our estimate of a contingent payment arrangement and, accordingly, recorded a gain attributable to the controlling interest of $1.0 million ($0.8 million net of tax), all of which occurred in the second quarter of 2018.34Liquidity and Capital ResourcesIn the nine months ended September 30, 2018, we met our cash requirements through cash generated by operating activities. Our principal uses of cash during the quarter were, and for the foreseeable future are expected to be, for repayments of senior debt, repurchases of common stock, distributions to Affiliate equity holders, repurchases of Affiliate equity interests, the payment of cash dividends on our common stock and general working capital purposes. We also expect that principal uses of cash will be for investments in new and existing Affiliates. We anticipate that cash flows from operations, together with borrowings under our revolver and proceeds from our equity distribution program, will be sufficient to support our cash flow needs for the foreseeable future.Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2017 and September 30, 2018 were $439.5 million and $448.1 million, respectively. The following table summarizes our operating, investing and financing cash flow activities: For the Nine Months Ended September 30,(in millions)2017 2018Operating cash flow$800.5 $876.2Investing cash flow4.9 (20.9)Financing cash flow(871.5) (841.7)Operating Cash FlowIn the nine months ended September 30, 2018, operating cash flows increased $75.7 million, which was primarily attributable to the controlling interest, principally from cash distributions of our share of equity method earnings and an increase in net income. Cash flow from operating activities attributable to the non-controlling interest did not change significantly in the nine months ended September 30, 2018.Investing Cash FlowIn the nine months ended September 30, 2018, investing cash flows decreased $25.8 million, primarily due to a change in investment securities activity from a net sale of investment securities in 2017 of $49.1 million to net purchases in 2018 of $0.1 million, partially offset by a decrease in investments in Affiliates of $23.0 million.Financing Cash FlowIn the nine months ended September 30, 2018, financing cash flows increased $29.8 million, primarily due to an increase in net borrowings of senior debt of $188.5 million and a decrease in net Affiliate equity repurchases of $14.5 million. These increases were partially offset by increases in net repurchases of shares of our common stock of $175.3 million.Senior Debt and Convertible SecuritiesThe following table presents the carrying value of our outstanding indebtedness:(in millions)December 31, 2017 September 30, 2018Senior bank debt$810.0 $792.9Senior notes745.7 746.1 Senior debt$1,555.7 $1,539.0    Convertible securities$309.9 $311.8Senior Bank DebtWe have a $1.45 billion senior unsecured multicurrency revolving credit facility (the “revolver”). Subject to certain conditions, we may further increase the commitments under the revolver by up to $350.0 million. As of September 30, 2018, outstanding borrowings under the revolver were $415.0 million. We also have a senior unsecured term loan facility (the “term loan” and, together with the revolver, the “credit facilities”). During the nine months ended September 30, 2018, we amended and refinanced the term loan to adjust the interest rates and the 35maturity date, and to convert our denomination to pound sterling. The commercial terms of the loan otherwise remained the same. As discussed further in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we designated the term loan as a net investment hedge. As of September 30, 2018, the term loan borrowings totaled £290.0 million and, subject to certain conditions, could be increased by an additional £50.0 million. The revolver matures on September 30, 2020 and the term loan matures on May 31, 2021.In October 2018, we further amended our senior unsecured term loan facility to convert its denomination from pound sterling to U.S. dollars and to increase the borrowings to $450.0 million, with the ability to borrow an additional $75.0 million, subject to certain conditions. We pay interest on any outstanding obligations under the term loan at specified rates, based either on the U.S. dollar LIBOR rate or the prime rate as in effect from time to time. The other commercial terms of the term loan, including maturity date, remained the same. In connection with the conversion, we de-designated the term loan as a net investment hedge.The credit facilities contain financial covenants with respect to leverage and interest coverage, as well as customary affirmative and negative covenants, including limitations on priority indebtedness, asset dispositions and fundamental corporate changes, and certain customary events of default. As of September 30, 2018, we were in compliance with all terms of our credit facilities and had approximately $1 billion of remaining capacity under our revolver, all of which we could borrow and remain in compliance with our credit facilities.Our ability to draw funding from the debt and capital markets globally is a significant source of liquidity for us, and our credit ratings, among other factors, allow us to access these sources of funding on favorable terms. We are currently rated A3 by Moody’s Investors Service and A- by S&P Global Ratings.Convertible SecuritiesAs of September 30, 2018, we had 5.15% junior convertible trust preferred securities outstanding (the “junior convertible securities”). Effective August 10, 2018 and in accordance with the convertible securities indenture, we adjusted the conversion rate of the junior convertible securities from 0.2500 shares of common stock to 0.2525 shares of common stock per $50.00 junior convertible security, equivalent to an adjusted conversion price of $198.02 per share of common stock. The adjustment was the result of our cumulative declared dividends on our common stock since the initiation of our dividend through August 2018.Equity Distribution ProgramWe have equity distribution and forward equity agreements with several major securities firms under which we may, from time to time, issue and sell shares of our common stock (immediately or on a forward basis) having an aggregate sales price of up to $500.0 million (the “equity distribution program”). As of September 30, 2018, no sales have occurred under the equity distribution program.DerivativesOn August 28, 2018, we entered into a pound sterling-denominated forward foreign currency contract (the “forward contract”) with a large financial institution (the “counterparty”) to deliver £285.8 million for $400.0 million in 2024. Concurrent with entering into the forward contract, we entered into a collar contract (the “collar contract”) with the same counterparty, for the same notional amounts and expiration date as the forward contract, through the sale of a put option with a lower strike price of 1.288 U.S. dollars per one pound sterling and the purchase of a call option with an upper strike price of 1.535 U.S. dollars per one pound sterling. In October 2018, we entered into an additional pound sterling-denominated forward foreign currency contract to deliver £325.3 million for $450.0 million in 2021, and an additional collar contract with the same counterparty, for the same notional amounts and expiration date as the forward contract through the sale of a put option with a lower strike price of 1.318 U.S. dollars per one pound sterling and the purchase of a call option with an upper strike price of 1.448 U.S. dollars per one pound sterling. The forward contracts and the collar contracts provide net settlement rights. The forward contracts and the collar contracts were designated as net investment hedges against fluctuations in exchange rates on certain of our investments in Affiliates with the pound sterling as their functional currency. See Note 8 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.36Affiliate EquityMany of our consolidated Affiliate agreements provide us with a conditional right to call and Affiliate equity holders with the conditional right to put their Affiliate equity interests to us at certain intervals. For equity method Affiliates, we do not typically have such put and call arrangements. The purchase price of these conditional purchases is generally calculated based upon a multiple of the Affiliate’s cash flow distributions, which is intended to represent fair value. Affiliate equity holders are also permitted to sell their equity interests to other individuals or entities in certain cases, subject to our approval or other restrictions.As of September 30, 2018, our current redemption value of $968.9 million for these interests has been presented as Redeemable non-controlling interests. Although the timing and amounts of these purchases are difficult to predict, we paid $104.3 million for repurchases and received $6.3 million for issuances of Affiliate equity during the nine months ended September 30, 2018, and expect to repurchase a total of approximately $125 million in 2018. In the event of a repurchase, we become the owner of the cash flow associated with the repurchased equity.CommitmentsSee Note 5 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.Share RepurchasesDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, we repurchased 0.8 million and 2.5 million shares of our common stock, respectively, at an average price per share of $146.85 and $166.19, respectively. As of September 30, 2018, we had 2.5 million shares remaining under our authorized share repurchase program, which has no expiry. Contractual ObligationsThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of September 30, 2018. Contractual debt obligations include the cash payment of fixed interest.

This table also does not include potential obligations relating to our derivative financial instruments, which are dependent on pound sterling to U.S. dollar foreign currency exchange rates at the settlement dates. See Note 8 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.(2) The controlling interest portion is $3.2 million through 2018, $22.7 million in 2019-2020, $18.7 million in 2021-2022 and $22.3 million thereafter.(3) The contingent payment arrangements disclosed in the table represent the expected settlement amounts. The maximum settlement amount through 2018 is $160.2 million, $2.5 million in 2019-2020 and none thereafter.37Recent Accounting Developments See Note 2 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.Item 3.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskThere have been no material changes to our Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in the three months ended September 30, 2018. Please refer to the below as well as the additional disclosures in Item 7A of our 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Foreign Currency Exchange RiskTo illustrate the effect of possible changes in currency exchange rates, we estimate a 1% change in the pound sterling and Canadian dollar to U.S. dollar exchange rates would have resulted in changes to stockholders’ equity of $4.7 million and $2.1 million, respectively, as of September 30, 2018, and annual changes to Income before income taxes (controlling interest) of $1.1 million and $0.3 million, respectively.Derivative RiskFrom time to time, we and our Affiliates seek to offset exposure to changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and markets by entering into derivative financial instruments. There can be no assurance that our or our Affiliates’ derivative financial instruments will meet their overall objective or that we or our Affiliates will be successful in entering into such instruments in the future. Further, if our or our Affiliates’ derivative counterparties fail to honor their obligations in a timely manner, including any obligations to return posted collateral, our liquidity and results of operations could be adversely impacted.  In the three months ended September 30, 2018, we entered into derivative financial instruments to mitigate the potential risk of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. See Note 8 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.Item 4.Controls and ProceduresWe carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures during the quarter covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the quarter covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective in ensuring that (i) the information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms, and (ii) such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, we recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and our management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating and implementing possible controls and procedures. Our disclosure controls and procedures were designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their stated objectives, and our principal executive officer and principal financial officers concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. We review on an ongoing basis and document our disclosure controls and procedures, and our internal control over financial reporting, and we may from time to time make changes in an effort to enhance their effectiveness and ensure that our systems evolve with our business.No change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) occurred during the quarter covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.PART II—OTHER INFORMATIONItem 2.Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
