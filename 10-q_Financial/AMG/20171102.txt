Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016.These factors (among others) could affect our financial performance and cause actual results to differ materially from historical earnings and those presently anticipated and projected. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we will not undertake and we specifically disclaim any obligation to release publicly the result of any revisions that may be made to any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements or to reflect the occurrence of events, whether or not anticipated. In that respect, we caution readers not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements.Management’s Discussion and Analysis should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.Executive OverviewWe are a global asset management company with equity investments in leading boutique investment management firms, which we refer to as our “Affiliates.” Our innovative partnership approach allows each Affiliate’s management team to own significant equity in their firm and maintain operational autonomy. Our strategy is to generate shareholder value through the growth of existing Affiliates, as well as through investments in new Affiliates and additional investments in existing Affiliates. In addition, we provide centralized assistance to our Affiliates in strategic matters, marketing, distribution, product development and operations. As of September 30, 2017, our aggregate assets under management were $803.7 billion, in more than 550 investment products across a broad range of active, return-oriented strategies.We hold meaningful equity interests in each of our Affiliates. In certain cases, we consolidate the Affiliate’s financial results in our Revenue, Operating expenses and Non-operating (income) and expenses. In other cases, we use the equity method of accounting and our share of the Affiliate’s financial results is reported (net of intangible amortization) in Income from equity method investments. While we account for a majority of our Affiliates on a consolidated basis of accounting, a growing number of our Affiliates are accounted for on an equity method basis and are integral to our operations. Accordingly, Income from equity method investments is included in Operating income.Whether we account for an Affiliate on a consolidated or equity method basis of accounting, we generally maintain the same partnership approach and provide support and assistance in substantially the same manner, and our operating model is generally the same. Furthermore, our Affiliates are impacted by similar marketplace factors and operational trends, which may not be observable when analyzing the financial results of our consolidated and equity method Affiliates separately. Therefore, we believe our aggregate operating measures of assets under management, average assets under management and aggregate revenue, which incorporate the assets under management and revenues of all of our Affiliates, regardless of the accounting treatment, have become increasingly important in providing management and investors with a more comprehensive view of the operating performance and material trends across our entire business. Aggregate revenue is calculated by combining the Revenue of our consolidated Affiliates with equity method revenue. We discuss both Revenue at our consolidated Affiliates and equity method revenue in our Results of Operations. Equity method revenue and aggregate revenue are provided in addition to, but not as substitutes for, Revenue at our consolidated Affiliates.The following table presents our key operating performance measures:22  As of and for the Three Months Ended September 30,   As of and for the Nine Months Ended September 30,  (in billions, except as noted) 2016 2017 % Change 2016 2017 % ChangeAssets under management(1)            Consolidated Affiliate assets under management $378.8 $416.3 10% $378.8 $416.3 10%Equity method Affiliate assets under management 293.6 387.4 32% 293.6 387.4 32%Total  $672.4 $803.7 20% $672.4 $803.7 20%             Average assets under management(1)            Consolidated Affiliate average assets under management $378.0 $414.5 10% $371.9 $400.9 8%Equity method Affiliate average assets under management 285.5 376.1 32% 273.6 365.6 34%Total  $663.5 $790.6 19% $645.5 $766.5 19%             Revenue (in millions) $544.7 $585.7 8% $1,644.2 $1,700.9 3%Equity method revenue (in millions)(2) 456.4 686.6 50% 1,350.5 2,159.8 60%__________________________(1) Assets under management is presented on a current basis without regard to the timing of the inclusion of an Affiliate’s financial results in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Average assets under management provides a more meaningful relationship to our financial and operating results as it reflects both the particular billing patterns of Affiliate sponsored products and client accounts and corresponds with the timing of the inclusion of an Affiliate's financial results in our Consolidated Financial Statements.(2) Equity method revenue consists of asset based revenue and performance fees earned by our equity method Affiliates. Assets Under ManagementThrough our Affiliates, we manage active return-oriented strategies rather than passive or indexing strategies, fixed income or money market products, which typically carry lower fee rates. We continue to see meaningful client demand for active return-oriented strategies, particularly in alternative and multi-asset strategies, reflecting continued investor demand for returns that are less correlated to traditional equity and fixed income markets. Investor demand for passively managed and indexing strategies has continued, particularly for the large cap U.S. equity portion of client portfolios, and we have experienced outflows in U.S. equity strategies consistent with this industry-wide trend. We expect client demand for alternative and multi-asset strategies to continue, and believe the best-performing active equity managers (whether global-, regional- or country-specific) will continue to have significant opportunities to grow from net client cash inflows. We believe we are well positioned to benefit from these trends.The following charts and tables provide information regarding the composition of and changes in our assets under management on a current basis by active return-oriented strategy and client type:23__________________(1) Alternatives primarily include assets under management in long and short public equity, control equity, managed futures, multi-strategy, and other alternative and hedge fund strategies, as well as energy and infrastructure investments and primary and secondary private equity strategies. Alternative strategies generate earnings from (i) management fees from products subject to lock-ups or similar restrictions, (ii) management fees from products not subject to such restrictions and/or (iii) performance fees and carried interest.(2) Global equities include emerging markets strategies, which accounted for 10% of our aggregate assets under management as of September 30, 2017.By Strategy - Quarter to Date(in billions)Alternatives Global Equities U.S. Equities Multi-asset & Other TotalJune 30, 2017$296.3 $267.9 $110.7 $97.2 $772.1 Client cash inflows and commitments20.7 7.3 3.8 3.9 35.7 Client cash outflows and realizations(10.4) (11.9) (7.0) (3.3) (32.6) Net client cash flows10.3 (4.6) (3.2) 0.6 3.1 Market changes5.6 13.6 4.1 0.9 24.2 Foreign exchange(1)1.4 2.4 0.2 0.5 4.5 Other(0.2) — — — (0.2)September 30, 2017$313.4 $279.3 $111.8 $99.2 $803.7By Client Type - Quarter to Date(in billions)Institutional Retail High Net Worth TotalJune 30, 2017$457.4 $207.1 $107.6 $772.1Client cash inflows and commitments16.3 15.5 3.9 35.7Client cash outflows and realizations(20.1) (9.3) (3.2) (32.6)Net client cash flows(3.8) 6.2 0.7 3.1Market changes14.8 7.0 2.4 24.2Foreign exchange(1)2.7 1.4 0.4 4.5Other(0.2) — — (0.2)September 30, 2017$470.9 $221.7 $111.1 $803.7By Strategy - Year to Date(in billions)Alternatives Global Equities U.S. Equities Multi-asset & Other TotalDecember 31, 2016$252.4 $233.9 $110.1 $92.3 $688.7 Client cash inflows and commitments47.3 25.1 10.6 12.8 95.8 Client cash outflows and realizations(27.9) (30.6) (21.6) (12.0) (92.1) Net client cash flows19.4 (5.5) (11.0) 0.8 3.7 New investments30.6 1.5 — 3.3 35.4 Market changes8.3 43.8 12.5 5.0 69.6 Foreign exchange(1)4.0 6.0 0.3 1.4 11.7 Other(1.3) (0.4) (0.1) (3.6) (5.4)September 30, 2017$313.4 $279.3 $111.8 $99.2 $803.7By Client Type - Year to Date24(in billions)Institutional Retail High Net Worth TotalDecember 31, 2016$401.2 $188.3 $99.2 $688.7Client cash inflows and commitments44.2 39.3 12.3 95.8Client cash outflows and realizations(50.5) (31.4) (10.2) (92.1)Net client cash flows(6.3) 7.9 2.1 3.7New Investments31.0 1.2 3.2 35.4Market changes39.6 20.5 9.5 69.6Foreign exchange(1)7.0 4.0 0.7 11.7Other(1.6) (0.2) (3.6) (5.4)September 30, 2017$470.9 $221.7 $111.1 $803.7_________________________(1) Foreign exchange reflects the impact of translating non-U.S. dollar denominated assets under management into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes.In addition to assets under management, we also report average assets under management. Average assets under management provides a more meaningful relationship to our financial and operating results as it reflects both the particular billing patterns of Affiliate sponsored products and client accounts and corresponds with the timing of the inclusion of an Affiliate’s financial results in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Average assets under management increased $127.1 billion or 19% in the three months ended September 30, 2017 compared to the corresponding period in the prior year, due to a 32% increase in average assets under management at equity method Affiliates and a 10% increase in average assets under management at consolidated Affiliates. Average assets under management increased $121.0 billion or 19% in the nine months ended September 30, 2017 compared to the corresponding period in the prior year, due to a 34% increase in average assets under management at equity method Affiliates and a 8% increase in average assets under management at consolidated Affiliates. Aggregate RevenueAggregate revenue is calculated by combining the Revenue of our consolidated Affiliates with equity method revenue. Aggregate revenue and equity method revenue are provided in addition to, but not as substitutes for, Revenue at our consolidated Affiliates. We derive our aggregate revenue primarily from asset based revenue and performance fees from investment management services. Asset based revenue includes advisory and other fees earned by our Affiliates for services provided to their clients and are typically determined as a percentage of the value of a client’s assets under management. Performance fees are billed based upon investment performance, typically on an absolute basis or relative to a benchmark. Our ratio of asset based revenue to average assets under management (“asset based revenue ratio”), either in the aggregate or separately for consolidated Affiliates or equity method Affiliates, is calculated as asset based revenue divided by average assets under management for the respective Affiliates. Our asset based revenue ratios may change as a result of new investments, client cash flows, market changes, foreign exchange or changes in contractual fees.The following table presents the Revenue of our consolidated Affiliates and equity method revenue, and when combined, aggregate revenue:  For the Three Months Ended September 30,   For the Nine Months Ended September 30,  (in millions) 2016 2017 % Change 2016 2017 % ChangeRevenue $544.7 $585.7 8% $1,644.2 $1,700.9 3%Equity method revenue 456.4 686.6 50% 1,350.5 2,159.8 60%Aggregate revenue increased 27% in the three months ended September 30, 2017. This increase was due to a $230.2 million or 50% increase in equity method revenue and a $41.0 million or 8% increase in Revenue at our consolidated Affiliates. The increase in equity method revenue was due to an increase of $166.8 million or 36% from asset based revenue and an 25increase of $63.4 million or 14% from performance fees. The increase in Revenue at our consolidated Affiliates was due to an increase of $38.2 million or 7% from asset based revenue and a $2.8 million or 1% increase from performance fees. Aggregate revenue increased 29% in the nine months ended September 30, 2017, due to an increase in equity method revenue of $809.3 million or 60% and a $56.7 million or 3% increase in Revenue at our consolidated Affiliates. The increase in equity method revenue was due to an increase of $532.9 million or 40% from asset based revenue and an increase of $276.4 million or 20% from performance fees. The increase in Revenue at our consolidated Affiliates was due to a $70.1 million or 4% increase from asset based revenue, partially offset by a $13.4 million or 1% decrease from performance fees. See Results of Operations for a further discussion of the changes in Revenue at our consolidated Affiliates and equity method revenue.Financial and Supplemental Financial Performance MeasuresThe following table presents our key financial and supplemental financial performance measures:  For the Three Months Ended September 30,   For the Nine Months Ended September 30,  (in millions) 2016 2017 % Change 2016 2017 % ChangeNet income (controlling interest) $110.2 $125.4 14% $322.5 $374.2 16%Adjusted EBITDA (controlling interest)(1) 219.8 256.3 17% 655.8 754.8 15%Economic net income (controlling interest)(1) 165.5 191.3 16% 492.3 563.2 14%__________________________(1) Adjusted EBITDA (controlling interest) and Economic net income (controlling interest) are non-GAAP performance measures and are discussed in “Supplemental Financial Performance Measures.”We believe Adjusted EBITDA (controlling interest) is an important supplemental financial performance measure for our management and investors. Adjusted EBITDA (controlling interest) provides a comprehensive view of our share of the financial performance of our entire business before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, impairments and adjustments to our contingent payment obligations. Conversely, our GAAP financial performance measures, Operating income and Income before income taxes, include the non-controlling interest’s share of financial performance.Our ownership level of consolidated Affiliates is higher than our ownership level of our equity method Affiliates and, as a result, we experience a greater proportion of an increase or decrease in Revenue from our consolidated Affiliates than an increase or decrease in our equity method revenue. While our equity method revenue increased 50% in the three months ended September 30, 2017, our Revenue from consolidated Affiliates increased 8%, resulting in a $36.5 million or 17% increase in Adjusted EBITDA (controlling interest). In the nine months ended September 30, 2017, our equity method revenue increased 60%, while our Revenue from consolidated Affiliates increased 3%, resulting in a $99.0 million or 15% increase in Adjusted EBITDA (controlling interest). Our Net income (controlling interest) increased $15.2 million or 14% and $51.7 million or 16% in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017, respectively, which was consistent with the 17% and 15% increases in Adjusted EBITDA (controlling interest) during the respective periods. We consider Economic net income (controlling interest) to be an important measure of our financial performance, as we believe it best represents our performance after tax and before our share of non-cash expenses relating to our acquisition of interests in our Affiliates. Our Economic net income (controlling interest) increased $25.8 million or 16% and $70.9 million or 14% in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017, respectively, which was consistent with the 17% and 15% increases in Adjusted EBITDA (controlling interest) during the respective periods. Results of OperationsThe following discussion includes the financial results of our consolidated and equity method Affiliates. Our consolidated Affiliates’ financial results are included in our Revenue, Operating expenses and Non-operating (income) and expenses, and our share of our equity method Affiliates’ financial results is reported (net of intangible amortization) in Income from equity method investments in Operating income. Revenue26The following table summarizes our consolidated Affiliate average assets under management and Revenue:  For the Three Months Ended September 30,   For the Nine Months Ended September 30,  (in millions, except as noted)2016 2017 % Change 2016 2017 % ChangeConsolidated Affiliates average assets under management (in billions)$378.0 $414.5 10% $371.9 $400.9 8%Revenue$544.7 $585.7 8% $1,644.2 $1,700.9 3%Our Revenue increased $41.0 million or 8% in the three months ended September 30, 2017, due to a $38.2 million or 7% increase from asset based revenue, and a $2.8 million or 1% increase from performance fees. The change in asset based revenue was due to a 10% increase in average assets under management, partially offset by a 2% decline in our asset based revenue ratio. The decline in our asset based revenue ratio was primarily due to changes in the composition of our average assets under management. Our Revenue increased $56.7 million or 3% in the nine months ended September 30, 2017, due to a $70.1 million or 4% increase from asset based revenue, partially offset by a $13.4 million or 1% decrease from performance fees. The change in asset based revenue was due to an 8% increase in average assets under management and a 3% decline in our asset based revenue ratio. The decline in our asset based revenue ratio was due to a decrease in asset based revenue related to renewal commissions at one of our Affiliates in the United Kingdom as a result of a regulatory change which was offset by a reduction in distribution expenses at the Affiliate which were reported in Selling, general and administrative expenses. The decline in our asset based revenue ratio was also due to changes in the composition of our average assets under management.Operating ExpensesThe following table summarizes our consolidated operating expenses: For the Three Months Ended September 30,   For the Nine Months Ended September 30,   % Change % Change(in millions)2016 2017  2016 2017 Compensation and related expenses$244.2 $238.7 (2)% $702.9 $722.9 3%Selling, general and administrative94.2 91.9 (2)% 286.7 269.7 (6)%Intangible amortization and impairments26.9 21.2 (21)% 82.2 65.1 (21)%Depreciation and other amortization5.0 4.8 (4)% 15.0 14.9 (1)%Other operating expenses (net)3.4 10.3 N.M.(1) 25.9 32.0 24%Total operating expenses$373.7 $366.9 (2)% $1,112.7 $1,104.6 (1)%___________________________(1) Percentage change is not meaningful.Our operating expenses are primarily attributable to the non-controlling interests because the substantial majority of these expenses are incurred by consolidated Affiliates with which we share in revenue without regard to expenses. For these Affiliates, the amount of their operating expenses, including compensation, is generally determined by the percentage of revenue allocated to operating expenses as part of the structured partnership interests in place at the respective Affiliate. Accordingly, our operating expenses are impacted by increases or decreases in a consolidated Affiliate’s revenue and corresponding increases or decreases in a consolidated Affiliate’s operating expenses.Compensation and related expenses decreased $5.5 million or 2% in the three months ended September 30, 2017, primarily due to a $11.9 million or 5% decrease from compensation expenses associated with Affiliate equity transactions, partially offset by an $8.0 million or 3% increase from compensation expenses at Affiliates. These changes primarily relate to the non-controlling interests.Compensation and related expenses increased $20.0 million or 3% in the nine months ended September 30, 2017, primarily due to a $17.0 million or 2% increase from compensation expenses at Affiliates and a $3.6 million or 1% increase from compensation expenses associated with Affiliate equity transactions. These changes primarily relate to the non-controlling interests.27There was no significant change in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the three months ended September 30, 2017. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $17.0 million or 6% in the nine months ended September 30, 2017, primarily due to a $8.8 million or 3% decrease from a reduction in distribution expenses, related to commissions at certain of our Affiliates in the United Kingdom and a $5.8 million or 2% decrease from a reduction of expenses in wealth management initiatives. Intangible amortization and impairments decreased $5.7 million or 21% in the three months ended September 30, 2017, due to a $3.3 million or 12% decrease from a change in the pattern of economic benefit for certain assets and a $2.4 million or 9% decrease from certain assets being fully amortized.Intangible amortization and impairments decreased $17.1 million or 21% in the nine months ended September 30, 2017, due to a $11.6 million or 14% decrease from a change in the pattern of economic benefit for certain assets and a $5.5 million or 7% decrease from certain assets being fully amortized.There were no significant changes in Depreciation and other amortization in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017. Other operating expenses (net) increased $6.9 million in the three months ended September 30, 2017, primarily from decreases in net gains on Affiliate sponsored consolidated investment products of $6.2 million. This change primarily relates to the non-controlling interests.Other operating expenses (net) increased $6.1 million or 24% in the nine months ended September 30, 2017, primarily from decreases in net gains on Affiliate sponsored consolidated investment products of $4.8 million or 19%. This change primarily relates to the non-controlling interests.Income from Equity Method InvestmentsFor equity method Affiliates, our share of an Affiliate’s earnings or losses is contractually calculated using a formula, which is based either on a fixed percentage of such Affiliate’s revenue without regard to expenses or by reference to such Affiliate’s revenue less certain agreed-upon expenses. Our share of an equity method Affiliate’s earnings or losses is reported (net of intangible amortization attributable to our investment in an Affiliate) in Income from equity method investments in Operating income. Additional investments in existing or new Affiliates will generally impact our financial results in the year of investment and, depending upon the timing, in the following year when the full-year financial results of the Affiliate investment are reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements.The following table summarizes equity method earnings and equity method intangible amortization, which together comprise Income from equity method investments, as well as equity method Affiliate average assets under management and equity method revenue. Equity method revenue is provided in addition to, but not as a substitute for, Revenue at our consolidated Affiliates.

The increase in asset based revenue was due to increases of $125.4 million or 27% from our 2016 investments in new Affiliates and $41.4 million or 9% from existing Affiliates. The increase in performance fees was due to a $57.8 million or 13% increase from existing Affiliates and a $5.6 million or 1% increase from our 2016 investments in new Affiliates.28While equity method revenue increased 50% in the three months ended September 30, 2017, equity method earnings increased $15.1 million or 19%, primarily due to our 2016 investments in new Affiliates, in which we own less of the equity interests than in our existing equity method Affiliates. Equity method intangible amortization increased $11.9 million or 85% in the three months ended September 30, 2017, due to our 2016 investments in new Affiliates.Our equity method revenue increased $809.3 million or 60% in the nine months ended September 30, 2017, due to a $532.9 million or 40% increase from asset based revenue and a $276.4 million or 20% increase from performance fees. The increase in asset based revenue was due to increases of $395.4 million or 29% from our 2016 investments in new Affiliates and $137.5 million or 10% from existing Affiliates. The increase in performance fees was due to a $238.2 million or 18% increase from performance fees from our 2016 investments in new Affiliates and a $38.1 million or 3% increase from existing Affiliates.While equity method revenue increased 60% in the nine months ended September 30, 2017, equity method earnings increased $59.6 million or 24%, primarily due to our 2016 investments in new Affiliates, in which we own less of the equity interests than in our existing equity method Affiliates. Equity method intangible amortization increased $28.7 million or 67% in the nine months ended September 30, 2017, due to a $22.9 million or 53% increase from our 2016 investments in new Affiliates and a $5.8 million or 14% increase from a change in the pattern of economic benefit related to assets at certain existing Affiliates.Non-Operating (Income) and ExpensesThe following table summarizes non-operating income and expense data: For the Three Months Ended September 30,   For the Nine Months Ended September 30,  (in millions)2016 2017 % Change 2016 2017 % ChangeInvestment and other income$(11.0) $(15.6) 42 % $(26.7) $(44.7) 67 %Interest expense22.4 21.5 (4)% 66.4 65.8 (1)%Imputed interest expense and contingent payment arrangements0.9 0.7 (22)% (0.2) 3.7 N.M.(1)Income taxes50.3 66.1 31 % 159.7 188.2 18 %___________________________(1) Percentage change is not meaningful.Investment and other income increased $4.6 million or 42% in the three months ended September 30, 2017, primarily due to a $2.9 million or 26% increase from changes in the fair value of investments and a $1.4 million or 13% increase from realized gains on the sale of investment securities. Investment and other income increased $18.0 million or 67% in the nine months ended September 30, 2017, primarily due to a $14.2 million or 53% increase from changes in the fair value of investments and a $5.7 million or 21% increase from realized gains on the sale of investment securities, partially offset by a $1.7 million or 6% decrease from lower dividend income. There were no significant changes in Interest expense in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017. There was no significant change in Imputed interest expense and contingent payment arrangements in the three months ended September 30, 2017. Imputed interest and contingent payment arrangements increased $3.9 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2017, primarily due to a $2.8 million gain on the revaluation of a contingent payment arrangement in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, which did not recur, and a $1.4 million expense on the revaluation of a contingent payment arrangement in the nine months ended September 30, 2017.Income taxes increased $15.8 million or 31% and $28.5 million or 18% in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017, respectively, primarily due to an increase in Income before income taxes attributable to the controlling interest, partially offset by stock compensation tax benefits. In the three months ended September 30, 2016, we also recognized a benefit due to the reduction in corporate tax rates in the United Kingdom, which did not recur in 2017.Net Income 29The previously discussed changes in Revenue, expenses and Income from equity method investments had the following effect on Net income: For the Three Months Ended September 30,   For the Nine Months Ended September 30,  (in millions)2016 2017 % Change 2016 2017 % ChangeNet income$175.9 $216.8 23% $533.0 $614.9 15%Net income (non-controlling interests)65.7 91.4 39% 210.5 240.7 14%Net income (controlling interest)110.2 125.4 14% 322.5 374.2 16%Supplemental Financial Performance Measures Adjusted EBITDA (controlling interest)As supplemental information, we provide a non-GAAP measure that we refer to as Adjusted EBITDA (controlling interest). Adjusted EBITDA (controlling interest) represents our earnings before our share of interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, amortization, impairments and adjustments to our contingent payment obligations. We believe that many investors use this information when assessing the financial performance of companies in the investment management industry. This non-GAAP measure is provided in addition to, but not as a substitute for, Net income (controlling interest) or any other GAAP measures of financial performance. The following table provides a reconciliation of Net income (controlling interest) to Adjusted EBITDA (controlling interest): For the Three Months Ended September 30, For the Nine Months Ended September 30,(in millions)2016 2017 2016 2017Net income (controlling interest)$110.2 $125.4 $322.5 $374.2Interest expense22.4 21.5 66.4 65.8Imputed interest expense and contingent payment arrangements(1)0.9 0.7 (0.2) 3.7Income taxes50.1 64.1 155.6 182.5Depreciation and other amortization2.0 2.4 5.9 7.1Intangible amortization and impairments(2)34.2 42.2 105.6 121.5Adjusted EBITDA (controlling interest)$219.8 $256.3 $655.8 $754.8___________________________(1) For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2017, Imputed interest expense and contingent payment arrangements include gains from adjustments to our contingent payment obligations of $2.8 million ($1.7 million net of tax) and expenses from adjustments to our contingent payment obligations of $1.4 million ($0.9 million net of tax), respectively. There were no contingent payment adjustments in the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2017.(2) Our reported intangible amortization includes amortization attributable to our non-controlling interests. For our equity method Affiliates, we do not separately report intangible amortization in our Consolidated Statements of Income. Our share of these Affiliates’ amortization is reported in Income from equity method investments. The following table summarizes the Intangible amortization and impairments shown above:  For the Three Months Ended September 30, For the Nine Months Ended September 30,(in millions)2016 2017 2016 2017Reported Intangible amortization and impairments$26.9 $21.2 $82.2 $65.1Intangible amortization (non-controlling interests)(6.7) (4.9) (19.6) (15.3)Equity method intangible amortization14.0 25.9 43.0 71.7Total$34.2 $42.2 $105.6 $121.530Economic Net Income (controlling interest) and Economic Earnings Per ShareAs supplemental information, we also provide non-GAAP measures that we refer to as Economic net income (controlling interest) and Economic earnings per share. We consider Economic net income (controlling interest) and Economic earnings per share to be important measures of our financial performance, as we believe they best represent our performance before our share of non-cash expenses relating to our acquisition of interests in our Affiliates, and they are, therefore, employed as our principal financial performance measures. Economic net income (controlling interest) and Economic earnings per share are used by our management and Board of Directors as our principal performance benchmarks, including as one of the measures for aligning executive compensation with stockholder value. These measures are provided in addition to, but not as substitutes for, other GAAP measures of financial performance, such as Net income (controlling interest) and Earnings per share (diluted).Under our Economic net income (controlling interest) definition, we add to Net income (controlling interest) our share of pre-tax intangible amortization and impairments (including the portion attributable to equity method Affiliates), deferred taxes related to intangible assets, and other economic items, which include non-cash imputed interest (principally related to the accounting for convertible securities and contingent payment arrangements) and certain Affiliate equity expenses. We add back intangible amortization and impairments attributable to acquired client relationships because these expenses do not correspond to the changes in value of these assets, which do not diminish predictably over time. The portion of deferred taxes generally attributable to intangible assets (including goodwill) is added back because we believe it is unlikely these accruals will be used to settle material tax obligations. We add back non-cash imputed interest and reductions or increases in contingent payment arrangements to better reflect our contractual interest obligations. We add back non-cash expenses relating to certain transfers of equity between Affiliate partners when these transfers have no dilutive effect to shareholders.Economic earnings per share represents Economic net income (controlling interest) divided by the Average shares outstanding (adjusted diluted). In this calculation, the potential share issuance in connection with our convertible securities is measured using a “treasury stock” method. Under this method, only the net number of shares of common stock equal to the value of these convertible securities in excess of par, if any, is deemed to be outstanding. We believe the inclusion of net shares under a treasury stock method best reflects the benefit of the increase in available capital resources (which could be used to repurchase shares of common stock) that occurs when these securities are converted and we are relieved of our debt obligation. This method does not take into account any increase or decrease in our cost of capital in an assumed conversion.The following table provides a reconciliation of Net income (controlling interest) to Economic net income (controlling interest): For the Three Months Ended September 30, For the Nine Months Ended September 30,(in millions, except per share data)2016 2017 2016 2017Net income (controlling interest)$110.2 $125.4 $322.5 $374.2Intangible amortization and impairments(1)34.2 42.2 105.6 121.5Intangible-related deferred taxes19.5 22.9 63.0 61.8Other economic items(2)(3)1.6 0.8 1.2 5.7Economic net income (controlling interest)$165.5 $191.3 $492.3 $563.2Average shares outstanding (diluted)56.6 58.3 56.6 58.8Assumed issuance of junior convertible securities shares(2.2) (2.2) (2.2) (2.2)Average shares outstanding (adjusted diluted)54.4 56.1 54.4 56.6Economic earnings per share$3.04 $3.41 $9.04 $9.95____________________________(1) See note (2) to the table in “Adjusted EBITDA (controlling interest).”  (2) See note (1) to the table in “Adjusted EBITDA (controlling interest).”  (3) For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2017, Other economic items were net of income tax expense of $0.1 million and $0.3 million, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2017, Other economic items were net of an income tax benefit of $0.1 million and income tax expense of $1.4 million, respectively. Liquidity and Capital ResourcesDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2017, we met our cash requirements primarily through cash generated by operating activities. Our principal uses of cash during the quarter were, and for the foreseeable future are expected to be, for 31repayments of senior debt, distributions to Affiliate equity holders, repurchases of common stock, Affiliate equity repurchases, the payment of cash dividends on our common stock, and general working capital purposes. We also expect that a principal use of cash will be for investments in new and existing Affiliates. We anticipate that cash flows from operations, together with borrowings under our revolver and proceeds from our equity distribution program, will be sufficient to support our cash flow needs for the foreseeable future. Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2016 and September 30, 2017 were $430.8 million and $374.7 million, respectively, including $18.9 million and $24.9 million, respectively, in our wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries, which could be repatriated without accruing or paying any significant additional U.S. taxes. The following table summarizes our cash flow activities: For the Nine Months Ended September 30,(in millions)2016 2017Operating cash flow$684.5 $800.5Investing cash flow(868.7) 4.9Financing cash flow36.6 (871.5)Operating Cash FlowIn the nine months ended September 30, 2017, Cash flow from operating activities increased $116.0 million, of which approximately 70% was attributable to the controlling interest. Cash flow from operating activities attributable to the controlling interest increased primarily from the receipt of cash distributions of our share of equity method earnings from our 2016 investments in new Affiliates.Investing Cash FlowIn the nine months ended September 30, 2017, Cash flows from investing activities, which is primarily attributable to the controlling interest, increased $873.6 million, primarily due to a decrease in Investments in Affiliates of $854.6 million.Financing Cash FlowIn the nine months ended September 30, 2017, Cash flows used in financing activities, which is primarily attributable to the controlling interest, increased $908.1 million. This increase was primarily due to a change in senior debt activity from net borrowings of $230.0 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 to net repayments of $200.0 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2017. This increase was also due to an increase in repurchases of common stock of $243.0 million and a decrease in cash received for the issuance of common stock of $129.5 million. The following table summarizes the carrying value of our outstanding indebtedness:(in millions)December 31, 2016 September 30, 2017Senior bank debt$870.0 $870.0Senior notes945.1 745.5Convertible securities307.5 309.3Senior Bank Debt and Senior NotesWe have a $1.45 billion senior unsecured multicurrency revolving credit facility (the “revolver”) and a $385.0 million senior unsecured term loan facility (the “term loan” and, together with the revolver, the “credit facilities”). The credit facilities both mature on September 30, 2020. The credit facilities contain financial covenants with respect to leverage and interest coverage, as well as customary affirmative and negative covenants, including limitations on priority indebtedness, asset dispositions and fundamental corporate changes, and certain customary events of default. As of September 30, 2017, we were in compliance with all terms of our credit facilities and had approximately $1 billion of remaining capacity under our revolver, all of which we could borrow and remain in compliance with our credit facilities. 32In the three months ended September 30, 2017, we redeemed all $200.0 million principal amount outstanding of our 6.375% senior unsecured notes due 2042 at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount. The notes were subsequently canceled and retired. We are currently rated A3 by Moody’s Investors Service and A- by S&P Global Ratings. A downgrade of our credit rating, including a downgrade to below investment grade, would not trigger a default or have any other significant impact on the terms of our existing credit facilities. A reduction in our credit rating could, however, increase our borrowing costs. Additionally, a downgrade of our credit rating below investment grade in connection with a change in control would require us to make a repurchase offer on our senior notes.Equity Distribution ProgramIn 2016, we entered into equity distribution and forward equity agreements with several major securities firms under which we, from time to time, may issue and sell shares of our common stock (immediately or on a forward basis) having an aggregate sales price of up to $500.0 million (the “equity distribution program”). As of September 30, 2017, no sales have occurred under the equity distribution program. Affiliate EquityMany of our Affiliate agreements provide us with a conditional right to call and Affiliate equity holders with the conditional right to put their Affiliate equity interests to us at certain intervals. For equity method Affiliates, we do not typically have such put and call arrangements. The purchase price of these conditional purchases is generally calculated based upon a multiple of the Affiliate’s cash flow distributions, which is intended to represent fair value. Affiliate equity holders are also permitted to sell their equity interests to other individuals or entities in certain cases, subject to our approval or other restrictions.As of September 30, 2017, our current redemption value of $804.6 million for these interests has been presented as Redeemable non-controlling interests. Although the timing and amounts of these purchases are difficult to predict, we repurchased $161.5 million of Affiliate equity during the nine months ended September 30, 2017, and expect to repurchase approximately $10 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. In the event of a repurchase, we become the owner of the cash flow associated with the repurchased equity.CommitmentsWe have committed to co-invest in certain investment partnerships. As of September 30, 2017, these unfunded commitments totaled $94.9 million and may be called in future periods. As of September 30, 2017, we were contingently liable, upon achievement by certain Affiliates of specified financial targets, to make payments related to our investments in Affiliates through 2019. For our consolidated Affiliates, we were contingently liable for up to $21.7 million, and expected to make payments of $8.9 million ($1.6 million in 2017). The present value of these expected payments was $8.1 million. For our equity method Affiliates, we were contingently liable for up to $170.0 million, and expected to make no payments.Affiliate equity interests provide holders with a conditional right to put their interests to us over time. In addition, in connection with an investment in an Affiliate accounted for under the equity method, we entered into an arrangement with a minority owner of the Affiliate that gives such owner the right to sell a portion of its ownership interest in the Affiliate to us annually beginning in the fourth quarter of 2018. The purchase price of these conditional purchases will be at fair market value on the date of the transaction.We and certain of our Affiliates operate under regulatory authorities, which require that we and they maintain minimum financial or capital requirements. Share RepurchasesOur Board of Directors authorized share repurchase programs in May 2015 and January 2017, authorizing us to repurchase up to 3.0 million and 1.9 million shares of our common stock, respectively, for a total of 4.9 million shares, which do not expire. As of September 30, 2017, we had repurchased 2.6 million shares of this total authorized amount. In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017, we repurchased 0.4 million and 1.7 million shares, respectively, at an average price per share of $175.68 and $164.00, respectively. Contractual Obligations33The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of September 30, 2017. Contractual debt obligations include the cash payment of fixed interest.

Please refer to the below as well as the additional disclosures in Item 7A of our 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Foreign Currency Exchange RiskTo illustrate the effect of possible changes in currency exchange rates, we estimate a 1% change in the pound sterling and Canadian dollar to U.S. dollar exchange rates would have resulted in changes to stockholders’ equity of approximately $13 million and $2 million, respectively, as of September 30, 2017, and annual changes to Income before income taxes of $1.1 million and $0.3 million, respectively.Item 4.Controls and ProceduresWe carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures during the quarter covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the quarter covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective in ensuring that (i) the information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms, and (ii) such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, we recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and our management 34necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating and implementing possible controls and procedures. Our disclosure controls and procedures were designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their stated objectives, and our principal executive officer and principal financial officers concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. We review on an ongoing basis and document our disclosure controls and procedures, and our internal control over financial reporting, and we may from time to time make changes in an effort to enhance their effectiveness and ensure that our systems evolve with our business.No change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) occurred during the quarter covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.PART II—OTHER INFORMATIONItem 2.Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
