Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2013 10-K and other factors as discussed herein.Equity price, credit market and interest rate fluctuations can have a significant impact on our results of operations, primarily due to the effects they have on the asset management and other asset-based fees we earn, the “spread” income generated on our fixed annuities, fixed insurance, deposit products and the fixed portion of variable annuities and variable insurance contracts, the value of deferred acquisition costs (“DAC”) and deferred sales inducement costs (“DSIC”) assets, the values of liabilities for guaranteed benefits associated with our variable annuities and the values of derivatives held to hedge these benefits.Earnings, as well as operating earnings, will continue to be negatively impacted by the ongoing low interest rate environment. In addition to continuing spread compression in our interest sensitive product lines, a sustained low interest rate environment may result in increases to our reserves and changes in various rate assumptions we use to amortize DAC and DSIC, which may negatively impact our operating earnings. For additional discussion on our interest rate risk, see Item 3. “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.”We consolidate certain collateralized debt obligations (“CDOs”) and other investment products (collectively, “investment entities”) for which we provide asset management services to and sponsor for the investment of client assets in the normal course of business. These entities are defined as consolidated investment entities (“CIEs”). For further information on CIEs, see Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Changes in the valuation of the CIE assets and liabilities impact pretax income. The net income (loss) of the CIEs is reflected in net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests. The results of operations of the CIEs are reflected in the Corporate & Other segment. On a consolidated basis, the management fees we earn for the services we provide to the CIEs and the related general and administrative expenses are eliminated and the changes in the assets and liabilities related to the CIEs, primarily debt and underlying syndicated loans, are reflected in net investment income. We continue to include the fees in the management and financial advice fees line within our Asset Management segment.While our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), management believes that operating measures, which exclude net realized gains or losses; the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits, net of hedges and the related DSIC and DAC amortization; the market impact on indexed universal life benefits, net of hedges and the related DAC amortization, unearned revenue amortization and the reinsurance accrual; restructuring charges; income (loss) from discontinued operations; and the impact of consolidating CIEs, best reflect the underlying performance of our core operations and facilitate a more meaningful trend analysis. While the consolidation of the CIEs impacts our balance sheet 56AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. and income statement, our exposure to these entities is unchanged and there is no impact to the underlying business results. Management uses certain of these non-GAAP measures to evaluate our financial performance on a basis comparable to that used by some securities analysts and investors. Also, certain of these non-GAAP measures are taken into consideration, to varying degrees, for purposes of business planning and analysis and for certain compensation-related matters. Throughout our Management’s Discussion and Analysis, these non-GAAP measures are referred to as operating measures.It is management’s priority to increase shareholder value over a multi-year horizon by achieving our on-average, over-time financial targets.Our financial targets are:•Operating total net revenue growth of 6% to 8%,•Operating earnings per diluted share growth of 12% to 15%, and•Operating return on equity excluding accumulated other comprehensive income of 19% to 23%.The following tables reconcile our GAAP measures to operating measures: Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, 2014 2013 2014 2013 (in millions)Total net revenues$3,072 $2,749 $6,068 $5,440Less: Revenue attributable to CIEs160 12 337 94Less: Net realized gains1 — 6 1Less: Market impact on indexed universal life benefits(4) (1) (2) (1)Operating total net revenues$2,915 $2,738 $5,727 $5,346     Per Diluted Share Three Months Ended June 30, Three Months Ended June 30, 2014 2013 2014 2013 (in millions, except per share amounts)Net income$467 $281    Less: Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests93 (40)    Net income attributable to Ameriprise Financial374 321 $1.91 $1.54Less: Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax— (1) — —Net income from continuing operations attributable to Ameriprise Financial374 322 1.91 1.54Add: Restructuring charges, net of tax (1)— 1 — 0.01Add: Market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits, net of tax (1)35 28 0.18 0.13Add: Market impact on indexed universal life benefits, net of tax (1)— 1 — 0.01Less: Net realized gains, net of tax (1)1 — 0.01 —Operating earnings$408 $352 $2.08 $1.69        Weighted average common shares outstanding:       Basic192.7 204.9    Diluted196.2 208.6    (1) Calculated using the statutory tax rate of 35%.57AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC.

Critical Accounting PoliciesThe accounting and reporting policies that we use affect our Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of our accounting and reporting policies are critical to an understanding of our consolidated results of operations and financial condition and, in some cases, the application of these policies can be significantly affected by the estimates, judgments and assumptions made by management during the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements. These accounting policies are discussed in detail in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis — Critical Accounting Policies” in our 2013 10-K.Recent Accounting PronouncementsFor information regarding recent accounting pronouncements and their expected impact on our future consolidated results of operations and financial condition, see Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Assets Under Management and AdministrationAssets under management (“AUM”) include external client assets for which we provide investment management services, such as the assets of the Columbia funds and Threadneedle funds, assets of institutional clients and assets of clients in our advisor platform held in wrap accounts as well as assets managed by sub-advisers selected by us. AUM also includes certain assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets for which we provide investment management services and recognize management fees in our Asset Management segment, such as the assets of the general account and the variable product funds held in the separate accounts of our life insurance subsidiaries and client assets of CIEs. These assets do not include assets under advisement, for which we provide model portfolios but do not have full discretionary investment authority. Corporate & Other AUM primarily includes former bank assets that are managed within our Corporate & Other segment.Assets under administration (“AUA”) include assets for which we provide administrative services such as client assets invested in other companies’ products that we offer outside of our wrap accounts. These assets include those held in clients’ brokerage accounts. We generally record revenues received from administered assets as distribution fees. We do not exercise management discretion over these assets and do not earn a management fee. These assets are not reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. AUA also includes certain assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets for which we do not provide investment management services and do not recognize management fees, such as investments in non-affiliated funds held in the separate accounts of our life insurance subsidiaries. These assets do not include assets under advisement, for which we provide model portfolios but do not have full discretionary investment authority.The following table presents detail regarding our AUM and AUA: June 30,   2014 2013 ChangeAssets Under Management and Administration(in billions)  Advice & Wealth Management AUM$168.3 $136.3 $32.0 23 %Asset Management AUM518.3 459.4 58.9 13Corporate & Other AUM0.9 1.0 (0.1) (10)Eliminations(21.3) (19.0) (2.3) (12)Total Assets Under Management666.2 577.7 88.5 15Total Assets Under Administration143.7 125.5 18.2 15Total AUM and AUA$809.9 $703.2 $106.7 15 %Total AUM increased $88.5 billion, or 15%, to $666.2 billion as of June 30, 2014 compared to $577.7 billion as of June 30, 2013 due to a $32.0 billion increase in Advice & Wealth Management AUM driven by wrap account net inflows and market appreciation and a $58.9 billion increase in Asset Management AUM driven by market appreciation, partially offset by net outflows.

The market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits (net of hedges and the related DSIC and DAC amortization) was an expense of $54 million for the second quarter of 2014 compared to an expense of $43 million for the prior year period. The negative impact on earnings from spread compression in our interest sensitive product lines was approximately $11 million pretax for the three months ended June 30, 2014 compared to the prior year period. The impact on DAC and DSIC from actual versus expected market performance based on our view of bond and equity performance was a benefit of $16 million for the second quarter of 2014 compared to an expense of $12 million for the prior year period as a result of more favorable equity market returns and bond fund returns compared to the prior year period.60AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. Net RevenuesNet revenues increased $323 million, or 12%, to $3.1 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2014 compared to $2.7 billion for the prior year period primarily due to higher management and financial advice fees and other revenues.Management and financial advice fees increased $158 million, or 12%, to $1.5 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2014 compared to $1.3 billion for the prior year period primarily due to higher asset-based fees driven by an increase in average AUM. Average AUM increased $66.2 billion, or 11%, compared to the prior year period primarily due to market appreciation and wrap account net inflows, partially offset by asset management net outflows. See our discussion on the changes in AUM in our segment results of operations section below.Distribution fees increased $22 million, or 5%, to $470 million for the three months ended June 30, 2014 compared to $448 million for the prior year period due to higher client assets.Net investment income decreased $18 million, or 4%, to $433 million for the three months ended June 30, 2014 compared to $451 million for the prior year period primarily due to a $30 million gain on the sale of Threadneedle’s investment in Cofunds in the prior year period and a $28 million decrease in investment income on fixed maturities driven by low interest rates, partially offset by a $36 million increase in net investment income of CIEs.Premiums increased $30 million, or 10%, to $345 million for the three months ended June 30, 2014 compared to $315 million for the prior year period primarily due to growth in auto and home premiums driven by continued new policy sales growth, primarily from our affinity relationships with Costco and Progressive. Auto and home policy counts increased 12% compared to the prior year period.Other revenues increased $130 million, or 52%, to $379 million for the three months ended June 30, 2014 compared to $249 million for the prior year period due to a $112 million increase in other revenues of CIEs and higher fees from variable annuity guarantees driven by higher volumes due to prior year sales with a first fee collected on the anniversary date, as well as higher average fee rates. ExpensesTotal expenses increased $106 million, or 5%, to $2.5 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2014 compared to $2.3 billion for the prior year period primarily due to increases in distribution expenses and general and administrative expense.Distribution expenses increased $78 million, or 11%, to $810 million for the three months ended June 30, 2014 compared to $732 million for the prior year period driven by growth in assets under management. See our discussion on the changes in AUM in our segment results of operations section below.Interest credited to fixed accounts decreased $23 million, or 12%, to $175 million for the three months ended June 30, 2014 compared to $198 million for the prior year period driven by lower average fixed annuity account balances and a lower average crediting rate on interest sensitive fixed annuities. Average fixed annuities contract accumulation values decreased $836 million, or 6%, to $12.8 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2014 compared to the prior year period due to net outflows reflecting elevated surrenders on products sold through third parties where rates have been reset. The average fixed annuity crediting rate excluding capitalized interest decreased to 3.0% for the three months ended June 30, 2014 compared to 3.6% for the prior year period reflecting the re-pricing of the five-year guarantee block. See additional discussion on the re-pricing in the Annuities segment.Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses increased $16 million, or 3%, to $506 million for the three months ended June 30, 2014 compared to $490 million for the prior year period primarily reflecting the following items:•An increase in expenses related to our auto and home business driven by higher claim and claim adjustment expense reflecting the impact of growth in exposures due to a 9% increase in gross new policies and an increase in catastrophe losses due to severe weather. Catastrophe losses were $33 million for the three months ended June 30, 2014 compared to $18 million for the prior year period. •An increase in expenses of approximately $7 million related to higher reserve funding driven by the impact of higher fees from prior year sales with variable annuity guarantees.•A $12 million decrease in expenses from policyholder movement of investments in Portfolio Navigator funds under certain in-force variable annuities with living benefit guarantees to the Portfolio Stabilizer funds. See additional discussion in the Annuities segment.•A decrease in expense compared to the prior year period due to an $8 million increase in disability income reserves in the second quarter of 2013 related to prior periods.•A decrease in expense compared to the prior year period due to the impact on DSIC from actual versus expected market performance based on our view of bond and equity performance. This impact was a benefit of $3 million for the second 61AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. quarter of 2014 compared to an expense of $3 million for the prior year period as a result of more favorable equity market returns and bond fund returns compared to the prior year period.•A $41 million decrease in expense compared to the prior year period from the unhedged nonperformance credit spread risk adjustment on variable annuity guaranteed benefits.•A $54 million increase in expense from other market impacts on variable annuity guaranteed benefits, net of hedges in place to offset those risks and the related DSIC amortization. The $54 million increase was the result of an unfavorable $426 million change in the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits reserves, a favorable $370 million change in the market impact on derivatives hedging the variable annuity guaranteed benefits and a favorable $2 million DSIC offset. The main market drivers contributing to these changes are summarized below:•Interest rates were down in 2014 and up in 2013 resulting in an unfavorable change in the variable annuity guaranteed living benefits liability, partially offset by a favorable change in the related hedge assets. •Equity market and volatility impacts on the variable annuity guaranteed living benefits liability resulted in a decrease in expense in 2014 compared to an increase in expense in 2013. This benefit was partially offset by an unfavorable change in 2014 compared to 2013 from equity market and volatility impacts on the related hedge assets. •Other unhedged items, including the difference between the assumed and actual underlying separate account investment performance, fixed income credit exposures, transaction costs and various behavioral items, were a net favorable impact compared to the prior year period.Amortization of DAC decreased $14 million, or 15%, to $78 million for the three months ended June 30, 2014 compared to $92 million for the prior year period primarily reflecting the impact on DAC from actual versus expected market performance based on our view of bond and equity performance. This impact was a benefit of $13 million for the second quarter of 2014 compared to an expense of $9 million for the prior year period as a result of more favorable equity market returns and bond fund returns compared to the prior year period.Interest and debt expense increased $19 million, or 32%, to $79 million for the three months ended June 30, 2014 compared to $60 million for the prior year period primarily due to a $10 million increase in interest and debt expense of CIEs, as well as expenses related to the early redemption of our senior notes due 2039 in the second quarter of 2014 and higher average outstanding debt balances.General and administrative expenses increased $30 million, or 4%, to $805 million for the three months ended June 30, 2014 compared to $775 million for the prior year period primarily due to provisions for regulatory reserves in the second quarter of 2014, higher performance driven compensation accruals, a $5 million increase in general and administrative expenses of CIEs and investments in the business.Income TaxesOur effective tax rate on income from continuing operations including income attributable to noncontrolling interests was 24.5% for the three months ended June 30, 2014 compared to 29.6% for the prior year period. Our effective tax rate on income from continuing operations excluding income attributable to noncontrolling interests was 28.7% for the three months ended June 30, 2014 compared to 26.9% for the prior year period. The effective tax rate for the three months ended June 30, 2014 was lower than the statutory rate as a result of tax preferred items including the dividends received deduction and low income housing tax credits. 62AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. Results of Operations by Segment for the Three Months Ended June 30, 2014 and 2013 Operating earnings is the measure of segment profit or loss management uses to evaluate segment performance. Operating earnings should not be viewed as a substitute for GAAP income from continuing operations before income tax provision. We believe the presentation of segment operating earnings as we measure it for management purposes enhances the understanding of our business by reflecting the underlying performance of our core operations and facilitating a more meaningful trend analysis. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the presentation of segment results and our definition of operating earnings.The following table presents summary financial information by segment: Three Months Ended June 30, 2014 2013 (in millions)Advice & Wealth Management   Net revenues$1,198 $1,076Expenses1,004 926Operating earnings$194 $150Asset Management   Net revenues$844 $822Expenses645 628Operating earnings$199 $194Annuities   Net revenues$651 $635Expenses481 525Operating earnings$170 $110Protection   Net revenues$579 $550Expenses488 459Operating earnings$91 $91Corporate & Other   Net revenues$(2) $3Expenses73 60Operating loss$(75) $(57)Advice & Wealth ManagementOur Advice & Wealth Management segment provides financial planning and advice, as well as full-service brokerage services, primarily to retail clients through our advisors. These services are centered on long-term, personal relationships between our advisors and our clients and focus on helping clients confidently achieve their financial goals. Our advisors provide a distinctive approach to financial planning and have access to a broad selection of both affiliated and non-affiliated products to help clients meet their financial needs. A significant portion of revenues in this segment is fee-based, driven by the level of client assets, which is impacted by both market movements and net asset flows. We also earn net investment income on invested assets primarily from certificate products. This segment earns revenues (distribution fees) for distributing non-affiliated products and intersegment revenues (distribution fees) for distributing our affiliated products and services to our retail clients. Intersegment expenses for this segment include expenses for investment management services provided by the Asset Management segment.In addition to purchases of affiliated and non-affiliated mutual funds and other securities on a stand-alone basis, clients may purchase mutual funds, among other securities, in connection with investment advisory fee-based “wrap account” programs or services, and pay fees based on a percentage of their assets.63AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC.

Columbia Management primarily provides products and services in the U.S. and Threadneedle primarily provides products and services internationally. We provide clients with U.S. domestic individual products through unaffiliated third party financial institutions and through our Advice & Wealth Management segment, and we provide institutional products and services through our institutional sales force. International retail products are primarily distributed through third-party financial institutions and unaffiliated financial advisors. Individual products include U.S. mutual funds and non-U.S. equivalents, exchange-traded funds and variable product funds underlying insurance and annuity separate accounts. Institutional asset management services are designed to meet specific client objectives and may involve a range of products, including those that focus on traditional asset classes, separately managed accounts, individually managed accounts, collateralized loan obligations, hedge funds, collective funds and property funds. Collateralized loan obligations, hedge funds and certain private funds are often classified as alternative assets. Revenues in this segment are primarily earned as fees based on managed asset balances, which are impacted by market movements, net asset flows, asset allocation and product mix. We may also earn performance fees from certain accounts where investment performance meets or exceeds certain pre-identified targets. Our Asset Management segment also provides intercompany asset management services for Ameriprise Financial subsidiaries. The fees for such services are reflected within the Asset Management segment results through intersegment transfer pricing. Intersegment expenses for this segment include distribution expenses for services provided by our Advice & Wealth Management, Annuities and Protection segments.From time to time, fee waivers have been provided to the Columbia Money Market Funds (the “Funds”) by Columbia Management and certain other subsidiaries performing services for the Funds for the purposes of reducing the expenses charged to a Fund in a given period to maintain or improve a Fund’s net yield in that period. Our subsidiaries may enter into contractual arrangements with the Funds identifying the specific fees to be waived and/or expenses to be reimbursed, as well as the time period for which such waivers will apply. In aggregate, we voluntarily waived fees of $3 million for both the three months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013.65AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC.

Mutual fund performance rankings are based on the performance of Class Z fund shares for Columbia branded mutual funds. Only funds with Class Z shares are included. In instances where a fund’s Class Z shares do not have a full five year track record, performance for an older share class of the same fund, typically Class A shares, is utilized for the period before Class Z shares were launched. No adjustments to the historical track records are made to account for differences in fund expenses between share classes of a fund.Equal Weighted Rankings in Top 2 Quartiles: Counts the number of funds with above median ranking divided by the total number of funds. Asset size is not a factor.Asset Weighted Rankings in Top 2 Quartiles: Sums the total assets of the funds with above median ranking (using Class Z and appended Class Z) divided by total assets of all funds.

Total segment AUM net inflows were $4.4 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2014 primarily due to a previously announced $5.6 billion mandate from a new client. Management expects, consistent with prior patterns of outflows, that outflows of primarily low margin assets directly or indirectly affiliated with Threadneedle and Columbia former parent companies will continue for the foreseeable future. The overall impact to segment results is difficult to quantify due to uncertain timing, volume and mix of the outflows. Columbia managed assets increased $5.6 billion, or 2%, during the three months ended June 30, 2014 primarily due to market appreciation. Columbia retail funds increased $4.3 billion, or 2%, during the three months ended June 30, 2014 primarily due to market appreciation and net inflows, partially offset by distributions. Columbia retail net inflows of $0.7 billion during the second quarter of 2014 included $3.5 billion of reinvested dividends some of which related to normal seasonal increases from funds underlying our variable annuity products, partially offset by $2.8 billion of net new outflows which included $1.0 billion of outflows in the defined contribution/investment only channel, $0.3 billion of outflows from a former parent affiliated distribution relationship, $0.4 billion of outflows in the Registered Investment Advisor (“RIA”) channel and $0.2 billion of outflows of a third party sub-advisor. Columbia institutional AUM increased $1.1 billion, or 1%, during the three months ended June 30, 2014 due to market appreciation, partially offset by net outflows of $0.8 billion primarily reflecting outflows from former parent affiliated distribution and former parent influenced mandates, partially offset by third party institutional inflows. 70AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. Threadneedle managed assets increased $8.8 billion, or 6%, during the three months ended June 30, 2014 due to net inflows and a positive impact of foreign currency translation. Threadneedle retail funds increased $1.4 billion, or 3%, during the three months ended June 30, 2014 primarily due to a positive impact of foreign currency translation. Threadneedle retail net flows were nil as strong underlying net inflows were offset by approximately $1.5 billion of outflows from the U.S. equities product where we had a portfolio manager change earlier in the year. Threadneedle institutional AUM increased $7.5 billion, or 8%, during the three months ended June 30, 2014 primarily due to net inflows and a positive impact of foreign currency translation. Threadneedle institutional net inflows of $4.3 billion during the second quarter of 2014 included a $5.6 billion mandate from a leading UK wealth management firm to manage assets in a Strategic Managed fund, which holds a combination of global and UK domestic equities and bonds, partially offset by $0.7 billion of outflows from legacy insurance assets and $0.4 billion of one-time outflows from corporate Liverpool Victoria assets.

Net RevenuesNet revenues, which exclude net realized gains or losses, increased $22 million, or 3%, to $844 million for the three months ended June 30, 2014 compared to $822 million for the prior year period driven by an increase in management and financial advice fees, partially offset by a decrease in net investment income.Management and financial advice fees increased $45 million, or 7%, to $707 million for the three months ended June 30, 2014 compared to $662 million for the prior year period primarily due to an increase in assets under management. Average assets under management increased 9% compared to the prior year period driven by equity market appreciation, partially offset by net outflows. See our discussion above on the changes in assets under management.Net investment income decreased $28 million, or 68%, to $13 million for the three months ended June 30, 2014 compared to $41 million for the prior year period due to a $30 million gain on the sale of Threadneedle’s investment in Cofunds in the prior year period.ExpensesTotal expenses increased $17 million, or 3%, to $645 million for the three months ended June 30, 2014 compared to $628 million for the prior year period primarily due to a $10 million increase in distribution expenses driven by higher retail fund assets.  71AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. AnnuitiesOur Annuities segment provides variable and fixed annuity products of RiverSource Life companies to individual clients. We provide our variable annuity products through our advisors, and our fixed annuity products are distributed through both affiliated and unaffiliated advisors and financial institutions. Revenues for our variable annuity products are primarily earned as fees based on underlying account balances, which are impacted by both market movements and net asset flows. Revenues for our fixed annuity products are primarily earned as net investment income on assets supporting fixed account balances, with profitability significantly impacted by the spread between net investment income earned and interest credited on the fixed account balances. We also earn net investment income on owned assets supporting reserves for immediate annuities and for certain guaranteed benefits offered with variable annuities and on capital supporting the business. Intersegment revenues for this segment reflect fees paid by our Asset Management segment for marketing support and other services provided in connection with the availability of variable insurance trust funds (“VIT Funds”) under the variable annuity contracts. Intersegment expenses for this segment include distribution expenses for services provided by our Advice & Wealth Management segment, as well as expenses for investment management services provided by our Asset Management segment.The following table presents the results of operations of our Annuities segment on an operating basis: Three Months Ended June 30,     2014 2013 Change (in millions)  Revenues       Management and financial advice fees$189 $174 $15 9 %Distribution fees91 85 6 7Net investment income234 260 (26) (10)Premiums32 26 6 23Other revenues105 90 15 17Total revenues651 635 16 3Banking and deposit interest expense— — — —Total net revenues651 635 16 3Expenses       Distribution expenses109 106 3 3Interest credited to fixed accounts139 162 (23) (14)Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses113 130 (17) (13)Amortization of deferred acquisition costs51 66 (15) (23)Interest and debt expense9 8 1 13General and administrative expense60 53 7 13Total expenses481 525 (44) (8)Operating earnings$170 $110 $60 55 %Our Annuities segment pretax operating income, which excludes net realized gains or losses and the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits (net of hedges and the related DSIC and DAC amortization), increased $60 million, or 55%, to $170 million for the three months ended June 30, 2014 compared to $110 million for the prior year period primarily due to market appreciation and a benefit from policyholder movement of investments in Portfolio Navigator funds under certain in-force variable annuities with living benefit guarantees to the Portfolio Stabilizer funds. In addition, the impact on DAC and DSIC from actual versus expected market performance based on our view of bond and equity performance was a benefit of $15 million for the second quarter of 2014 compared to an expense of $12 million for the prior year period as a result of more favorable equity market returns and bond fund returns compared to the prior year period.During the fourth quarter of 2013, we added Portfolio Stabilizer fund options for our in-force variable annuities with living benefit guarantees. We continue to see existing policyholders moving to Portfolio Stabilizer funds at a level higher than anticipated. In the second quarter of 2014, approximately $1.5 billion of account value was moved into the funds. The resulting earnings benefit in the second quarter of 2014 was $10 million.RiverSource variable annuity account balances increased 10% to $77.6 billion at June 30, 2014 compared to the prior year period due to market appreciation, partially offset by net outflows of $1.3 billion. RiverSource fixed annuity account balances declined 7% to $12.6 billion at June 30, 2014 compared to the prior year period reflecting elevated surrenders on products sold through third parties where rates have been reset. This decline is offset by the change in crediting rates, which decreased the level of spread 72AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. compression in the second quarter of 2014. Approximately $3.7 billion of the five-year guarantee block has been re-priced and approximately $0.4 billion will be re-priced in the balance of the year.Net RevenuesNet revenues, which exclude net realized gains or losses, increased $16 million, or 3%, to $651 million for the three months ended June 30, 2014 compared to $635 million for the prior year period primarily due to higher management and financial advice fees and other revenues, partially offset by a decrease in net investment income.Management and financial advice fees increased $15 million, or 9%, to $189 million for the three months ended June 30, 2014 compared to $174 million for the prior year period due to higher fees on variable annuities driven by higher separate account balances. Average variable annuities contract accumulation values increased $4.9 billion, or 7%, compared to the prior year period due to market appreciation, partially offset by net outflows.Distribution fees increased $6 million, or 7%, to $91 million for the three months ended June 30, 2014 compared to $85 million for the prior year period due to higher fees on variable annuities driven by higher separate account balances.Net investment income, which excludes net realized gains or losses, decreased $26 million, or 10%, to $234 million for the three months ended June 30, 2014 compared to $260 million for the prior year period primarily reflecting a decrease of approximately $8 million from lower invested assets due to fixed annuity net outflows and approximately $20 million from lower interest rates.Premiums increased $6 million, or 23%, to $32 million for the three months ended June 30, 2014 compared to $26 million for the prior year period primarily due to higher sales of immediate annuities with life contingencies.Other revenues increased $15 million, or 17%, to $105 million for the three months ended June 30, 2014 compared to $90 million for the prior year period due to higher fees from variable annuity guarantees driven by higher volumes due to prior year sales with a first fee collected on the anniversary date, as well as higher average fee rates.ExpensesTotal expenses, which exclude the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits (net of hedges and the related DSIC and DAC amortization) decreased $44 million, or 8%, to $481 million for the three months ended June 30, 2014 compared to $525 million for the prior year period due to decreases in interest credited to fixed accounts, benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses and amortization of DAC. Interest credited to fixed accounts decreased $23 million, or 14%, to $139 million for the three months ended June 30, 2014 compared to $162 million for the prior year period driven by lower average fixed annuity account balances and a lower average crediting rate on interest sensitive fixed annuities. Average fixed annuities contract accumulation values decreased $836 million, or 6%, to $12.8 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2014 compared to the prior year period due to net outflows reflecting elevated surrenders on products sold through third parties where rates have been reset. The average fixed annuity crediting rate excluding capitalized interest decreased to 3.0% for the three months ended June 30, 2014 compared to 3.6% for the prior year period reflecting the re-pricing of the five-year guarantee block. Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses, which exclude the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits (net of hedges and the related DSIC amortization), decreased $17 million, or 13%, to $113 million for the three months ended June 30, 2014 compared to $130 million for the prior year period primarily due to a $12 million benefit from policyholder movement of investments in Portfolio Navigator funds under certain in-force variable annuities with living benefit guarantees to the Portfolio Stabilizer funds and a decrease in expense due to the impact on DSIC from actual versus expected market performance based on our view of bond and equity performance, partially offset by an increase in expense of $7 million related to higher reserve funding driven by the impact of higher fees from prior year sales with variable annuity guarantees. The impact on DSIC from actual versus expected market performance based on our view of bond and equity performance was a benefit of $3 million for the second quarter of 2014 compared to an expense of $3 million for the prior year period as a result of more favorable equity market returns and bond fund returns compared to the prior year period.Amortization of DAC, which excludes the DAC offset to the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits, decreased $15 million, or 23%, to $51 million for the three months ended June 30, 2014 compared to $66 million for the prior year period primarily reflecting the impact on DAC from actual versus expected market performance based on our view of bond and equity performance. This impact was a benefit of $12 million for the second quarter of 2014 compared to an expense of $9 million for the prior year period as a result of more favorable equity market returns and bond fund returns compared to the prior year period. 73AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. ProtectionOur Protection segment offers a variety of products to address the protection and risk management needs of our retail clients including life, disability income and property-casualty insurance. Life and disability income products are primarily provided through our advisors. Our property-casualty products are sold primarily through affinity relationships. We issue insurance policies through our life insurance subsidiaries and the Property Casualty companies. The primary sources of revenues for this segment are premiums, fees and charges we receive to assume insurance-related risk. We earn net investment income on owned assets supporting insurance reserves and capital supporting the business. We also receive fees based on the level of assets supporting variable universal life (“VUL”) separate account balances. This segment earns intersegment revenues from fees paid by our Asset Management segment for marketing support and other services provided in connection with the availability of VIT Funds under the VUL contracts. Intersegment expenses for this segment include distribution expenses for services provided by our Advice & Wealth Management segment, as well as expenses for investment management services provided by our Asset Management segment.The following table presents the results of operations of our Protection segment on an operating basis: Three Months Ended June 30,     2014 2013 Change (in millions)  Revenues       Management and financial advice fees$15 $14 $1 7 %Distribution fees22 23 (1) (4)Net investment income113 111 2 2Premiums317 293 24 8Other revenues112 109 3 3Total revenues579 550 29 5Banking and deposit interest expense— — — —Total net revenues579 550 29 5Expenses       Distribution expenses16 16 — —Interest credited to fixed accounts37 34 3 9Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses329 309 20 6Amortization of deferred acquisition costs36 31 5 16Interest and debt expense7 6 1 17General and administrative expense63 63 — —Total expenses488 459 29 6Operating earnings$91 $91 $— — %NM Not Meaningful.Our Protection segment pretax operating income, which excludes net realized gains or losses and the market impact on indexed universal life benefits (net of hedges and the related DAC amortization, unearned revenue amortization and the reinsurance accrual), remained flat at $91 million for the three months ended June 30, 2014 compared to the prior year period. Net RevenuesNet revenues, which exclude net realized gains or losses and the unearned revenue amortization and the reinsurance accrual offset to the market impact on indexed universal life benefits, increased $29 million, or 5%, to $579 million for the three months ended June 30, 2014 compared to $550 million for the prior year period due to growth in auto and home premiums.Premiums increased $24 million, or 8%, to $317 million for the three months ended June 30, 2014 compared to $293 million for the prior year period primarily due to growth in auto and home premiums driven by continued new policy sales growth, primarily from our affinity relationships with Costco and Progressive. Auto and home policy counts increased 12% compared to the prior year period.74AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. ExpensesTotal expenses, which exclude the market impact on indexed universal life benefits (net of hedges and the related DAC amortization), increased $29 million, or 6%, to $488 million for the three months ended June 30, 2014 compared to $459 million for the prior year period primarily due to higher expenses related to our auto and home business.Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses increased $20 million, or 6%, to $329 million for the three months ended June 30, 2014 compared to $309 million for the prior year period due to higher auto and home claim and claim adjustment expense, partially offset by an $8 million increase in disability income reserves in the second quarter of 2013 related to prior periods. The increase in auto and home claim and claim adjustment expense reflected the impact of growth in exposures due to a 9% increase in gross new policies and an increase in catastrophe losses due to severe weather. Catastrophe losses were $33 million for the three months ended June 30, 2014 compared to $18 million for the prior year period. Corporate & OtherOur Corporate & Other segment consists of net investment income or loss on corporate level assets, including excess capital held in our subsidiaries and other unallocated equity and other revenues as well as unallocated corporate expenses.

Our Corporate & Other segment results for the second quarter of 2014 included higher expenses primarily related to the early redemption of our senior notes due 2039, provision for potential resolution of a regulatory matter regarding certain historical events and processes at one of our ongoing lines of business which we believe have since been remediated, and long-term performance compensation awards. 75AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC.

The market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits (net of hedges and the related DSIC and DAC amortization) was an expense of $69 million for the six months ended June 30, 2014, which included a $2 million expense associated with policyholder movement of investments in Portfolio Navigator funds under certain in-force variable annuities with living benefit guarantees to the Portfolio Stabilizer funds, compared to an expense of $45 million for the prior year period. The negative impact on earnings from spread compression in our interest sensitive product lines was approximately $29 million pretax for the six months ended June 30, 2014 compared to the prior year period. The impact on DAC and DSIC from actual versus expected market performance based on our view of bond and equity performance was a benefit of $24 million for the six months ended June 30, 2014 compared to a benefit of $3 million for the prior year period as a result of more favorable bond fund returns compared to the prior year period.    76AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. Net RevenuesNet revenues increased $628 million, or 12%, to $6.1 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2014 compared to $5.4 billion for the prior year period primarily due to higher management and financial advice fees, distribution fees and other revenues.Management and financial advice fees increased $300 million, or 12%, to $2.8 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2014 compared to $2.5 billion for the prior year period primarily due to higher asset-based fees driven by an increase in average AUM. Average AUM increased $65.8 billion, or 11%, compared to the prior year period primarily due to market appreciation and wrap account net inflows, partially offset by asset management net outflows. See our discussion on the changes in AUM in our segment results of operations section below. Distribution fees increased $64 million, or 7%, to $946 million for the six months ended June 30, 2014 compared to $882 million for the prior year period due to higher client assets and increased client activity.Net investment income decreased $36 million, or 4%, to $904 million for the six months ended June 30, 2014 compared to $940 million for the prior year period primarily due to a $30 million gain on the sale of Threadneedle’s investment in Cofunds in the prior year period and a $55 million decrease in investment income on fixed maturities driven by low interest rates, partially offset by a $33 million increase in net investment income of CIEs.Premiums increased $50 million, or 8%, to $675 million for the six months ended June 30, 2014 compared to $625 million for the prior year period primarily due to growth in auto and home premiums driven by continued new policy sales growth, primarily from our affinity relationships with Costco and Progressive. Auto and home policy counts increased 12% compared to the prior year period.Other revenues increased $248 million, or 53%, to $719 million for the six months ended June 30, 2014 compared to $471 million for the prior year period due to a $212 million increase in other revenues of CIEs and higher fees from variable annuity guarantees driven by higher volumes due to prior year sales with a first fee collected on the anniversary date, as well as higher average fee rates. ExpensesTotal expenses increased $248 million, or 5%, to $4.8 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2014 compared to $4.6 billion for the prior year period primarily due to increases in distribution expenses and benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses.Distribution expenses increased $166 million, or 12%, to $1.6 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2014 compared to $1.4 billion for the prior year period driven by growth in assets under management. See our discussion on the changes in AUM in our segment results of operations section below.Interest credited to fixed accounts decreased $35 million, or 9%, to $361 million for the six months ended June 30, 2014 compared to $396 million for the prior year period driven by lower average fixed annuity account balances and a lower average crediting rate on interest sensitive fixed annuities. Average fixed annuities contract accumulation values decreased $748 million, or 5%, to $12.9 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2014 compared to the prior year period due to net outflows reflecting elevated surrenders on products sold through third parties where rates have been reset. The average fixed annuity crediting rate excluding capitalized interest decreased to 3.2% for the six months ended June 30, 2014 compared to 3.6% for the prior year period reflecting the re-pricing of the five-year guarantee block. See additional discussion on the re-pricing in the Annuities segment.Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses increased $57 million, or 6%, to $956 million for the six months ended June 30, 2014 compared to $899 million for the prior year period primarily reflecting the following items:•An increase in expenses related to our auto and home business driven by higher claim and claim adjustment expense reflecting the impact of growth in exposures due to an 11% increase in gross new policies, an increase in catastrophe losses due to severe weather and a $30 million increase in auto liability reserves in the first quarter of 2014 based upon additional analysis and information regarding continued adverse development of bodily injury claims associated with prior accident years. Catastrophe losses were $42 million for the six months ended June 30, 2014 compared to $20 million for the prior year period. •An increase in expenses of approximately $16 million related to higher reserve funding driven by the impact of higher fees from prior year sales with variable annuity guarantees.•A $44 million decrease in expenses from policyholder movement of investments in Portfolio Navigator funds under certain in-force variable annuities with living benefit guarantees to the Portfolio Stabilizer funds, which included a $2 million expense related to the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits. See additional discussion in the Annuities segment.•A decrease in expense compared to the prior year period due to an $8 million increase in disability income reserves in the second quarter of 2013 related to prior periods.77AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. •A decrease in expense compared to the prior year period due to the impact on DSIC from actual versus expected market performance based on our view of bond and equity performance. This impact was a benefit of $5 million for the first half of 2014 compared to nil for the prior year period as a result of more favorable bond fund returns compared to the prior year period.•A $150 million decrease in expense compared to the prior year period from the unhedged nonperformance credit spread risk adjustment on variable annuity guaranteed benefits.•A $177 million increase in expense from other market impacts on variable annuity guaranteed benefits, net of hedges in place to offset those risks and the related DSIC amortization. The $177 million increase was the result of an unfavorable $1.2 billion change in the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits reserves, a favorable $1.1 billion change in the market impact on derivatives hedging the variable annuity guaranteed benefits and a favorable $3 million DSIC offset. The main market drivers contributing to these changes are summarized below:•Interest rates were down in 2014 and up in 2013 resulting in an unfavorable change in the variable annuity guaranteed living benefits liability, partially offset by a favorable change in the related hedge assets. •Equity market and volatility impacts on the variable annuity guaranteed living benefits liability resulted in a larger decrease in expense in 2014 compared to 2013. This benefit was partially offset by an unfavorable change in 2014 compared to 2013 from equity market and volatility impacts on the related hedge assets.•Other unhedged items, including the difference between the assumed and actual underlying separate account investment performance, fixed income credit exposures, transaction costs and various behavioral items, were a net favorable impact compared to the prior year period.Interest and debt expense increased $32 million, or 25%, to $158 million for the six months ended June 30, 2014 compared to $126 million for the prior year period primarily due to a $19 million increase in interest and debt expense of CIEs, as well as expenses related to the early redemption of our senior notes due 2039 in the second quarter of 2014 and higher average outstanding debt balances.General and administrative expenses increased $30 million, or 2%, to $1.6 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2014 compared to $1.5 billion for the prior year period primarily due to provisions for regulatory reserves in the second quarter of 2014, higher performance driven compensation accruals, a $6 million increase in general and administrative expenses of CIEs and investments in the business.Income TaxesOur effective tax rate on income from continuing operations including income attributable to noncontrolling interests was 22.5% for the six months ended June 30, 2014 compared to 27.1% for the prior year period. Our effective tax rate on income from continuing operations excluding income attributable to noncontrolling interests was 26.9% for the six months ended June 30, 2014 compared to 26.8% for the prior year period. The effective tax rate for the six months ended June 30, 2014 was lower than the statutory rate as a result of tax preferred items including the dividends received deduction and low income housing tax credits, as well as a $17 million benefit in the first quarter of 2014 related to the completion of an Internal Revenue Service audit. 78AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. Results of Operations by Segment for the Six Months Ended June 30, 2014 and 2013 Operating earnings is the measure of segment profit or loss management uses to evaluate segment performance.

Total segment AUM net inflows were $0.5 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2014. Management expects, consistent with prior patterns of outflows, that outflows of primarily low margin assets directly or indirectly affiliated with Threadneedle and Columbia former parent companies will continue for the foreseeable future. The overall impact to segment results is difficult to quantify due to uncertain timing, volume and mix of the outflows. Columbia managed assets increased $6.8 billion, or 2%, during the six months ended June 30, 2014 primarily due to market appreciation, partially offset by net outflows. Total Columbia net outflows were $2.5 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2014. Columbia retail funds increased $4.4 billion, or 2%, during the six months ended June 30, 2014 primarily due to market appreciation, partially offset by net outflows and distributions. Columbia retail net outflows of $1.9 billion during the first half of 2014 included $5.7 billion of net new outflows, partially offset by $3.8 billion of reinvested dividends some of which was related to normal seasonal increases in the second quarter from funds underlying our variable annuity products. Columbia retail net new outflows for the six months ended June 30, 2014 included $2.0 billion of outflows in the defined contribution/investment only channel, $0.7 billion of outflows from a former parent affiliated distribution relationship, $0.7 billion of outflows in the RIA channel and $0.4 billion of outflows from a third party sub-advisor. Columbia institutional AUM increased $2.0 billion, or 3%, during the six months ended June 30, 2014 due to market appreciation, partially offset by net outflows of $1.2 billion primarily reflecting 83AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. outflows from former parent affiliated distribution and former parent influenced mandates, partially offset by third party institutional inflows. Threadneedle managed assets increased $10.7 billion, or 7%, during the six months ended June 30, 2014 due to net inflows, market appreciation and a positive impact of foreign currency translation. Threadneedle retail funds increased $1.5 billion, or 3%, during the six months ended June 30, 2014 primarily due to a positive impact of foreign currency translation and market appreciation, partially offset by net outflows. Threadneedle retail net outflows were $0.9 billion as strong underlying net inflows were offset by approximately $3.6 billion of outflows from the U.S. equities product where we had a portfolio manager change earlier in the year. Threadneedle institutional AUM increased $9.2 billion, or 10%, during the six months ended June 30, 2014 primarily due to net inflows and a positive impact of foreign currency translation. Threadneedle institutional net inflows of $4.0 billion during the first half of 2014 included a $5.6 billion mandate from a leading UK wealth management firm to manage assets in a Strategic Managed fund, partially offset by $1.8 billion of outflows from legacy insurance assets and $0.4 billion of one-time outflows from corporate Liverpool Victoria assets in the second quarter.

Net RevenuesNet revenues, which exclude net realized gains or losses, increased $83 million, or 5%, to $1.7 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2014 compared to $1.6 billion for the prior year period driven by an increase in management and financial advice fees, partially offset by a decrease in net investment income.Management and financial advice fees increased $98 million, or 8%, to $1.4 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2014 compared to $1.3 billion for the prior year period primarily due to an increase in assets under management. Average assets under management increased 9% compared to the prior year period driven by equity market appreciation, partially offset by net outflows. See our discussion above on the changes in assets under management.Net investment income decreased $28 million, or 62%, to $17 million for the six months ended June 30, 2014 compared to $45 million for the prior year period due to a $30 million gain on the sale of Threadneedle’s investment in Cofunds in the prior year period.ExpensesTotal expenses increased $33 million, or 3%, to $1.3 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2014 compared to $1.2 billion for the prior year period primarily due to a $26 million increase in distribution expenses driven by higher retail fund assets. 84AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC.

In addition, the impact on DAC and DSIC from actual versus expected market performance based on our view of bond and equity performance was a benefit of $23 million for the six months ended June 30, 2014 compared to a benefit of $2 million for the prior year period as a result of more favorable bond fund returns compared to the prior year period.During the fourth quarter of 2013, we added Portfolio Stabilizer fund options for our in-force variable annuities with living benefit guarantees. We continue to see existing policyholders moving to Portfolio Stabilizer funds at a level higher than anticipated. In the first half of 2014, approximately $3.3 billion of account value was moved into the funds. The resulting earnings benefit for the six months ended June 30, 2014 was $39 million.RiverSource variable annuity account balances increased 10% to $77.6 billion at June 30, 2014 compared to the prior year period due to market appreciation, partially offset by net outflows of $1.3 billion. RiverSource fixed annuity account balances declined 7% to $12.6 billion at June 30, 2014 compared to the prior year period reflecting elevated surrenders on products sold through third parties where rates have been reset. This decline is offset by the change in crediting rates, which decreased the level of spread compression in the first half of 2014. Approximately $3.7 billion of the five-year guarantee block has been re-priced and approximately $0.4 billion will be re-priced in the balance of the year.Net RevenuesNet revenues, which exclude net realized gains or losses, increased $28 million, or 2%, to $1.3 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2014 compared to $1.3 billion for the prior year period primarily due to higher management and financial advice fees, distribution fees and other revenues, partially offset by a decrease in net investment income.Management and financial advice fees increased $28 million, or 8%, to $372 million for the six months ended June 30, 2014 compared to $344 million for the prior year period due to higher fees on variable annuities driven by higher separate account balances. Average variable annuities contract accumulation values increased $5.1 billion, or 8%, compared to the prior year period due to market appreciation, partially offset by net outflows.85AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. Distribution fees increased $13 million, or 8%, to $179 million for the six months ended June 30, 2014 compared to $166 million for the prior year period due to higher fees on variable annuities driven by higher separate account balances.Net investment income, which excludes net realized gains or losses, decreased $48 million, or 9%, to $476 million for the six months ended June 30, 2014 compared to $524 million for the prior year period primarily reflecting a decrease of approximately $11 million from lower invested assets due to fixed annuity net outflows and approximately $40 million from lower interest rates.Other revenues increased $31 million, or 18%, to $202 million for the six months ended June 30, 2014 compared to $171 million for the prior year period due to higher fees from variable annuity guarantees driven by higher volumes due to prior year sales with a first fee collected on the anniversary date, as well as higher average fee rates.ExpensesTotal expenses, which exclude the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits (net of hedges and the related DSIC and DAC amortization) decreased $66 million, or 7%, to $941 million for the six months ended June 30, 2014 compared to $1.0 billion for the prior year period due to decreases in interest credited to fixed accounts and benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses. Distribution expenses increased $13 million, or 6%, to $216 million for the six months ended June 30, 2014 compared to $203 million for the prior year period primarily due to higher variable annuity compensation driven by higher variable annuity contract values.Interest credited to fixed accounts decreased $39 million, or 12%, to $287 million for the six months ended June 30, 2014 compared to $326 million for the prior year period driven by lower average fixed annuity account balances and a lower average crediting rate on interest sensitive fixed annuities. Average fixed annuities contract accumulation values decreased $748 million, or 5%, to $12.9 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2014 compared to the prior year period due to net outflows reflecting elevated surrenders on products sold through third parties where rates have been reset. The average fixed annuity crediting rate excluding capitalized interest decreased to 3.2% for the six months ended June 30, 2014 compared to 3.6% for the prior year period reflecting the re-pricing of the five-year guarantee block.Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses, which exclude the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits (net of hedges and the related DSIC amortization), decreased $47 million, or 19%, to $199 million for the six months ended June 30, 2014 compared to $246 million for the prior year period primarily due to a $46 million benefit from policyholder movement of investments in Portfolio Navigator funds under certain in-force variable annuities with living benefit guarantees to the Portfolio Stabilizer funds and a decrease in expense due to the impact on DSIC from actual versus expected market performance based on our view of bond and equity performance, partially offset by an increase in expense of $16 million related to higher reserve funding driven by the impact of higher fees from prior year sales with variable annuity guarantees. The impact on DSIC from actual versus expected market performance based on our view of bond and equity performance was a benefit of $5 million for the first half of 2014 compared to nil for the prior year period as a result of more favorable bond fund returns compared to the prior year period. 86AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC.

Auto and home policy counts increased 12% compared to the prior year period.ExpensesTotal expenses, which exclude the market impact on indexed universal life benefits (net of hedges and the related DAC amortization), increased $91 million, or 10%, to $984 million for the six months ended June 30, 2014 compared to $893 million for the prior year period primarily due to higher expenses related to our auto and home business.Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses increased $77 million, or 13%, to $678 million for the six months ended June 30, 2014 compared to $601 million for the prior year period due to higher auto and home claim and claim adjustment expense, partially offset by an $8 million increase in disability income reserves in the second quarter of 2013 related to prior periods. The increase in auto and home claim and claim adjustment expense reflected the impact of growth in exposures due to an 11% increase in gross new policies, an increase in catastrophe losses due to severe weather and a $30 million increase in auto liability reserves in the first quarter of 2014 based upon additional analysis and information regarding continued adverse development of bodily injury claims associated with prior accident years. Catastrophe losses were $42 million for the six months ended June 30, 2014 compared to $20 million for the prior year period. 87AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC.

Our Corporate & Other segment pretax operating loss was $130 million for the six months ended June 30, 2014 compared to $110 million for the prior year period. Our Corporate & Other segment results for the six months ended June 30, 2014 included higher expenses primarily related to the early redemption of our senior notes due 2039, provision for potential resolution of a regulatory matter regarding certain historical events and processes at one of our ongoing lines of business which we believe have since been remediated, and long-term performance compensation awards.Market RiskOur primary market risk exposures are interest rate, equity price, foreign currency exchange rate and credit risk. Equity price and interest rate fluctuations can have a significant impact on our results of operations, primarily due to the effects they have on the asset management and other asset-based fees we earn, the spread income generated on our fixed annuities, fixed insurance, brokerage client cash balances, face amount certificate products and the fixed portion of our variable annuities and variable insurance contracts, the value of DAC and DSIC assets, the value of liabilities for guaranteed benefits associated with our variable annuities and the value of derivatives held to hedge these benefits.Our earnings from fixed annuities, fixed insurance, and the fixed portion of variable annuities and variable insurance contracts are based upon the spread between rates earned on assets held and the rates at which interest is credited to accounts. We primarily invest in fixed rate securities to fund the rate credited to clients. We guarantee an interest rate to the holders of these products. Investment assets and client liabilities generally differ as it relates to basis, repricing or maturity characteristics. Rates credited to clients’ accounts generally reset at shorter intervals than the yield on the underlying investments. Therefore, in an increasing interest rate environment, higher interest rates may be reflected in crediting rates to clients sooner than in rates earned on invested assets, which could result in a reduced spread between the two rates, reduced earned income and a negative impact on pretax income. However, the current low interest rate environment is resulting in interest rates below the level of some of our liability guaranteed minimum interest rates (“GMIRs”). Hence, a modest rise in interest rates would not necessarily result in changes to all the liability credited rates while projected asset purchases would capture the full increase in interest rates. This dynamic would result in widening spreads under a modestly rising rate scenario given the current relationship between the current level of interest rates and the underlying GMIRs on the business. 88AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. As a result of the low interest rate environment, our current reinvestment yields are generally lower than the current portfolio yield. We expect our portfolio income yields to continue to decline in future periods if interest rates remain low. The carrying value and weighted average yield of non-structured fixed maturity securities and commercial mortgage loans that may generate proceeds to reinvest through 2015 due to prepayment, maturity or call activity at the option of the issuer, excluding securities with a make-whole provision, was $2.9 billion and 3.9%, respectively, as of June 30, 2014. In addition, residential mortgage-backed securities, which are subject to prepayment risk as a result of the low interest rate environment, totaled $6.2 billion and had a weighted average yield of 3.3% as of June 30, 2014. While these amounts represent investments that could be subject to reinvestment risk, it is also possible that these investments will be used to fund liabilities or may not be prepaid and will remain invested at their current yields. In addition to the interest rate environment, the mix of benefit payments versus product sales as well as the timing and volumes associated with such mix may impact our investment yield. Furthermore, reinvestment activities and the associated investment yield may also be impacted by corporate strategies implemented at management’s discretion. The average yield for investment purchases during the six months ended June 30, 2014 was approximately 2.8%.The reinvestment of proceeds from maturities, calls and prepayments at rates below the current portfolio yield, which may be below the level of some liability guaranteed minimum interest rates, will have a negative impact to future operating results. To mitigate the unfavorable impact that the low interest rate environment has on our spread income, we assess reinvestment risk in our investment portfolio and monitor this risk in accordance with our asset/liability management framework. In addition, we may reduce the crediting rates on our fixed products when warranted, subject to guaranteed minimums. In the second quarter of 2014, we continued the process of setting lower renewal interest rates for a portion of our fixed annuities that are above the guaranteed minimum, which helps relieve some of the spread compression caused by low rates. Approximately $3.7 billion of the five-year guarantee block has been re-priced and approximately $0.4 billion will be re-priced in the balance of the year.The following table presents the account values of fixed annuities, fixed insurance, and the fixed portion of variable annuities and variable insurance contracts by range of guaranteed minimum crediting rates and the range of the difference between rates credited to contractholders as of June 30, 2014 and the respective guaranteed minimums, as well as the percentage of account values subject to rate reset in the time period indicated. Rates are reset at our discretion, subject to guaranteed minimums.

Each of these guaranteed benefits guarantees payouts to the annuity holder under certain specific conditions regardless of the performance of the underlying investment assets.89AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. The variable annuity guarantees continue to be managed by utilizing a hedging program which attempts to match the sensitivity of the assets with the sensitivity of the liabilities. This approach works with the premise that matched sensitivities will produce a highly effective hedging result. Our comprehensive hedging program focuses mainly on first order sensitivities of assets and liabilities: Equity Market Level (Delta), Interest Rate Level (Rho) and Volatility (Vega). Additionally, various second order sensitivities are managed. We use various index options across the term structure, interest rate swaps and swaptions, total return swaps and futures to manage the risk exposures. The exposures are measured and monitored daily, and adjustments to the hedge portfolio are made as necessary.We have a macro hedge program to provide protection against the statutory tail scenario risk arising from variable annuity reserves on our statutory surplus and to cover some of the residual risks not covered by other hedging activities. We assess the residual risk under a range of scenarios in creating and executing the macro hedge program. As a means of economically hedging these risks, we use a combination of options and/or swaps. Certain of the macro hedge derivatives used contain settlement provisions linked to both equity returns and interest rates; the remaining are interest rate contracts or equity contracts. The macro hedge program could result in additional earnings volatility as changes in the value of the macro hedge derivatives, which are designed to reduce statutory capital volatility, may not be closely aligned to changes in the variable annuity guaranty embedded derivatives.To evaluate interest rate and equity price risk we perform sensitivity testing which measures the impact on pretax income from the sources listed below for a 12-month period following a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates or a hypothetical 10% decline in equity prices. The interest rate risk test assumes a sudden 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve, with rates then staying at those levels for the next 12 months. The equity price risk test assumes a sudden 10% drop in equity prices, with equity prices then staying at those levels for the next 12 months. In estimating the values of variable annuity riders, equity indexed annuities, stock market certificates, indexed universal life insurance and the associated hedge assets, we assume no change in implied market volatility despite the 10% drop in equity prices.The following tables present our estimate of the impact on pretax income from the above defined hypothetical market movements as of June 30, 2014:  Equity Price Exposure to Pretax IncomeEquity Price Decline 10% Before Hedge Impact Hedge Impact Net Impact  (in millions)Asset-based management and distribution fees (1) $(254) $5 $(249)DAC and DSIC amortization (2) (3) (90) — (90)Variable annuity riders:      GMDB and GMIB (3) (84) — (84)GMWB (179) 155 (24)GMAB (34) 29 (5)DAC and DSIC amortization (4) N/A N/A 6Total variable annuity riders (297) 184 (107)Macro hedge program (5) — 19 19Equity indexed annuities 1 (1) —Certificates 2 (2) —Indexed universal life insurance 14 (16) (2)Total $(624) $189 $(429)90AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC.

This is a significantly more conservative estimate than if we assumed management follows its mean reversion guideline and increased near-term rates to recover the drop in equity values over a five-year period. We make this same conservative assumption in estimating the impact from GMDB and GMIB riders.(4) Market impact on DAC and DSIC amortization related to variable annuity riders is modeled net of hedge impact.(5) The market impact of the macro hedge program is modeled net of any related impact to DAC and DSIC amortization.The above results compare to an estimated negative net impact to pretax income of $389 million related to a 10% equity price decline and an estimated positive net impact to pretax income of $49 million related to a 100 basis point increase in interest rates as of December 31, 2013. Net impacts shown in the above table from GMWB and GMAB riders result largely from differences between the liability valuation basis and the hedging basis. Liabilities are valued using fair value accounting principles, with risk margins incorporated in contractholder behavior assumptions and with discount rates increased to reflect a current market estimate of our risk of nonperformance specific to these liabilities. The nonperformance spread risk is not hedged.Actual results could differ materially from those illustrated above as they are based on a number of estimates and assumptions. These include assuming that implied market volatility does not change when equity prices fall by 10%, that management does not increase assumed equity asset growth rates to anticipate recovery of the drop in equity values when valuing DAC, DSIC and GMDB and GMIB liability values and that the 100 basis point increase in interest rates is a parallel shift of the yield curve. Furthermore, we have not tried to anticipate changes in client preferences for different types of assets or other changes in client behavior, nor have we tried to anticipate actions management might take to increase revenues or reduce expenses in these scenarios.The selection of a 100 basis point interest rate increase as well as a 10% equity price decline should not be construed as a prediction of future market events. Impacts of larger or smaller changes in interest rates or equity prices may not be proportional to those shown for a 100 basis point increase in interest rates or a 10% decline in equity prices.91AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. Fair Value MeasurementsWe report certain assets and liabilities at fair value; specifically, separate account assets, derivatives, embedded derivatives, properties held by our consolidated property funds, and most investments and cash equivalents. Fair value assumes the exchange of assets or liabilities occurs in orderly transactions and is not the result of a forced liquidation or distressed sale. We include actual market prices, or observable inputs, in our fair value measurements to the extent available. Broker quotes are obtained when quotes from pricing services are not available. We validate prices obtained from third parties through a variety of means such as: price variance analysis, subsequent sales testing, stale price review, price comparison across pricing vendors and due diligence reviews of vendors. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our fair value measurements.Fair Value of Liabilities and Nonperformance RiskCompanies are required to measure the fair value of liabilities at the price that would be received to transfer the liability to a market participant (an exit price). Since there is not a market for our obligations of our variable annuity riders and indexed universal life insurance, we consider the assumptions participants in a hypothetical market would make to reflect an exit price. As a result, we adjust the valuation of variable annuity riders and indexed universal life insurance by updating certain contractholder assumptions, adding explicit margins to provide for profit, risk and expenses, and adjusting the rates used to discount expected cash flows to reflect a current market estimate of our nonperformance risk. The nonperformance risk adjustment is based on broker quotes for credit default swaps that are adjusted to estimate the risk of our life insurance company subsidiaries not fulfilling these liabilities. Consistent with general market conditions, this estimate resulted in a spread over the LIBOR swap curve as of June 30, 2014. As our estimate of this spread widens or tightens, the liability will decrease or increase. If this nonperformance credit spread moves to a zero spread over the LIBOR swap curve, the reduction to net income would be approximately $82 million, net of DAC, DSIC, unearned revenue amortization, the reinsurance accrual and income taxes (calculated at the statutory tax rate of 35%), based on June 30, 2014 credit spreads. Liquidity and Capital ResourcesOverviewWe maintained substantial liquidity during the six months ended June 30, 2014. At June 30, 2014, we had $2.1 billion in cash and cash equivalents compared to $2.6 billion at December 31, 2013. We have additional liquidity available through an unsecured revolving credit facility for up to $500 million that expires in September 2018. Under the terms of the underlying credit agreement, we can increase this facility to $750 million upon satisfaction of certain approval requirements. Available borrowings under this facility are reduced by any outstanding letters of credit. At June 30, 2014, we had no outstanding borrowings under this credit facility and had $2 million of outstanding letters of credit. Our junior subordinated notes due 2066 and credit facility contain various administrative, reporting, legal and financial covenants. We were in compliance with all such covenants at June 30, 2014.In May 2014, we issued a notice of redemption for $200 million of our senior notes due 2039. The notes were redeemed on June 16, 2014 pursuant to the terms of the indenture at the principal value plus accrued interest to the redemption date. We recognized an expense for the remaining unamortized debt issuance costs on the notes in the second quarter of 2014.We enter into short-term borrowings, which may include repurchase agreements and Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) advances, to reduce reinvestment risk from higher levels of expected annuity net cash flows. Short-term borrowings allow us to receive cash to reinvest in longer-duration assets, while paying back the short-term debt with cash flows generated by the fixed income portfolio. The balance of repurchase agreements at both June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013 was $50 million, which is collateralized with agency residential mortgage backed securities and commercial mortgage backed securities from our investment portfolio. Our subsidiary, RiverSource Life Insurance Company (“RiverSource Life”), is a member of the FHLB of Des Moines, which provides access to collateralized borrowings. As of June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013, we had $150 million and $450 million, respectively, of borrowings from the FHLB, which is collateralized with commercial mortgage backed securities. We believe cash flows from operating activities, available cash balances and our availability of revolver borrowings will be sufficient to fund our operating liquidity needs.Dividends from SubsidiariesAmeriprise Financial is primarily a parent holding company for the operations carried out by our wholly owned subsidiaries. Because of our holding company structure, our ability to meet our cash requirements, including the payment of dividends on our common stock, substantially depends upon the receipt of dividends or return of capital from our subsidiaries, particularly our life insurance subsidiary, RiverSource Life, our face-amount certificate subsidiary, Ameriprise Certificate Company (“ACC”), AMPF Holding Corporation, which is the parent company of our retail introducing broker-dealer subsidiary, Ameriprise Financial Services, Inc. (“AFSI”) and our clearing broker-dealer subsidiary, American Enterprise Investment Services, Inc. (“AEIS”), our Auto and Home insurance subsidiary, IDS Property Casualty Insurance Company (“IDS Property Casualty”), doing business as Ameriprise Auto & Home Insurance, our transfer agent subsidiary, Columbia Management Investment Services Corp., our 92AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. investment advisory company, Columbia Management Investment Advisers, LLC, and Threadneedle. The payment of dividends by many of our subsidiaries is restricted and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to regulatory capital requirements.Actual capital and regulatory capital requirements for our wholly owned subsidiaries subject to regulatory capital requirements were as follows: Actual Capital Regulatory Capital Requirements June 30, 2014 December 31, 2013 June 30, 2014 December 31, 2013 (in millions)RiverSource Life(1)(2)$3,162 $2,747 N/A $591RiverSource Life of NY(1)(2)277 251 N/A 49IDS Property Casualty(1)(3)575 531 $188 177Ameriprise Insurance Company(1)(3)45 44 2 2ACC(4)(5)241 230 225 215Threadneedle(6)395 257 171 158Ameriprise National Trust Bank(7)15 19 10 10AFSI(3)(4)90 78 2 2Ameriprise Captive Insurance Company(3)69 62 13 11Ameriprise Trust Company(3)25 58 23 56AEIS(3)(4)113 100 49 44RiverSource Distributors, Inc.(3)(4)18 23 # #Columbia Management Investment Distributors, Inc.(3)(4)23 23 # #N/A Not applicable.# Amounts are less than $1 million.(1) Actual capital is determined on a statutory basis.(2) Regulatory capital requirement is based on the statutory risk-based capital filing.(3) Regulatory capital requirement is based on the applicable regulatory requirement, calculated as of June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013.(4) Actual capital is determined on an adjusted GAAP basis.(5) ACC is required to hold capital in compliance with the Minnesota Department of Commerce and SEC capital requirements.(6) Actual capital and regulatory capital requirements are determined in accordance with U.K. regulatory legislation. The regulatory capital requirements at June 30, 2014 represent management’s assessment at December 31, 2013 of the risk based requirements, as specified by FCA regulations.(7) Ameriprise National Trust Bank is required to maintain capital in compliance with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency regulations and policies.In addition to the particular regulations restricting dividend payments and establishing subsidiary capitalization requirements, we take into account the overall health of the business, capital levels and risk management considerations in determining a dividend strategy for payments to our company from our subsidiaries, and in deciding to use cash to make capital contributions to our subsidiaries.During the six months ended June 30, 2014, the parent holding company received cash dividends or a return of capital from its subsidiaries of $725 million (including $300 million from RiverSource Life) and contributed cash to its subsidiaries of $6 million. During the six months ended June 30, 2013, the parent holding company received cash dividends or a return of capital from its subsidiaries of $990 million (including $535 million from RiverSource Life) and contributed cash to its subsidiaries of $28 million.Dividends Paid to Shareholders and Share Repurchases We paid regular quarterly dividends to our shareholders totaling $215 million and $202 million for the six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively. On July 29, 2014, we announced a quarterly dividend of $0.58 per common share. The dividend will be paid on August 22, 2014 to our shareholders of record at the close of business on August 11, 2014.In October 2012, our Board of Directors authorized an expenditure of up to $2.0 billion for the repurchase of shares of our common stock through 2014. In April 2014, our Board of Directors authorized an expenditure of up to an additional $2.5 billion for the repurchase of shares of our common stock through April 28, 2016. As of June 30, 2014, the Company had $2.4 billion remaining under its share repurchase authorization. We intend to fund share repurchases through existing working capital, future earnings and other customary financing methods. The share repurchase programs do not require the purchase of any minimum number of shares, and depending on market conditions and other factors, these purchases may be commenced or suspended at any time without prior notice. Acquisitions under the share repurchase programs may be made in the open market, through privately negotiated transactions or block trades or other means. During the six months ended June 30, 2014, we repurchased a total of 6.4 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $110.54 per share.93AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. Cash FlowsCash flows of CIEs are reflected in our cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities, investing activities and financing activities. Cash held by CIEs is not available for general use by Ameriprise Financial, nor is Ameriprise Financial cash available for general use by its CIEs. As such, the operating, investing and financing cash flows of the CIEs have no impact to the change in cash and cash equivalents.Operating ActivitiesNet cash provided by operating activities was $364 million for the six months ended June 30, 2014 compared to net cash used in operating activities of $93 million for the prior year period. The change in net cash provided by (used in) operating activities compared to prior year period was primarily due to a $194 million increase in cash flows related to changes in amounts due to brokers, a $166 million increase in cash flows related to cash held by CIEs and an increase in fee revenue partially offset by related expenses.Investing ActivitiesOur investing activities primarily relate to our Available-for-Sale investment portfolio. Further, this activity is significantly affected by the net flows of our investment certificate, fixed annuity and universal life products reflected in financing activities.Net cash provided by investing activities decreased $532 million to $158 million for the six months ended June 30, 2014 compared to $690 million for the prior year period primarily due to a $703 million decrease in proceeds from sales, maturities and repayments of investments by consolidated investment entities and a $483 million decrease in proceeds from maturities, sinking fund payments and calls of Available-for-Sale securities, partially offset by a $769 million decrease in cash used for purchases of Available-for-Sale securities.Financing ActivitiesNet cash used in financing activities increased $409 million to $1.0 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2014 compared to $618 million for the prior year period. Cash outflows from surrenders and other benefits of policyholder account balances increased $338 million compared to the prior year period. Cash outflows from changes in short-term borrowings increased $300 million compared to the prior year period as we reduced our borrowings from the FHLB in the first half of 2014. Cash outflows related to repayments of debt increased $200 million due to the redemption of our senior notes due 2039 in the second quarter of 2014. Cash inflows related to CIEs increased $530 million compared to the prior year period primarily due to a $500 million increase in borrowings of CIEs.Contractual CommitmentsThere have been no material changes to our contractual obligations disclosed in our 2013 10-K.
