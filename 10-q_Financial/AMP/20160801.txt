Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2015 10-K, “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2016 filed with the SEC on May 5, 2016, this Form 10-Q and other factors as discussed herein.Equity price, credit market and interest rate fluctuations can have a significant impact on our results of operations, primarily due to the effects they have on the asset management and other asset-based fees we earn, the “spread” income generated on our fixed annuities, fixed insurance, deposit products and the fixed portion of variable annuities and variable insurance contracts, the value of deferred acquisition costs (“DAC”) and deferred sales inducement costs (“DSIC”) assets, the values of liabilities for guaranteed benefits associated with our variable annuities and the values of derivatives held to hedge these benefits.Earnings, as well as operating earnings, will continue to be negatively impacted by the ongoing low interest rate environment. In addition to continuing spread compression in our interest sensitive product lines, a sustained low interest rate environment may result in increases to our reserves and changes in various rate assumptions we use to amortize DAC and DSIC, which may negatively impact our operating earnings. For additional discussion on our interest rate risk, see Item 3. “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.”We consolidate certain variable interest entities for which we provide asset management services. These entities are defined as consolidated investment entities (“CIEs”). While the consolidation of the CIEs impacts our balance sheet and income statement, our exposure to these entities is unchanged and there is no impact to the underlying business results. For further information on CIEs, see Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Effective January 1, 2016, we adopted ASU 2015-02 - Consolidation: Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis and deconsolidated several collateralized loan obligations (“CLOs”) and all previously consolidated property funds. See Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the adoption impact. Effective January 1, 2016, we no longer have net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests primarily due to the deconsolidation of property funds. The results of operations of the CIEs are reflected in the Corporate & Other segment. On a consolidated basis, the management fees we earn for the services we provide to the CIEs and the related general and administrative expenses are eliminated and the changes in the fair value of assets and liabilities related to the CIEs, primarily syndicated loans and debt, are reflected in net investment income. We continue to include the fees from these entities in the management and financial advice fees line within our Asset Management segment. Effective January 1, 2016, we adopted ASU 2014-13 - Consolidation: Measuring the Financial Assets and the Financial Liabilities of a Consolidated Collateralized Financing Entity and elected the measurement alternative. As a result, the carrying value of the CIE debt is set equal to the fair value of the CIE assets; therefore the changes in the fair value of assets and liabilities related to CIEs is nil. The CIE debt held by Ameriprise Financial is eliminated in consolidation. See Note 2 and Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.55AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. While our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), management believes that operating measures, which exclude net realized investment gains or losses, net of the related DSIC and DAC amortization, unearned revenue amortization and the reinsurance accrual; the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits, net of hedges and the related DSIC and DAC amortization; the market impact on indexed universal life benefits, net of hedges and the related DAC amortization, unearned revenue amortization and the reinsurance accrual; the market impact of hedges to offset interest rate changes on unrealized gains or losses for certain investments; integration and restructuring charges; income (loss) from discontinued operations; and the impact of consolidating CIEs, best reflect the underlying performance of our core operations and facilitate a more meaningful trend analysis. Management uses certain of these non-GAAP measures to evaluate our financial performance on a basis comparable to that used by some securities analysts and investors. Also, certain of these non-GAAP measures are taken into consideration, to varying degrees, for purposes of business planning and analysis and for certain compensation-related matters. Throughout our Management’s Discussion and Analysis, these non-GAAP measures are referred to as operating measures. These non-GAAP measures should not be viewed as a substitute for U.S. GAAP measures.It is management’s priority to increase shareholder value over a multi-year horizon by achieving our on-average, over-time financial targets.Our financial targets are:•Operating total net revenue growth of 6% to 8%,•Operating earnings per diluted share growth of 12% to 15%, and•Operating return on equity excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) of 19% to 23%.The following tables reconcile our GAAP measures to operating measures:  Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, 2016 2015 2016 2015 (in millions)Total net revenues$2,871 $3,128 $5,636 $6,181Less: Revenue attributable to CIEs26 141 50 290Less: Net realized gains (losses)5 5 (11) 15Less: Market impact on indexed universal life benefits3 — 12 (4)Less: Market impact of hedges on investments(19) (1) (59) (1)Operating total net revenues$2,856 $2,983 $5,644 $5,881 Three Months Ended June 30, Per Diluted Share Three Months Ended June 30, 2016 20152016 2015 (in millions, except per share amounts)Net income attributable to Ameriprise Financial$335 $415 $1.97 $2.23Add: Integration/restructuring charges (1)— 1 — 0.01Add: Market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits (1)58 36 0.34 0.19Add: Market impact on indexed universal life benefits (1)(5) (5) (0.03) (0.03)Add: Market impact of hedges on investments (1)19 1 0.11 0.01Less: Net realized gains (1)5 5 0.03 0.03Tax effect of adjustments (2)(23) (9) (0.13) (0.05)Operating earnings$379 $434 $2.23 $2.33        Weighted average common shares outstanding:       Basic168.3 183.8    Diluted170.1 186.4    (1) Pretax operating adjustments.(2) Calculated using the statutory tax rate of 35%.56AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC.

After-tax is calculated using the statutory rate of 35%.On April 8, 2016, the Department of Labor published its final rule regarding the definition of who is an investment advice fiduciary under ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code, a new “best interest contract” prohibited transaction exemption regarding how such 57AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. advice can be provided to retirement investors (primarily account holders in 401(k) plans and IRAs and other types of ERISA clients), a new class prohibited transaction exemption for how ERISA investment advice fiduciaries can engage in certain principal transactions with retirement investors, and certain amendments and partial revocations of pre-existing exemptions. These regulations focus in large part on conflicts of interest related to investment recommendations made by financial advisors, registered investment advisors, and other investment professionals to retirement investors, how financial advisors are able to discuss IRA rollovers, as well as how financial advisors and affiliates can transact with retirement investors. Qualified accounts, particularly IRAs, make up a significant portion of our assets under management and administration. We are continuing to review and analyze the potential impact of the regulations on our clients and prospective clients as well as the potential impact on our business. Teams across the company are working diligently to assess these principles-based rules and we will work with, and provide guidance to, our advisors to make the necessary changes to effectively implement these new rules.Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesThe accounting and reporting policies that we use affect our Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of our accounting and reporting policies are critical to an understanding of our consolidated results of operations and financial condition and, in some cases, the application of these policies can be significantly affected by the estimates, judgments and assumptions made by management during the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements. These accounting policies are discussed in detail in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis — Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” in our 2015 10-K.Recent Accounting PronouncementsFor information regarding recent accounting pronouncements and their expected impact on our future consolidated results of operations and financial condition, see Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.Assets Under Management and AdministrationAssets under management (“AUM”) include external client assets for which we provide investment management services, such as the assets of the Columbia funds and Threadneedle funds, assets of institutional clients and assets of clients in our advisor platform held in wrap accounts as well as assets managed by sub-advisers selected by us. AUM also includes certain assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets for which we provide investment management services and recognize management fees in our Asset Management segment, such as the assets of the general account and the variable product funds held in the separate accounts of our life insurance subsidiaries and CIEs. These assets do not include assets under advisement, for which we provide model portfolios but do not have full discretionary investment authority. Corporate & Other AUM primarily includes former bank assets that are managed within our Corporate & Other segment.Assets under administration (“AUA”) include assets for which we provide administrative services such as client assets invested in other companies’ products that we offer outside of our wrap accounts. These assets include those held in clients’ brokerage accounts. We generally record revenues received from administered assets as distribution fees. We do not exercise management discretion over these assets and do not earn a management fee. These assets are not reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. AUA also includes certain assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets for which we do not provide investment management services and do not recognize management fees, such as investments in non-affiliated funds held in the separate accounts of our life insurance subsidiaries. These assets do not include assets under advisement, for which we provide model portfolios but do not have full discretionary investment authority.The following table presents detail regarding our AUM and AUA: June 30,   2016 2015 Change (in billions)  Assets Under Management and Administration       Advice & Wealth Management AUM$188.6 $181.1 $7.5 4 %Asset Management AUM459.6 503.1 (43.5) (9)Corporate & Other AUM0.4 0.7 (0.3) (43)Eliminations(24.1) (23.2) (0.9) (4)Total Assets Under Management624.5 661.7 (37.2) (6)Total Assets Under Administration152.1 149.4 2.7 2Total AUM and AUA$776.6 $811.1 $(34.5) (4)%Total AUM decreased $37.2 billion, or 6%, to $624.5 billion as of June 30, 2016 compared to $661.7 billion as of June 30, 2015 reflecting a $43.5 billion decrease in Asset Management AUM driven by equity market depreciation, net outflows and the negative impact of foreign currency translation, and a $7.5 billion increase in Advice & Wealth Management AUM driven by wrap account net inflows, partially offset by equity market depreciation. See our segment results of operations discussion below for additional information on changes in our AUM.58AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. Consolidated Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 The following table presents our consolidated results of operations: Three Months Ended June 30,   2016 2015 Change (in millions)  Revenues       Management and financial advice fees$1,439 $1,518 $(79) (5)%Distribution fees448 472 (24) (5)Net investment income372 423 (51) (12)Premiums372 368 4 1Other revenues248 354 (106) (30)Total revenues2,879 3,135 (256) (8)Banking and deposit interest expense8 7 1 14Total net revenues2,871 3,128 (257) (8)Expenses       Distribution expenses803 835 (32) (4)Interest credited to fixed accounts158 160 (2) (1)Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses597 543 54 10Amortization of deferred acquisition costs87 94 (7) (7)Interest and debt expense53 89 (36) (40)General and administrative expense763 792 (29) (4)Total expenses2,461 2,513 (52) (2)Pretax income410 615 (205) (33)Income tax provision75 139 (64) (46)Net income335 476 (141) (30)Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests— 61 (61) NMNet income attributable to Ameriprise Financial$335 $415 $(80) (19)%NM Not Meaningful.OverallPretax income decreased $205 million, or 33%, to $410 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $615 million for the prior year period primarily due to a $61 million decrease in net income from CIEs, an $18 million unfavorable change in the market impact of hedges on investments, a $23 million expense from the resolution of a legacy legal matter related to the hedge fund business, asset management net outflows, equity market depreciation, lower transactional volume, higher incurred losses on current accident year auto business, the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits (net of hedges and the related DSIC and DAC amortization) and an $18 million long term care (“LTC”) reserve release in the prior year period, partially offset by lower catastrophe losses. Net income from CIEs was nil for the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $61 million for the prior year period primarily reflecting the deconsolidation of CIEs effective January 1, 2016. As we elected the measurement alternative for the remaining consolidated CLOs as of January 1, 2016, the carrying value of the CIE debt is set equal to the fair value of the CIE assets and therefore the changes in the fair value of assets and liabilities related to CIEs is nil for the three months ended June 30, 2016. Results for the three months ended June 30, 2016 included $16 million of management fees we earned for services provided to deconsolidated CIEs. These fees were eliminated on a consolidated basis in the prior year period. See Note 2 and Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on CIEs.The market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits (net of hedges and the related DSIC and DAC amortization) was an expense of $58 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to an expense of $36 million for the prior year period. Net RevenuesNet revenues decreased $257 million, or 8%, to $2.9 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $3.1 billion for the prior year period primarily due to decreases in management and financial advice fees and distribution fees and the CIE 59AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. deconsolidation. Net revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2016 included $26 million of CIE revenues compared to $141 million for the prior year period primarily reflecting the CIE deconsolidation. Management and financial advice fees decreased $79 million, or 5%, to $1.4 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $1.5 billion for the prior year period primarily due to lower asset-based fees driven by a decrease in average AUM, as well as an $18 million decrease in performance fees. Average AUM decreased $40.1 billion, or 6%, compared to the prior year period due to asset management net outflows, equity market depreciation and the negative impact of foreign currency translation, partially offset by wrap account net inflows. See our discussion on the changes in AUM in our segment results of operations section. Management and financial advice fees for the three months ended June 30, 2016 included $16 million of fees we earned for services provided to CLOs and property funds that were deconsolidated effective January 1, 2016. These fees were eliminated on a consolidated basis in the prior year period.Distribution fees decreased $24 million, or 5%, to $448 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $472 million for the prior year period primarily due to lower client activity and equity market depreciation, partially offset by higher brokerage cash spread due to an increase in short-term interest rates.Net investment income decreased $51 million, or 12%, to $372 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $423 million for the prior year period primarily due to a $24 million decrease in CIE net investment income, an $18 million increase in loss related to the market impact of hedges on investments and a $12 million decrease in investment income on fixed maturities. Net investment income for the three months ended June 30, 2016 included $30 million CIE net investment income compared to $54 million for the prior year period primarily reflecting the CIE deconsolidation.Other revenues decreased $106 million, or 30%, to $248 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $354 million for the prior year period primarily due to a $102 million decrease in CIE other revenues reflecting the CIE deconsolidation.ExpensesTotal expenses decreased $52 million, or 2%, to $2.5 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the prior year period due to a decrease in distribution expenses and the CIE deconsolidation, partially offset by an increase in benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses. Expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2016 included $25 million of CIE expenses compared to $80 million for the prior year period primarily reflecting the CIE deconsolidation. Distribution expenses decreased $32 million, or 4%, to $803 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $835 million for the prior year period driven by lower advisor compensation due to equity market depreciation and lower client activity. See our discussion on the changes in AUM in our segment results of operations section below.Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses increased $54 million, or 10%, to $597 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $543 million for the prior year period primarily reflecting the following items:•An $11 million increase related to our auto and home business primarily reflecting higher incurred losses on current accident year auto business, partially offset by lower catastrophe losses. Catastrophe losses were $37 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $48 million for the prior year period. •An $18 million LTC reserve release in the prior year period. •A $6 million increase in expense related to higher reserve funding driven by the impact of higher fees from variable annuity guarantee sales in the prior year where the fees start on the first anniversary date.•A $179 million decrease in expense compared to the prior year period from the unhedged nonperformance credit spread risk adjustment on variable annuity guaranteed benefits. As the embedded derivative liability on which the nonperformance credit spread is applied increases (decreases), the impact of the nonperformance credit spread is favorable (unfavorable) to expense. The favorable impact of the nonperformance credit spread was $115 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to an unfavorable impact of $64 million for the prior year period.•A $199 million increase in expense from other market impacts on variable annuity guaranteed benefits, net of hedges in place to offset those risks and the related DSIC amortization. This increase was the result of an unfavorable $1.2 billion change in the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits reserves, a favorable $1.0 billion change in the market impact on derivatives hedging the variable annuity guaranteed benefits and a favorable $2 million DSIC offset. The main market drivers contributing to these changes are summarized below:•Interest rate impact on the variable annuity guaranteed living benefits liability net of the impact on the corresponding hedge assets resulted in an expense in the second quarter of 2016 compared to a benefit in the prior year period.•Market volatility impact on the variable annuity guaranteed living benefits liability net of the impact on the corresponding hedge assets resulted in an expense in the second quarter of 2016 compared to a benefit in the prior year period.•Other unhedged items, including the difference between the assumed and actual underlying separate account investment performance, fixed income credit exposures, transaction costs and various behavioral items, were a net unfavorable impact compared to the prior year period.60AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. Interest and debt expense decreased $36 million, or 40%, to $53 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $89 million for the prior year period primarily due to a $35 million decrease in CIE interest and debt expense reflecting the CIE deconsolidation. General and administrative expenses decreased $29 million, or 4%, to $763 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $792 million for the prior year period primarily due a $20 million decrease in CIE expenses reflecting the CIE deconsolidation, an $8 million decrease in compensation related to lower performance fees, lower investment spending and lower performance-based compensation expense, partially offset by $7 million of incremental expense related to the planning and implementation of the new Department of Labor fiduciary standard and $23 million of expense in the second quarter of 2016 from the resolution of a legacy legal matter related to the hedge fund business. Income TaxesOur effective tax rate was 18.4% for the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to 22.6% for the prior year period. The effective tax rate for the three months ended June 30, 2016 was lower than the statutory rate as a result of tax preferred items including the dividends received deduction, low income housing tax credits, and lower taxes on net income from foreign subsidiaries. The decrease in the effective tax rate for the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the prior year period was primarily due to a $17 million benefit in the second quarter of 2016 primarily related to the completion of tax audits from previous years. Results of Operations by Segment for the Three Months Ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 Operating earnings is the measure of segment profit or loss management uses to evaluate segment performance. Operating earnings should not be viewed as a substitute for GAAP pretax income. We believe the presentation of segment operating earnings as we measure it for management purposes enhances the understanding of our business by reflecting the underlying performance of our core operations and facilitating a more meaningful trend analysis. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the presentation of segment results and our definition of operating earnings.The following table presents summary financial information by segment: Three Months Ended June 30, 2016 2015 (in millions)Advice & Wealth Management   Net revenues$1,250 $1,274Expenses1,029 1,054Operating earnings$221 $220Asset Management   Net revenues$739 $832Expenses591 635Operating earnings$148 $197Annuities   Net revenues$619 $651Expenses473 501Operating earnings$146 $150Protection   Net revenues$604 $600Expenses567 528Operating earnings$37 $72Corporate & Other   Net revenues$(7) $(2)Expenses69 55Operating loss$(76) $(57)61AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC.

Pretax operating margin was 17.7% for the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to 17.3% for the prior year period.Net RevenuesNet revenues exclude net realized investment gains or losses. Net revenues decreased $24 million, or 2%, to $1.3 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the prior year period due to lower distribution fees, partially offset by higher net investment income. Operating net revenue per branded advisor decreased to $128,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2016, down 2%, from $131,000 for the prior year period reflecting lower transactional client activity. Total branded advisors were 9,758 at June 30, 2016 compared to 9,721 at June 30, 2015. Management and financial fees increased $3 million to $669 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $666 million for the prior year period primarily due to wrap account net inflows, partially offset by equity market depreciation.Distribution fees decreased $37 million, or 7%, to $524 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $561 million for the prior year period primarily due to lower client activity and equity market depreciation, partially offset by higher brokerage cash spread due to an increase in short-term interest rates.Net investment income increased $12 million, or 34%, to $47 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $35 million for the prior year period primarily due to an increase in invested balances driven by certificate net inflows and higher investment yields. ExpensesTotal expenses decreased $25 million, or 2%, to $1.0 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $1.1 billion for the prior year period primarily due to a $21 million decrease in distribution expenses reflecting lower advisor compensation due to equity market depreciation and lower client activity.Asset ManagementFee waivers have been provided to the Columbia Money Market Funds (the “Funds”) by Columbia and certain other subsidiaries performing services for the Funds for the purpose of reducing the expenses charged to a Fund in a given period to maintain or improve a Fund’s net yield in that period. Our subsidiaries may enter into contractual arrangements with the Funds identifying the specific fees to be waived and/or expenses to be reimbursed, as well as the time period for which such waivers will apply. In aggregate, we voluntarily waived fees of nil and $2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.The following tables present the mutual fund performance of our retail Columbia and Threadneedle funds as of June 30:ColumbiaMutual Fund Rankings in top 2 Lipper Quartiles2016 2015Domestic EquityEqual weighted1 year56% 59%  3 year71% 65%  5 year59% 65% Asset weighted1 year65% 64%  3 year84% 68%  5 year73% 74%International EquityEqual weighted1 year55% 77%  3 year60% 77%  5 year61% 70% Asset weighted1 year36% 48%  3 year36% 47%  5 year42% 45%Taxable Fixed IncomeEqual weighted1 year58% 58%  3 year59% 65%  5 year82% 71% Asset weighted1 year61% 69%  3 year65% 85%  5 year87% 86%63AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC.

Only funds with Class Z shares are included. In instances where a fund’s Class Z share does not have a full five year track record (prior to September 30, 2015), performance for an older share class of the same fund, typically Class A shares, is utilized for the period before Class Z shares were launched. No adjustments to the historical track records are made to account for differences in fund expenses between share classes of a fund. Starting September 30, 2015, legacy RiverSource funds have reached 5 years of Z share performance and will not be appended. Historical rankings will continue to be appended.

Aggregated Allocation (Managed) Funds include funds that invest in other funds of the Threadneedle range including those funds that invest in both equity and fixed income. Aggregated Threadneedle data includes funds on the Threadneedle platform sub-advised by Columbia as well as advisors not affiliated with Ameriprise Financial, Inc.Beginning in the first quarter of 2016, the Columbia and Threadneedle AUM rollforwards have been combined to align with the Columbia Threadneedle Investments brand, which represents the combined capabilities, resources and reach of both firms. In addition, we combined the rollforwards for Institutional and Alternative AUM and included the change in Affiliated General Account Assets in the market appreciation (depreciation) and other line within the combined AUM rollforward.

The full impact of the UK referendum result remains uncertain. This uncertainty, which is expected to last for a lengthy period of time, has had and may continue to have a negative impact on our UK and European net flows and foreign currency translation resulting from the weakening of the British Pound.Total segment AUM decreased $4.5 billion, or 1%, during the three months ended June 30, 2016 driven by net outflows and a negative impact of foreign currency translation related to the UK referendum result, partially offset by market appreciation and other. Total segment AUM net outflows were $4.7 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2016, which included $2.3 billion of outflows of former parent-related assets. Management expects, consistent with prior patterns of outflows, that outflows of primarily low margin assets directly or indirectly affiliated with Threadneedle and Columbia former parent companies will continue for the foreseeable future. The overall impact to segment results is difficult to quantify due to uncertain timing, volume and mix of the outflows. Global retail funds decreased $0.6 billion during the three months ended June 30, 2016 due to net outflows, distributions and a negative impact of foreign currency translation, partially offset by market appreciation and other. Global retail net outflows of $0.2 billion during the three months ended June 30, 2016 primarily included $0.7 billion of outflows from the Columbia Acorn® Fund, $0.5 billion of outflows of our variable product funds underlying insurance and annuity separate accounts, $0.3 billion of outflows from former parent-related assets and UK and European net outflows of $0.7 billion reflecting the uncertainty related to the UK’s 66AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. decision to leave the EU, offset by normal seasonal increases in reinvested dividends. Global institutional AUM decreased $3.9 billion, or 2%, during the three months ended June 30, 2016 due to net outflows of $4.5 billion and a $6.0 billion negative impact of foreign currency translation, partially offset by market appreciation and other. Global institutional net outflows included $0.5 billion of outflows related to a CLO unwind and $2.0 billion of outflows of former parent-related assets, of which $0.8 billion was driven by changes made to individually managed accounts by a former affiliated distribution partner.

Net RevenuesNet revenues, which exclude net realized investment gains or losses, decreased $93 million, or 11%, to $739 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $832 million for the prior year period primarily due to a decrease in management and financial advice fees.Management and financial advice fees decreased $84 million, or 12%, to $612 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $696 million for the prior year period primarily due to lower asset-based fees driven by a decrease in average AUM and an $18 million decrease in performance fees. Average AUM decreased $43.5 billion, or 9%, compared to the prior year period due to net outflows, equity market depreciation and the negative impact of foreign currency translation. Our average weighted equity index, which is a proxy for equity movements on AUM, decreased 5% to 1,516 for the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to 1,591 for the prior year period. ExpensesTotal expenses decreased $44 million, or 7%, to $591 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $635 million for the prior year period due to a $24 million decrease in distribution expenses from lower retail fund assets and a decrease in general and administrative expense. General and administrative expense decreased $18 million, or 5%, to $327 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $345 million for the prior year period primarily due to an $8 million decrease in compensation related to lower performance fees and lower investment spending, partially offset by a $9 million expense from the resolution of a legacy legal matter related to the hedge fund business. 67AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC.

RiverSource variable annuity account balances decreased 3% to $74.6 billion at June 30, 2016 compared to the prior year period due to net outflows of $1.3 billion and equity market depreciation. RiverSource fixed annuity account balances declined 8% to $10.3 billion at June 30, 2016 compared to the prior year period as older policies continue to lapse and new sales are limited due to low interest rates. Given the current interest rate environment, our current fixed annuity book is expected to gradually run off and earnings on our fixed annuity business will trend down.Net RevenuesNet revenues, which exclude net realized investment gains or losses, decreased $32 million, or 5%, to $619 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $651 million for the prior year period primarily due to lower management and financial advice fees and net investment income, partially offset by higher other revenues.Management and financial advice fees decreased $8 million, or 4%, to $184 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $192 million for the prior year period due to lower fees on variable annuities driven by lower average separate account balances. Average variable annuity account balances decreased $4.2 billion, or 6%, from the prior year period due to net outflows and equity market depreciation.Net investment income, which excludes net realized investment gains or losses, decreased $29 million, or 13%, to $189 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $218 million for the prior year period reflecting a decrease of approximately $19 million from lower invested assets primarily due to fixed annuity net outflows and approximately $10 million from lower interest rates.Other revenues increased $9 million, or 8%, to $126 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $117 million for the prior year period due to higher fees from variable annuity guarantee sales in the prior year where the fees start on the first anniversary date and higher average fee rates.68AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. ExpensesTotal expenses, which exclude the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits (net of hedges and the related DSIC and DAC amortization) and the DAC and DSIC offset to net realized investment gains or losses, decreased $28 million, or 6%, to $473 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $501 million for the prior year period primarily due to decreases in distribution expenses, interest credited to fixed accounts and amortization of DAC. Distribution expenses decreased $9 million, or 8%, to $107 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $116 million for the prior year period due to lower variable annuity compensation driven by lower sales and lower average separate account balances.Interest credited to fixed accounts decreased $6 million, or 5%, to $119 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $125 million for the prior year period driven by lower average fixed annuity account balances. Average fixed annuity account balances decreased $1.0 billion, or 9%, to $10.4 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the prior year period as older policies continue to lapse and new sales are limited due to low interest rates.Amortization of DAC decreased $11 million, or 19%, to $48 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $59 million for the prior year period primarily due to better than expected persistency and the impact on DAC from actual versus expected market performance based on our view of bond and equity performance, which was a benefit of $1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to an expense of $4 million for the prior year period.ProtectionThe following table presents the results of operations of our Protection segment on an operating basis: Three Months Ended June 30, Change 2016 2015 (in millions)  Revenues       Management and financial advice fees$12 $13 $(1) (8)%Distribution fees25 24 1 4Net investment income121 118 3 3Premiums345 341 4 1Other revenues101 104 (3) (3)Total revenues604 600 4 1Banking and deposit interest expense— — — —Total net revenues604 600 4 1Expenses      Distribution expenses13 16 (3) (19)Interest credited to fixed accounts43 39 4 10Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses399 368 31 8Amortization of deferred acquisition costs34 35 (1) (3)Interest and debt expense8 8 — —General and administrative expense70 62 8 13Total expenses567 528 39 7Operating earnings$37 $72 $(35) (49)%Our Protection segment pretax operating earnings, which excludes net realized investment gains or losses (net of the related DAC amortization, unearned revenue amortization and the reinsurance accrual) and the market impact on indexed universal life benefits (net of hedges and the related DAC amortization, unearned revenue amortization and the reinsurance accrual), decreased $35 million, or 49%, to $37 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $72 million for the prior year period primarily due to an $18 million LTC reserve release in the prior year period and higher auto and home losses.Net RevenuesNet revenues, which exclude net realized investment gains or losses (net of unearned revenue amortization and the reinsurance accrual) and the unearned revenue amortization and the reinsurance accrual offset to the market impact on indexed universal life benefits, increased $4 million, or 1%, to $604 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $600 million for the prior year period primarily due to higher premiums driven by rate increases on our auto and home policies.69AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. ExpensesTotal expenses, which exclude the market impact on indexed universal life benefits (net of hedges and the related DAC amortization) and the DAC offset to net realized investment gains or losses, increased $39 million, or 7%, to $567 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $528 million for the prior year period primarily due to an increase in benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses. Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses increased $31 million, or 8%, to $399 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $368 million for the prior year period primarily due to an $18 million LTC reserve release in the prior year period, a $17 million increase in incurred losses on current accident year auto business and a $6 million increase in LTC claims, partially offset by lower catastrophe losses. Catastrophe losses were $37 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016, primarily from hail and wind storms in southern and central regions of the country, compared to $48 million for the prior year period. General and administrative expense increased $8 million, or 13%, to $70 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $62 million for the prior year period primarily due to an increase in staff and investments in our auto and home business.Corporate & OtherThe following table presents the results of operations of our Corporate & Other segment on an operating basis: Three Months Ended June 30, Change 2016 2015 (in millions)  Revenues       Net investment loss$(6) $(10) $4 40 %Other revenues(1) 8 (9) NMTotal revenues(7) (2) (5) NMBanking and deposit interest expense— — — —Total net revenues(7) (2) (5) NMExpenses       Interest and debt expense5 4 1 25General and administrative expense64 51 13 25Total expenses69 55 14 25Operating loss$(76) $(57) $(19) (33)%NM Not Meaningful.Our Corporate & Other segment pretax operating loss excludes net realized investment gains or losses, the market impact of hedges to offset interest rate changes on unrealized gains or losses for certain investments, integration and restructuring charges, and the impact of consolidating CIEs. Our Corporate & Other segment pretax operating loss increased $19 million, or 33%, to $76 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $57 million for the prior year period primarily due to a $9 million decrease in other revenues and a $13 million increase in general and administrative expense. Other revenues decreased $9 million compared to the prior year period due to a $4 million loss on the sale of real estate in the second quarter of 2016 and a $7 million gain on the sale of a building in the second quarter of 2015.General and administrative expense increased $13 million, or 25%, to $64 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $51 million for the prior year period due to $7 million of incremental expense related to the planning and implementation of the new Department of Labor fiduciary standard and a $14 million expense from the resolution of a legacy legal matter related to the hedge fund business. 70AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC.

Net realized investment losses were $11 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to net realized investment gains of $15 million for the prior year period.Net loss from CIEs for the six months ended June 30, 2016 was $1 million compared to net income of $147 million primarily reflecting the deconsolidation of CIEs effective January 1, 2016. Results for the six months ended June 30, 2016 included $24 million of management fees we earned for services provided to deconsolidated CIEs. These fees were eliminated on a consolidated basis in the prior year period.71AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. The market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits (net of hedges and the related DSIC and DAC amortization) was an expense of $41 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to an expense of $70 million for the prior year period. The market impact on indexed universal life benefits (net of hedges and the related DAC amortization, unearned revenue amortization and the reinsurance accrual) was a benefit of $24 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to an expense of $1 million for the prior year period.The impact on DAC, DSIC and reserves for insurance features in non-traditional long-duration contracts from actual versus expected market performance based on our view of bond and equity performance was an expense of $9 million ($5 million for DAC, $1 million for DSIC and $3 million for insurance features in non-traditional long duration contracts) for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to a benefit of $16 million ($5 million for DAC, $1 million for DSIC and $10 million for insurance features in non-traditional long duration contracts) for the prior year period. The primary driver of the year-over-year difference is due to a change in how we are recalibrating expected bond fund returns based on current interest rates and spreads while still assuming ultimate rates and spreads do not change from our original expectations. Previously, the difference between actual and expected interest rates directly impacted income in the current period and there would be an offsetting impact during annual unlocking. The prior year benefit reflected favorable equity market and bond fund returns.Net RevenuesNet revenues decreased $545 million, or 9%, to $5.6 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $6.2 billion for the prior year period primarily due to decreases in management and financial advice fees, distribution fees, net investment income and other revenues. Net revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2016 included $50 million of CIE revenues compared to $290 million for the prior year period primarily reflecting the CIE deconsolidation. Management and financial advice fees decreased $161 million, or 5%, to $2.8 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $3.0 billion for the prior year period primarily due to lower asset-based fees driven by a decrease in average AUM, as well as a $16 million decrease in performance fees. Average AUM decreased $45.3 billion, or 7%, compared to the prior year period due to asset management net outflows, equity market depreciation and the negative impact of foreign currency translation, partially offset by wrap account net inflows. See our discussion on the changes in AUM in our segment results of operations section. Management and financial advice fees for the six months ended June 30, 2016 included $24 million of fees we earned for services provided to CLOs and property funds that were deconsolidated effective January 1, 2016. These fees were eliminated on a consolidated basis in the prior year period.Distribution fees decreased $55 million, or 6%, to $883 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $938 million for the prior year period primarily due to equity market depreciation and lower client activity, partially offset by higher brokerage cash spread due to an increase in short-term interest rates.Net investment income decreased $204 million, or 22%, to $703 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $907 million for the prior year period primarily due to a $101 million decrease in CIE net investment income, a $58 million unfavorable change in the market impact of hedges on investments and a $23 million decrease in investment income on fixed maturities. In addition, net realized investment losses were $11 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016, which included an $11 million loss from the sale of consumer loans, compared to net realized investment gains of $15 million for the prior year period. Net investment income for the six months ended June 30, 2016 included $58 million CIE net investment income compared to $159 million for the prior year period primarily reflecting the CIE deconsolidation.Other revenues decreased $141 million, or 22%, to $502 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $643 million for the prior year period due to a $160 million decrease in CIE other revenues reflecting the CIE deconsolidation, partially offset by the unearned revenue amortization and the reinsurance accrual offset to the market impact on indexed universal life benefits and higher fees from variable annuity guarantee sales in the prior year where the fees start on the first anniversary date and higher average fee rates. The unearned revenue amortization and the reinsurance accrual offset to the market impact on indexed universal life benefits was a positive $12 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to a negative $4 million for the prior year period. 72AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. ExpensesTotal expenses decreased $197 million, or 4%, to $4.8 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $4.9 billion for the prior year period primarily due to decreases in distribution expenses, interest and debt expense and general and administrative expense. Expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2016 included $51 million of CIE expenses compared to $143 million for the prior year period primarily reflecting the CIE deconsolidation.Distribution expenses decreased $81 million, or 5%, to $1.6 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $1.7 billion for the prior year period driven by lower advisor compensation due to equity market depreciation and lower client activity. See our discussion on the changes in AUM in our segment results of operations section below.Interest credited to fixed accounts decreased $28 million, or 8%, to $304 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $332 million for the prior year period primarily due to lower average fixed annuity account balances and the market impact on indexed universal life benefits, net of hedges. The market impact on indexed universal life benefits, net of hedges was a benefit of $20 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to an expense of $1 million for the prior year period. Average fixed annuity account balances decreased $1.2 billion, or 10%, to $10.5 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the prior year period as older policies continue to lapse and new sales are limited due to low interest rates.Amortization of DAC increased $28 million, or 17%, to $197 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $169 million for the prior year period primarily reflecting the following items:•The impact on DAC from actual versus expected market performance based on our view of bond and equity performance was an expense of $5 million for the first half of 2016 compared to a benefit of $5 million for the prior year period. See additional discussion above in the Overall section.•The DAC offset to the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits (net of hedges and the related DSIC amortization) was an expense of $14 million for the first half of 2016 compared to a benefit of $8 million for the prior year period.Interest and debt expense decreased $65 million, or 38%, to $108 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $173 million for the prior year period primarily due to a $62 million decrease in CIE interest and debt expense reflecting the CIE deconsolidation. General and administrative expenses decreased $54 million, or 3%, to $1.5 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the prior year period primarily due a $30 million decrease in CIE expenses reflecting the CIE deconsolidation, a $9 million sales and use tax reserve release in the first quarter of 2016, an $8 million decrease in compensation related to lower performance fees, lower investment spending and lower performance-based compensation expense, partially offset by $12 million of incremental expense related to the planning and implementation of the new Department of Labor fiduciary standard and $23 million of expense in the second quarter of 2016 from the resolution of a legacy legal matter related to the hedge fund business. Income TaxesOur effective tax rate was 21.0% for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to 22.6% for the prior year period. The effective tax rate for the six months ended June 30, 2016 was lower than the statutory rate as a result of tax preferred items including the dividends received deduction, low income housing tax credits, and lower taxes on net income from foreign subsidiaries. The decrease in the effective tax rate for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the prior year period was primarily due to a $17 million benefit in the second quarter of 2016 primarily related to the completion of tax audits from previous years.73AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC.

Total segment AUM net outflows were $12.2 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2016, which included $6.6 billion of outflows of former parent-related assets. Management expects, consistent with prior patterns of outflows, that outflows of primarily low margin assets directly or indirectly affiliated with Threadneedle and Columbia former parent companies will continue for the foreseeable future. The overall impact to segment results is difficult to quantify due to uncertain timing, volume and mix of the outflows. Global retail funds decreased $4.6 billion, or 2%, during the six months ended June 30, 2016 due to net outflows, distributions and a negative impact of foreign currency translation, partially offset by market appreciation and other. Global retail net outflows of $3.0 billion during the six months ended June 30, 2016 included $1.3 billion of outflows from the Columbia Acorn® Fund, $0.6 billion of outflows from the defined contribution/investment only channel, $0.6 billion of outflows from former parent-related assets (includes $0.1 billion of outflows from the Columbia Acorn® Fund), $0.7 billion of outflows of our variable product funds underlying insurance and annuity separate accounts and UK and European net outflows of $0.9 billion reflecting the uncertainty related to the UK’s decision to leave the EU, partially offset by normal seasonal increases in reinvested dividends. Global institutional AUM decreased $7.7 billion, or 4%, during the six months ended June 30, 2016 due to net outflows of $9.2 billion and an $8.7 billion negative impact of foreign currency translation, partially offset by market appreciation and other. Global institutional net outflows included $1.1 billion of outflows in the first quarter from a third party client that redeemed assets for liquidity purposes, $0.5 billion of outflows related to a CLO unwind, $0.7 billion from the termination of a former subadvisor and $6.0 billion of outflows of former parent-related assets, of which $4.0 billion was driven by changes made to individually managed accounts by a former affiliated distribution partner.

Net RevenuesNet revenues, which exclude net realized investment gains or losses, decreased $176 million, or 11%, to $1.5 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $1.6 billion for the prior year period primarily due to lower management and financial advice fees.77AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. Management and financial advice fees decreased $156 million, or 11%, to $1.2 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $1.4 billion for the prior year period primarily due to lower asset-based fees driven by a decrease in average AUM and a $16 million decrease in performance fees. Average AUM decreased $46.9 billion, or 9%, compared to the prior year period due to net outflows, equity market depreciation and the negative impact of foreign currency translation. Our average weighted equity index, which is a proxy for equity movements on AUM, decreased 6% to 1,472 for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to 1,571 for the prior year period. ExpensesTotal expenses decreased $85 million, or 7%, to $1.2 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $1.3 billion for the prior year period due to a $55 million decrease in distribution expenses from lower retail fund assets and a decrease in general and administrative expense.General and administrative expense decreased $29 million, or 4%, to $645 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $674 million for the prior year period primarily due to an $8 million decrease in compensation related to lower performance fees and lower investment spending, partially offset by a $9 million expense from the resolution of a legacy legal matter related to the hedge fund business.

The impact on DAC, DSIC and reserves for insurance features in non-traditional long-duration contracts from actual versus expected market performance based on our view of bond and equity performance was an expense of $8 million ($4 million for DAC, $1 million for DSIC and $3 million for insurance features in non-traditional long duration contracts) for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to a benefit of $15 million ($4 million for DAC, $1 million for DSIC and $10 million for insurance features in non-traditional long duration contracts) for the prior year period. The primary driver of the year-over-year difference is due to a change in how we are recalibrating expected bond fund returns based on current interest rates and spreads while still assuming ultimate rates and 78AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. spreads do not change from our original expectations. Previously, the difference between actual and expected interest rates directly impacted income in the current period and there would be an offsetting impact during annual unlocking. The prior year benefit reflected favorable equity market and bond fund returns.RiverSource variable annuity account balances decreased 3% to $74.6 billion at June 30, 2016 compared to the prior year period due to net outflows of $1.3 billion and equity market depreciation. RiverSource fixed annuity account balances declined 8% to $10.3 billion at June 30, 2016 compared to the prior year period as older policies continue to lapse and new sales are limited due to low interest rates. Given the current interest rate environment, our current fixed annuity book is expected to gradually run off and earnings on our fixed annuity business will trend down.Net RevenuesNet revenues, which exclude net realized investment gains or losses, decreased $67 million, or 5%, to $1.2 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $1.3 billion for the prior year period primarily due to lower management and financial advice fees and net investment income, partially offset by higher other revenues.Management and financial advice fees decreased $21 million, or 5%, to $361 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $382 million for the prior year period due to lower fees on variable annuities driven by lower average separate account balances. Average variable annuity account balances decreased $4.9 billion, or 7%, from the prior year period due to net outflows and equity market depreciation.Net investment income, which excludes net realized investment gains or losses, decreased $58 million, or 13%, to $381 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $439 million for the prior year period reflecting a decrease of approximately $34 million from lower invested assets due to fixed annuity net outflows and approximately $24 million from lower interest rates.Other revenues increased $16 million, or 7%, to $242 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $226 million for the prior year period due to higher fees from variable annuity guarantee sales in the prior year where the fees start on the first anniversary date and higher average fee rates.ExpensesTotal expenses, which exclude the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits (net of hedges and the related DSIC and DAC amortization) and the DAC and DSIC offset to net realized investment gains or losses, decreased $15 million, or 2%, to $945 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $960 million for the prior year period.Distribution expenses decreased $14 million, or 6%, to $210 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $224 million for the prior year period due to lower variable annuity compensation driven by lower sales and lower average separate account balances. Interest credited to fixed accounts decreased $14 million, or 6%, to $238 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $252 million for the prior year period driven by lower average fixed annuity account balances. Average fixed annuity account balances decreased $1.2 billion, or 10%, to $10.5 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the prior year period as older policies continue to lapse and new sales are limited due to low interest rates.Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses, which exclude the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits (net of hedges and the related DSIC amortization) and the DSIC offset to net realized investment gains or losses, increased $32 million, or 13%, to $282 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $250 million for the prior year period primarily reflecting the following items: •The market impact on reserves for insurance features in non-traditional long-duration contracts was a $3 million expense for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to a $10 million benefit in the prior year period. See additional discussion above in the Overall section.•A $10 million increase in expense related to higher reserve funding driven by the impact of higher fees from variable annuity guarantee sales in the prior year where the fees start on the first anniversary date.•A $5 million increase in reserves for immediate annuities with life contingencies primarily due to higher sales. This impact is mostly offset by an increase in premiums.79AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC.

Interest credited to fixed accounts increased $7 million, or 9%, to $86 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $79 million for the prior year period primarily due to higher average fixed account values.Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses increased $22 million, or 3%, to $770 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $748 million for the prior year period primarily due to a $26 million increase in auto and home expenses reflecting higher incurred losses on current accident year auto business and exposure growth, an $8 million increase in LTC claims and a $7 million favorable impact in the prior year period from a change in the discount rate for DI products, partially offset by a net $14 million LTC 80AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. reserve increase in the prior year period. Catastrophe losses were $60 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $57 million for the prior year period. General and administrative expense increased $11 million, or 9%, to $135 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $124 million for the prior year period primarily due to an increase in staff and investments in our auto and home business.Corporate & OtherThe following table presents the results of operations of our Corporate & Other segment on an operating basis: Six Months Ended June 30, Change 2016 2015 (in millions)  Revenues       Net investment loss$(5) $(17) $12 71 %Other revenues— 9 (9) NMTotal revenues(5) (8) 3 38Banking and deposit interest expense— — — —Total net revenues(5) (8) 3 38Expenses       Interest and debt expense9 9 — —General and administrative expense112 102 10 10Total expenses121 111 10 9Operating loss$(126) $(119) $(7) (6)%NM Not Meaningful.Our Corporate & Other segment pretax operating loss excludes net realized investment gains or losses, the market impact of hedges to offset interest rate changes on unrealized gains or losses for certain investments, integration and restructuring charges, and the impact of consolidating CIEs. Our Corporate & Other segment pretax operating loss increased $7 million, or 6%, to $126 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $119 million for the prior year period primarily due to a decrease in other revenues and an increase in general and administrative expense, partially offset by lower net investment loss. Net investment loss was $5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $17 million for the prior year period primarily reflecting the impact of interest allocation between subsidiaries. Other revenues decreased $9 million compared to the prior year period due to a $4 million loss on the sale of real estate in the second quarter of 2016 and a $7 million gain on the sale of a building in the second quarter of 2015.General and administrative expense increased $10 million, or 10%, to $112 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $102 million for the prior year period primarily due to $12 million of incremental expense related to the planning and implementation of the new Department of Labor fiduciary standard and a $14 million expense from the resolution of a legacy legal matter related to the hedge fund business, partially offset by lower performance-based compensation expense. Market Risk Our primary market risk exposures are interest rate, equity price, foreign currency exchange rate and credit risk. Equity price and interest rate fluctuations can have a significant impact on our results of operations, primarily due to the effects they have on the asset management and other asset-based fees we earn, the spread income generated on our fixed annuities, fixed insurance, brokerage client cash balances, face-amount certificate products and the fixed portion of our variable annuities and variable insurance contracts, the value of DAC and DSIC assets, the value of liabilities for guaranteed benefits associated with our variable annuities and the value of derivatives held to hedge these benefits.Our earnings from fixed annuities, fixed insurance, and the fixed portion of variable annuities and variable insurance contracts are based upon the spread between rates earned on assets held and the rates at which interest is credited to accounts. We primarily invest in fixed rate securities to fund the rate credited to clients. We guarantee an interest rate to the holders of these products. Investment assets and client liabilities generally differ as it relates to basis, repricing or maturity characteristics. Rates credited to clients’ accounts generally reset at shorter intervals than the yield on the underlying investments. Therefore, in an increasing interest rate environment, higher interest rates may be reflected in crediting rates to clients sooner than in rates earned on invested assets, which could result in a reduced spread between the two rates, reduced earned income and a negative impact on pretax income. However, the current low interest rate environment is resulting in interest rates below the level of some of our liability guaranteed minimum interest rates (“GMIRs”). Hence, a modest rise in interest rates would not necessarily result in changes to all the liability credited rates while projected asset purchases would capture the full increase in interest rates. This dynamic would result in widening spreads under a 81AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. modestly rising rate scenario given the current relationship between the current level of interest rates and the underlying GMIRs on the business. As a result of the low interest rate environment, our current reinvestment yields are generally lower than the current portfolio yield. We expect our portfolio income yields to continue to decline in future periods if interest rates remain low. The carrying value and weighted average yield of non-structured fixed maturity securities and commercial mortgage loans that may generate proceeds to reinvest through June 30, 2018 due to prepayment, maturity or call activity at the option of the issuer, excluding securities with a make-whole provision, were $3.7 billion and 4.0%, respectively, as of June 30, 2016. In addition, residential mortgage-backed securities, which are subject to prepayment risk as a result of the low interest rate environment, totaled $6.5 billion and had a weighted average yield of 2.7% as of June 30, 2016. While these amounts represent investments that could be subject to reinvestment risk, it is also possible that these investments will be used to fund liabilities or may not be prepaid and will remain invested at their current yields. In addition to the interest rate environment, the mix of benefit payments versus product sales as well as the timing and volumes associated with such mix may impact our investment yield. Furthermore, reinvestment activities and the associated investment yield may also be impacted by corporate strategies implemented at management’s discretion. The average yield for investment purchases during the six months ended June 30, 2016 was approximately 2.9%.The reinvestment of proceeds from maturities, calls and prepayments at rates below the current portfolio yield, which may be below the level of some liability GMIRs, will have a negative impact to future operating results. To mitigate the unfavorable impact that the low interest rate environment has on our spread income, we assess reinvestment risk in our investment portfolio and monitor this risk in accordance with our asset/liability management framework. In addition, we may reduce the crediting rates on our fixed products when warranted, subject to guaranteed minimums.In addition to the fixed rate exposures noted above, RiverSource Life also has the following variable annuity guarantee benefits: guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits (“GMWB”), guaranteed minimum accumulation benefits (“GMAB”), guaranteed minimum death benefits (“GMDB”) and guaranteed minimum income benefits (“GMIB”). Each of these guaranteed benefits guarantees payouts to the annuity holder under certain specific conditions regardless of the performance of the underlying invested assets.The variable annuity guarantees continue to be managed by utilizing a hedging program which attempts to match the sensitivity of the assets with the sensitivity of the liabilities. This approach works with the premise that matched sensitivities will produce a highly effective hedging result. Our comprehensive hedging program focuses mainly on first order sensitivities of assets and liabilities: Equity Market Level (Delta), Interest Rate Level (Rho) and Volatility (Vega). Additionally, various second order sensitivities are managed. We use various index options across the term structure, interest rate swaps and swaptions, total return swaps and futures to manage the risk exposures. The exposures are measured and monitored daily, and adjustments to the hedge portfolio are made as necessary.We have a macro hedge program to provide protection against the statutory tail scenario risk arising from variable annuity reserves on our statutory surplus and to cover some of the residual risks not covered by other hedging activities. We assess the residual risk under a range of scenarios in creating and executing the macro hedge program. As a means of economically hedging these risks, we use a combination of futures, options, interest rate swaptions and/or swaps. Certain of the macro hedge derivatives used contain settlement provisions linked to both equity returns and interest rates; the remaining are interest rate contracts or equity contracts. The macro hedge program could result in additional earnings volatility as changes in the value of the macro hedge derivatives, which are designed to reduce statutory capital volatility, may not be closely aligned to changes in the variable annuity guarantee embedded derivatives.To evaluate interest rate and equity price risk we perform sensitivity testing which measures the impact on pretax income from the sources listed below for a 12-month period following a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates or a hypothetical 10% decline in equity prices. The interest rate risk test assumes a sudden 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve, with rates then staying at those levels for the next 12 months. The equity price risk test assumes a sudden 10% drop in equity prices, with equity prices then staying at those levels for the next 12 months. In estimating the values of variable annuity riders, equity indexed annuities, stock market certificates, indexed universal life insurance and the associated hedge assets, we assume no change in implied market volatility despite the 10% drop in equity prices.82AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. The following tables present our estimate of the impact on pretax income from the above defined hypothetical market movements as of June 30, 2016:  Equity Price Exposure to Pretax IncomeEquity Price Decline 10% Before Hedge Impact Hedge Impact Net Impact  (in millions)Asset-based management and distribution fees (1) $(228) $5 $(223)DAC and DSIC amortization (2) (3) (124) — (124)Variable annuity riders:      GMDB and GMIB (3) (4) (31) — (31)GMWB (3) (4) (604) 479 (125)GMAB (48) 48 —DAC and DSIC amortization (5) N/A N/A (3)Total variable annuity riders (683) 527 (159)Macro hedge program (6) — 35 35Equity indexed annuities 1 (1) —Certificates 3 (3) —Indexed universal life insurance 34 (26) 8Total $(997) $537 $(463)  Interest Rate Exposure to Pretax IncomeInterest Rate Increase 100 Basis Points Before Hedge Impact Hedge Impact Net Impact  (in millions)Asset-based management and distribution fees (1) $(50) $— $(50)Variable annuity riders:      GMDB and GMIB — — —GMWB 1,274 (1,238) 36GMAB 46 (42) 4DAC and DSIC amortization (5) N/A N/A (4)Total variable annuity riders 1,320 (1,280) 36Macro hedge program (6) — (1) (1)Fixed annuities, fixed insurance and fixed portion of variable annuities and variable insurance products 34 — 34Brokerage client cash balances 152 — 152Certificates (2) — (2)Indexed universal life insurance 66 1 67Total $1,520 $(1,280) $236N/A Not Applicable.(1) Excludes incentive income which is impacted by market and fund performance during the period and cannot be readily estimated.(2) Market impact on DAC and DSIC amortization resulting from lower projected profits.(3) In estimating the impact on DAC and DSIC amortization resulting from lower projected profits, we have not changed our assumed equity asset growth rates. This is a significantly more conservative estimate than if we assumed management follows its mean reversion guideline and increased near-term rates to recover the drop in equity values over a five-year period. We make this same conservative assumption in estimating the impact from GMDB and GMIB riders and the life contingent benefits associated with GMWB.(4) In the second quarter of 2016, we reclassified the estimated impact from certain reserves for life contingent benefits associated with GMWB provisions from the GMDB and GMIB line to the GMWB line. The estimated impact from these reserves as of December 31, 2015 was $(123) million.(5) Market impact on DAC and DSIC amortization related to variable annuity riders is modeled net of hedge impact.(6) The market impact of the macro hedge program is modeled net of any related impact to DAC and DSIC amortization.The above results compare to an estimated negative net impact to pretax income of $417 million related to a 10% equity price decline and an estimated positive net impact to pretax income of $170 million related to a 100 basis point increase in interest rates as of December 31, 2015. 83AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. Net impacts shown in the above table from GMWB and GMAB riders result largely from differences between the liability valuation basis and the hedging basis. Liabilities are valued using fair value accounting principles, with risk margins incorporated in contractholder behavior assumptions and with discount rates increased to reflect a current market estimate of our risk of nonperformance specific to these liabilities. The nonperformance spread risk is not hedged.Actual results could differ materially from those illustrated above as they are based on a number of estimates and assumptions. These include assuming that implied market volatility does not change when equity prices fall by 10%, that management does not increase assumed equity asset growth rates to anticipate recovery of the drop in equity values when valuing DAC, DSIC and GMDB and GMIB liability values and that the 100 basis point increase in interest rates is a parallel shift of the yield curve. Furthermore, we have not tried to anticipate changes in client preferences for different types of assets or other changes in client behavior, nor have we tried to anticipate actions management might take to increase revenues or reduce expenses in these scenarios.The selection of a 100 basis point interest rate increase as well as a 10% equity price decline should not be construed as a prediction of future market events. Impacts of larger or smaller changes in interest rates or equity prices may not be proportional to those shown for a 100 basis point increase in interest rates or a 10% decline in equity prices.Fair Value MeasurementsWe report certain assets and liabilities at fair value; specifically, separate account assets, derivatives, embedded derivatives, properties held by our consolidated property funds, and most investments and cash equivalents. Fair value assumes the exchange of assets or liabilities occurs in orderly transactions and is not the result of a forced liquidation or distressed sale. We include actual market prices, or observable inputs, in our fair value measurements to the extent available. Broker quotes are obtained when quotes from pricing services are not available. We validate prices obtained from third parties through a variety of means such as: price variance analysis, subsequent sales testing, stale price review, price comparison across pricing vendors and due diligence reviews of vendors. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our fair value measurements.Fair Value of Liabilities and Nonperformance RiskCompanies are required to measure the fair value of liabilities at the price that would be received to transfer the liability to a market participant (an exit price). Since there is not a market for our obligations of our variable annuity riders and indexed universal life insurance, we consider the assumptions participants in a hypothetical market would make to reflect an exit price. As a result, we adjust the valuation of variable annuity riders and indexed universal life insurance by updating certain contractholder assumptions, adding explicit margins to provide for profit, risk and expenses, and adjusting the rates used to discount expected cash flows to reflect a current market estimate of our nonperformance risk. The nonperformance risk adjustment is based on observable market data adjusted to estimate the risk of our life insurance company subsidiaries not fulfilling these liabilities. Consistent with general market conditions, this estimate resulted in a spread over the LIBOR swap curve as of June 30, 2016. As our estimate of this spread widens or tightens, the liability will decrease or increase. If this nonperformance credit spread moves to a zero spread over the LIBOR swap curve, the reduction to net income would be approximately $418 million, net of DAC, DSIC, unearned revenue amortization, the reinsurance accrual and income taxes (calculated at the statutory tax rate of 35%), based on June 30, 2016 credit spreads.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesOverviewWe maintained substantial liquidity during the six months ended June 30, 2016. At June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had $2.8 billion and $2.4 billion, respectively, in cash and cash equivalents excluding CIEs. We have additional liquidity available through an unsecured revolving credit facility for up to $500 million that expires in May 2020. Under the terms of the credit agreement, we can increase this facility to $750 million upon satisfaction of certain approval requirements. Available borrowings under this facility are reduced by any outstanding letters of credit. At June 30, 2016, we had no outstanding borrowings under this credit facility and had $1 million of outstanding letters of credit. Our credit facility contains various administrative, reporting, legal and financial covenants. We were in compliance with all such covenants at June 30, 2016. During the first quarter of 2016, we extinguished $16 million of our junior subordinated notes due 2066 in open market transactions and recognized a gain of less than $1 million. On June 1, 2016, we redeemed our remaining outstanding junior subordinated notes due 2066 at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal balance of the notes plus accrued and compounded interest.We enter into short-term borrowings, which may include repurchase agreements and Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) advances, to reduce reinvestment risk. Short-term borrowings allow us to receive cash to reinvest in longer-duration assets, while paying back the short-term debt with cash flows generated by the fixed income portfolio. The balance of repurchase agreements at both June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was $50 million, which is collateralized with agency residential mortgage backed securities and commercial mortgage backed securities from our investment portfolio. Our subsidiary, RiverSource Life Insurance Company (“RiverSource Life”), is a member of the FHLB of Des Moines, which provides access to collateralized borrowings. As of both June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had $150 million of borrowings from the FHLB, which is collateralized with commercial mortgage backed securities. We believe cash flows from operating activities, available cash balances and our availability of revolver borrowings will be sufficient to fund our operating liquidity needs.84AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. Dividends from SubsidiariesAmeriprise Financial is primarily a parent holding company for the operations carried out by our wholly owned subsidiaries. Because of our holding company structure, our ability to meet our cash requirements, including the payment of dividends on our common stock, substantially depends upon the receipt of dividends or return of capital from our subsidiaries, particularly our life insurance subsidiary, RiverSource Life, our face-amount certificate subsidiary, Ameriprise Certificate Company (“ACC”), AMPF Holding Corporation, which is the parent company of our retail introducing broker-dealer subsidiary, Ameriprise Financial Services, Inc. (“AFSI”) and our clearing broker-dealer subsidiary, American Enterprise Investment Services, Inc. (“AEIS”), our Auto and Home insurance subsidiary, IDS Property Casualty Insurance Company (“IDS Property Casualty”), doing business as Ameriprise Auto & Home Insurance, our transfer agent subsidiary, Columbia Management Investment Services Corp., our investment advisory company, Columbia Management Investment Advisers, LLC, and Threadneedle Asset Management Holdings Sàrl. The payment of dividends by many of our subsidiaries is restricted and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to regulatory capital requirements.Actual capital and regulatory capital requirements for our wholly owned subsidiaries subject to regulatory capital requirements were as follows: Actual Capital Regulatory Capital Requirements June 30, 2016 December 31, 2015June 30, 2016 December 31, 2015 (in millions)RiverSource Life(1)(2)$3,802 $3,800 N/A $589RiverSource Life of NY(1)(2)345 333 N/A 44IDS Property Casualty(1)(3)736 684 214 214Ameriprise Insurance Company(1)(3)48 46 2 2ACC(4)(5)307 274 288 258Threadneedle Asset Management Holdings Sàrl(6)394 285 163 165Ameriprise National Trust Bank(7)24 36 10 10AFSI(3)(4)123 93 # #Ameriprise Captive Insurance Company(3)50 54 16 11Ameriprise Trust Company(3)28 27 23 22AEIS(3)(4)132 110 22 52RiverSource Distributors, Inc.(3)(4)15 15 # #Columbia Management Investment Distributors, Inc.(3)(4)17 17 # #N/A Not applicable.# Amounts are less than $1 million.(1) Actual capital is determined on a statutory basis.(2) Regulatory capital requirement is based on the statutory risk-based capital filing.(3) Regulatory capital requirement is based on the applicable regulatory requirement, calculated as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.(4) Actual capital is determined on an adjusted GAAP basis.(5) ACC is required to hold capital in compliance with the Minnesota Department of Commerce and SEC capital requirements.(6) Actual capital and regulatory capital requirements are determined in accordance with U.K. regulatory legislation. The regulatory capital requirements at June 30, 2016 represent calculations at December 31, 2015 of the rule based requirements, as specified by FCA regulations.(7) Ameriprise National Trust Bank is required to maintain capital in compliance with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency regulations and policies.In addition to the particular regulations restricting dividend payments and establishing subsidiary capitalization requirements, we take into account the overall health of the business, capital levels and risk management considerations in determining a dividend strategy for payments to our parent holding company from our subsidiaries, and in deciding to use cash to make capital contributions to our subsidiaries.During the six months ended June 30, 2016, the parent holding company received cash dividends or a return of capital from its subsidiaries of $896 million (including $600 million from RiverSource Life) and contributed cash to its subsidiaries of $114 million (including $75 million to IDS Property Casualty). During the six months ended June 30, 2015, the parent holding company received cash dividends or a return of capital from its subsidiaries of $919 million (including $525 million from RiverSource Life) and contributed cash to its subsidiaries of $214 million (including $175 million to IDS Property Casualty).85AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. Dividends Paid to Shareholders and Share Repurchases We paid regular quarterly dividends to our shareholders totaling $244 million and $234 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. On July 26, 2016, we announced a quarterly dividend of $0.75 per common share. The dividend will be paid on August 19, 2016 to our shareholders of record at the close of business on August 8, 2016.In April 2014, our Board of Directors authorized an expenditure of up to $2.5 billion for the repurchase of shares of our common stock through April 28, 2016, which was exhausted in the three months ended March 31, 2016. In December 2015, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase up to an additional $2.5 billion of our common stock through December 31, 2017. As of June 30, 2016, we had $1.7 billion remaining under our share repurchase authorization. We intend to fund share repurchases through existing working capital, future earnings and other customary financing methods. The share repurchase programs do not require the purchase of any minimum number of shares, and depending on market conditions and other factors, these purchases may be commenced or suspended at any time without prior notice. Acquisitions under the share repurchase programs may be made in the open market, through privately negotiated transactions or block trades or other means. During the six months ended June 30, 2016, we repurchased a total of 9.8 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $91.57 per share.Cash Flows Cash flows of CIEs are reflected in our cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities, investing activities and financing activities. Cash held by CIEs is not available for general use by Ameriprise Financial, nor is Ameriprise Financial cash available for general use by its CIEs. As such, the operating, investing and financing cash flows of the CIEs have no impact to the change in cash and cash equivalents.Operating ActivitiesNet cash provided by operating activities decreased $187 million to $1.3 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $1.5 billion for the prior year period primarily due to a $115 million decrease in net cash flows from investment properties and other assets and liabilities of CIEs primarily reflecting the CIE deconsolidation and a $95 million increase in income taxes paid, net.Investing ActivitiesOur investing activities primarily relate to our Available-for-Sale investment portfolio. Further, this activity is significantly affected by the net flows of our investment certificate, fixed annuity and universal life products reflected in financing activities.Net cash provided by investing activities was $63 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to net cash used in investing activities of $182 million for the prior year period primarily reflecting a $238 million increase in proceeds from sales, maturities and repayments of mortgage loans reflecting the sale of a portion of our consumer loans in the first quarter of 2016, a $258 million increase in proceeds from sales of Available-for-Sale securities, and a $525 million increase in net cash related to changes in investments of CIEs, partially offset by a $772 million increase in cash used for purchases of Available-for-Sale securities.Financing ActivitiesNet cash used in financing activities decreased $513 million to $908 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $1.4 billion for the prior year period. Net cash inflows related to investment certificates increased $423 million compared to the prior year period due to higher proceeds from additions, partially offset by higher maturities, withdrawals and cash surrenders. Cash outflows from surrenders and other benefits of policyholder account balances decreased $577 million compared to the prior year period. During the six months ended June 30, 2016, we repaid the remaining $245 million of our junior subordinated notes due 2066. Net cash outflows related to noncontrolling interests decreased $194 million compared to the prior year period. Net cash outflows related to borrowings of CIEs was $60 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to net cash inflows of $507 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015.Contractual CommitmentsThere have been no material changes to our contractual obligations disclosed in our 2015 10-K. Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe provide asset management services to investment entities which are considered to be VIEs, such as CLOs, hedge funds, property funds and private equity funds, which are sponsored by us. We consolidate certain CLOs. We have determined that consolidation is not required for certain CLOs, hedge funds, property funds and private equity funds which are sponsored by us. Prior to January 1, 2016, we consolidated property funds. Our maximum exposure to loss with respect to our investment in these non-consolidated entities is limited to our carrying value. We have no obligation to provide further financial or other support to these investment entities nor have we provided any support to these investment entities. See Note 2 and Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our arrangements with these investment entities.86AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS The information set forth in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 is incorporated herein by reference.ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS We are including the following revised risk factor, which should be read in conjunction with our description of risk factors provided in Part I, Item 1A of our 2015 10-K and in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2016.Changes in and the adoption of accounting standards or inaccurate estimates or assumptions in applying accounting policies could have a material impact on our financial statements and changes in the regulation of independent registered public accounting firms are present with increasing frequency in connection with broader market reforms. Our accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. Some of these policies require use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported value of our assets or liabilities and results of operations and are critical because they require management to make difficult, subjective, and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain. If those assumptions, estimates or judgments were incorrectly made, we could be required to correct and restate prior period financial statements.We prepare our financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. From time to time, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the SEC and other regulators may change the financial accounting and reporting standards governing the preparation of our financial statements. In addition, the conduct of our independent registered public accounting firm is overseen by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. These and other regulators may make additional inquiries regarding, or change their application of, existing laws and regulations regarding our independent auditor, financial statements or other financial reports and the possibility of such additional inquiries or changes is increasing in frequency in connection with broader market reforms. These changes are difficult to predict, and could impose additional governance, internal control and disclosure demands. In some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in our restating prior period financial statements. It is possible that the changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. For example, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (“PwC”) informed us that it has identified a potential issue related to its independence under Rule 2-01(c)(1)(ii)(A) of Regulation S-X (referred to as the “Loan Rule”). The Loan Rule prohibits accounting firms, such as PwC, from being deemed independent if they have certain financial relationships with their audit clients or certain affiliates of those clients. Pursuant to the SEC’s application of the Loan Rule, PwC has advised us that certain relationships between PwC and its lenders who also are record owners of various funds in the Columbia Threadneedle family of funds (collectively, the “Columbia Threadneedle Funds”) or certain other entities within the Ameriprise Financial, Inc. investment company complex, may implicate the Loan Rule. On June 20, 2016, the Staff of the SEC issued a “no-action” letter confirming that it would not recommend that the SEC commence enforcement action against an unrelated fund that relied on audit services performed by an audit firm that was not in compliance with the Loan Rule in certain specified circumstances. The SEC Staff stated that the relief under the letter is temporary and will expire 18 months after the issuance of the letter. If it was determined that PwC was not independent, or we do not receive some form of exemptive relief, among other things, the financial statements audited by PwC and the interim financial statements reviewed by PwC may have to be audited and reviewed, respectively, by another independent registered public accounting firm. PwC has advised us that, based on its knowledge and analyses of our facts and circumstances, it is not aware of any facts that would preclude reliance by us, our affiliates and other entities within the Ameriprise Financial, Inc. investment company complex on the no-action letter. PwC has also affirmed to us that they are able to exercise objective and impartial judgment in their audits of us, our affiliates and the Columbia Threadneedle Funds, are independent accountants within the meaning of PCAOB Rule 3520 and in their view can continue to serve as our independent registered public accounting firm.89AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC.
