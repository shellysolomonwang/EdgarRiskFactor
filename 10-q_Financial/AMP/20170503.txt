Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2016 10-K and other factors as discussed herein.Equity price, credit market and interest rate fluctuations can have a significant impact on our results of operations, primarily due to the effects they have on the asset management and other asset-based fees we earn, the “spread” income generated on our fixed annuities, fixed insurance, deposit products and the fixed portion of variable annuities and variable insurance contracts, the value of deferred acquisition costs (“DAC”) and deferred sales inducement costs (“DSIC”) assets, the values of liabilities for guaranteed benefits associated with our variable annuities and the values of derivatives held to hedge these benefits.Earnings, as well as operating earnings, will continue to be negatively impacted by the ongoing low interest rate environment. In addition to continuing spread compression in our interest sensitive product lines, a sustained low interest rate environment may result in increases to our reserves and changes in various rate assumptions we use to amortize DAC and DSIC, which may negatively impact our operating earnings. For additional discussion on our interest rate risk, see Item 3. “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.”We consolidate certain variable interest entities for which we provide asset management services. These entities are defined as consolidated investment entities (“CIEs”). While the consolidation of the CIEs impacts our balance sheet and income statement, our exposure to these entities is unchanged and there is no impact to the underlying business results. For further information on CIEs, see Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. The results of operations of the CIEs are reflected in the Corporate & Other segment. On a consolidated basis, the management fees we earn for the services we provide to the CIEs and the related general and administrative expenses are eliminated and the changes in the fair value of assets and liabilities related to the CIEs, primarily syndicated loans and debt, are reflected in net investment income. We continue to include the fees from these entities in the management and financial advice fees line within our Asset Management segment. While our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), management believes that operating measures, which exclude net realized investment gains or losses, net of the related DSIC and DAC amortization, unearned revenue amortization and the reinsurance accrual; the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits, net of hedges and the related DSIC and DAC amortization; the market impact on indexed universal life benefits, net of hedges and the related DAC amortization, unearned revenue amortization and the reinsurance accrual; the market impact of hedges to offset interest rate changes on unrealized gains or losses for certain investments; integration and restructuring charges; and the impact of consolidating CIEs, best reflect the underlying performance of our core operations and facilitate a more meaningful trend analysis. Management uses certain of these non-GAAP measures to evaluate our financial performance on a basis comparable to that used by 49AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. some securities analysts and investors. Also, certain of these non-GAAP measures are taken into consideration, to varying degrees, for purposes of business planning and analysis and for certain compensation-related matters. Throughout our Management’s Discussion and Analysis, these non-GAAP measures are referred to as operating measures. These non-GAAP measures should not be viewed as a substitute for U.S. GAAP measures.It is management’s priority to increase shareholder value over a multi-year horizon by achieving our on-average, over-time financial targets.Our financial targets are:•Operating total net revenue growth of 6% to 8%,•Operating earnings per diluted share growth of 12% to 15%, and•Operating return on equity excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) of 19% to 23%.The following tables reconcile our GAAP measures to operating measures:  Three Months Ended March 31,2017 2016(in millions)Total net revenues$2,901 $2,765Less: Revenue attributable to CIEs22 24Less: Net realized investment gains (losses)17 (16)Less: Market impact on indexed universal life benefits1 9Less: Market impact of hedges on investments1 (40)Operating total net revenues$2,860 $2,788 Three Months Ended March 31, Per Diluted ShareThree Months Ended March 31,2017 20162017 2016(in millions, except per share amounts)Net income$403 $364 $2.52 $2.09Less: Net income (loss) attributable to CIEs1 (1) 0.01 —Add: Market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits (1)63 (17) 0.40 (0.09)Add: Market impact on indexed universal life benefits (1)— (19) — (0.11)Add: Market impact of hedges on investments (1)(1) 40 (0.01) 0.23Less: Net realized investment gains (losses) (1)16 (16) 0.10 (0.09)Tax effect of adjustments (2)(16) (7) (0.10) (0.04)Operating earnings$432 $378 $2.70 $2.17        Weighted average common shares outstanding:       Basic157.5 172.6    Diluted160.1 174.4    (1) Pretax operating adjustments.(2) Calculated using the statutory tax rate of 35%.50AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC.

After-tax is calculated using the statutory rate of 35%.The Department of Labor published regulations in April 2016 that would expand the scope of who is considered an ERISA fiduciary and these regulations focus in large part on investment recommendations made by financial advisors, registered investment advisors, and other investment professionals to retirement investors, how financial advisors are able to discuss IRA rollovers, as well as how financial advisors and affiliates can transact with retirement investors. Tax qualified accounts, particularly IRAs, make up a significant portion of our assets under management and administration. While effective on June 7, 2016, these regulations are not scheduled to begin to be applicable until June 9, 2017, with full applicability of all requirements scheduled for January 1, 2018. As of February 3, 2017, per various memoranda and statements issued by President Trump and the Department of Labor, these regulations were under review by the Department of Labor. As a result, it is unclear whether the Department of Labor will substantially rescind or revise the regulations as adopted in 2016. In light of the uncertainty regarding the fiduciary regulation, while we prudently continue to prepare to comply with the Department of Labor’s investment fiduciary regulations and exemptions in the form in which they were adopted in April 2016, we are also evaluating the impact to our clients, financial advisors and business should the Department of Labor decide to delay, rescind or revise the regulations per the developments since President Trump’s inauguration as generally described above. Critical Accounting EstimatesThe accounting and reporting policies that we use affect our Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of our accounting and reporting policies are critical to an understanding of our consolidated results of operations and financial condition and, in some cases, the application of these policies can be significantly affected by the estimates, judgments and assumptions made by management during the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements. These accounting policies are discussed in detail in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis — Critical Accounting Estimates” in our 2016 10-K.Recent Accounting PronouncementsFor information regarding recent accounting pronouncements and their expected impact on our future consolidated results of operations and financial condition, see Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.51AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. Assets Under Management and AdministrationAssets under management (“AUM”) include external client assets for which we provide investment management services, such as the assets of the Columbia Threadneedle funds, assets of institutional clients and assets of clients in our advisor platform held in wrap accounts as well as assets managed by sub-advisers selected by us. AUM also includes certain assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets for which we provide investment management services and recognize management fees in our Asset Management segment, such as the assets of the general account and the variable product funds held in the separate accounts of our life insurance subsidiaries and CIEs. These assets do not include assets under advisement, for which we provide model portfolios but do not have full discretionary investment authority. Corporate & Other AUM primarily includes former bank assets that are managed within our Corporate & Other segment.Assets under administration (“AUA”) include assets for which we provide administrative services such as client assets invested in other companies’ products that we offer outside of our wrap accounts. These assets include those held in clients’ brokerage accounts. We generally record revenues received from administered assets as distribution fees. We do not exercise management discretion over these assets and do not earn a management fee. These assets are not reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. AUA also includes certain assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets for which we do not provide investment management services and do not recognize management fees, such as investments in non-affiliated funds held in the separate accounts of our life insurance subsidiaries. These assets do not include assets under advisement, for which we provide model portfolios but do not have full discretionary investment authority.The following table presents detail regarding our AUM and AUA: March 31, Change2017 2016(in billions)  Assets Under Management and Administration       Advice & Wealth Management AUM$211.7 $182.3 $29.4 16 %Asset Management AUM467.0 464.1 2.9 1Corporate & Other AUM0.3 0.4 (0.1) (25)Eliminations(24.6) (23.2) (1.4) (6)Total Assets Under Management654.4 623.6 30.8 5Total Assets Under Administration163.2 149.1 14.1 9Total AUM and AUA$817.6 $772.7 $44.9 6 %Total AUM increased $30.8 billion, or 5%, to $654.4 billion as of March 31, 2017 compared to $623.6 billion as of March 31, 2016 primarily due to a $29.4 billion increase in Advice & Wealth Management AUM driven by wrap account net inflows and market appreciation.

Net realized investment gains (net of the related DSIC and DAC amortization) were $16 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to net realized investment losses (net of the related DSIC and DAC amortization) of $16 million for the prior year period. The market impact of hedges on investments was a benefit of $1 million compared to an expense of $40 million for the prior year period.The market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits (net of hedges and the related DSIC and DAC amortization) was an expense of $63 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to a benefit of $17 million for the prior year period. The market impact on indexed universal life benefits (net of hedges and the related DAC amortization, unearned revenue amortization and the reinsurance accrual) was nil for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to a benefit of $19 million for the prior year period.The impact on DAC, DSIC and reserves for insurance features in non-traditional long-duration contracts from actual versus expected market performance based on our view of bond and equity performance was a benefit of $19 million ($9 million for DAC, $2 million for DSIC and $8 million for insurance features in non-traditional long duration contracts) for the three months ended March 31, 2017 reflecting favorable equity market returns compared to an expense of $10 million ($6 million for DAC, $1 million for DSIC and $3 million for insurance features in non-traditional long duration contracts) for the prior year period.53AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. Net RevenuesNet revenues increased $136 million, or 5%, to $2.9 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to $2.8 billion for the prior year period primarily due to market appreciation, wrap account net inflows and an increase in net investment income, partially offset by a $34 million decrease in net revenues from the impact of transitioning advisory accounts to share classes without 12b-1 fees, asset management net outflows and lower premiums. Management and financial advice fees increased $96 million, or 7%, to $1.5 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to $1.4 billion for the prior year period primarily due to market appreciation, partially offset by a $14 million negative impact of one fewer fee day, an $11 million decrease in performance fees and a $14 million negative impact of foreign exchange. Average AUM increased $29.7 billion, or 5%, compared to the prior year period due to market appreciation and wrap account net inflows, partially offset by asset management net outflows and the negative impact of foreign currency translation. See our discussion on the changes in AUM in our segment results of operations section. Net investment income increased $60 million, or 18%, to $391 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to $331 million for the prior year period due to a $41 million favorable change in the market impact of hedges on investments and net realized investment gains of $17 million for the first quarter of 2017 compared to net realized investment losses of $16 million for the prior year period. Premiums decreased $29 million, or 8%, to $339 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to $368 million for the prior year period primarily reflecting higher ceded premiums due to new quota share reinsurance arrangements we entered into at the beginning of the year to reduce risk. ExpensesTotal expenses increased $136 million, or 6%, to $2.4 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to $2.3 billion for the prior year period primarily due to the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits (net of hedges and the related DSIC and DAC amortization) and higher distribution expenses from increased advisor productivity, as well as an increase in general and administrative expense.Distribution expenses increased $53 million, or 7%, to $823 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to $770 million for the prior year period reflecting market appreciation, partially offset by a $25 million decrease from changes related to our transition to share classes without 12b-1 fees in advisory accounts. Interest credited to fixed accounts increased $16 million, or 11%, to $162 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to $146 million for the prior year period due to the market impact on indexed universal life benefits, net of hedges, which was nil for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to a benefit of $16 million for the prior year period. Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses increased $85 million, or 18%, to $567 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to $482 million for the prior year period primarily reflecting the following items:•A $9 million increase in expense related to higher reserve funding driven by the impact of higher fees from variable annuity guarantee sales in the prior year where the fees start on the first anniversary date.•A $10 million negative impact in the first quarter of 2017 from changes in assumptions in the third quarter unlocking process that result in ongoing increases to living benefit reserves. •The impact on DSIC and reserves for insurance features in non-traditional long-duration contracts from actual versus expected market performance based on our view of bond and equity performance was a benefit of $10 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 reflecting favorable equity market returns compared to an expense of $4 million for the prior year period.•A $30 million decrease in benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses related to our auto and home business reflecting a lower non-catastrophe loss ratio and the impact of new quota share reinsurance arrangements.•A $284 million increase in expense compared to the prior year period from the unhedged nonperformance credit spread risk adjustment on variable annuity guaranteed benefits. As the embedded derivative liability on which the nonperformance credit spread is applied increases (decreases), the impact of the nonperformance credit spread is favorable (unfavorable) to expense. The unfavorable impact of the nonperformance credit spread was $65 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to a favorable impact of $219 million for the prior year period.•A $179 million decrease in expense from other market impacts on variable annuity guaranteed benefits, net of hedges in place to offset those risks and the related DSIC amortization. This decrease was the result of a favorable $1.4 billion change in the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits reserves, an unfavorable $1.2 billion change in the market impact on derivatives hedging the variable annuity guaranteed benefits and a favorable $2 million change in the DSIC offset. The main market drivers contributing to these changes are summarized below:•Interest rate impact on the variable annuity guaranteed living benefits liability net of the impact on the corresponding hedge assets resulted in a lower expense in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the prior year period.•Equity market impact on the variable annuity guaranteed living benefits liability net of the impact on the corresponding hedge assets resulted in a benefit in the first quarter of 2017 compared to an expense in the prior year period.54AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. •Volatility impact on the variable annuity guaranteed living benefits liability net of the impact on the corresponding hedge assets resulted in a higher expense in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the prior year period.•Other unhedged items, including the difference between the assumed and actual underlying separate account investment performance, fixed income credit exposures, transaction costs and various behavioral items, were a net favorable impact compared to the prior year period.Amortization of DAC decreased $38 million, or 35%, to $72 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to $110 million for the prior year period primarily reflecting the following items:•The impact on DAC from actual versus expected market performance based on our view of bond and equity performance was a benefit of $9 million for the first quarter of 2017 reflecting favorable equity market returns compared to an expense of $6 million for the prior year period.•The DAC offset to the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits (net of hedges and the related DSIC amortization) was a benefit of $9 million for the first quarter of 2017 compared to an expense of $16 million for the prior year period.General and administrative expenses increased $25 million, or 3%, to $752 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to $727 million for the prior year period due to a $9 million expense related to the renegotiation of a vendor arrangement, a $5 million increase in expense related to planning and implementation of the new Department of Labor fiduciary standard, higher performance based compensation and a $9 million sales and use tax reserve release in the first quarter of 2016, partially offset by a positive impact of foreign exchange. Income TaxesOur effective tax rate was 15.2% for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to 23.3% for the prior year period. Our effective tax rates for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 are lower than the statutory rate as a result of tax preferred items including the dividends received deduction, low income housing tax credits, and lower taxes on net income from foreign subsidiaries. The decrease in the effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the prior year period is primarily due to a $28 million benefit for stock compensation due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2016-09 Stock Compensation - Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting as well as a $20 million benefit for a reversal of a tax reserve related to prior years.55AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. Results of Operations by Segment for the Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 Operating earnings is the measure of segment profit or loss management uses to evaluate segment performance. Operating earnings should not be viewed as a substitute for GAAP pretax income. We believe the presentation of segment operating earnings as we measure it for management purposes enhances the understanding of our business by reflecting the underlying performance of our core operations and facilitating a more meaningful trend analysis. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the presentation of segment results and our definition of operating earnings.Beginning in the first quarter of 2017, the long term care business, which had been reported as part of the Protection segment, is reflected in the Corporate & Other segment. We discontinued underwriting long term care insurance in 2002 and the transfer of this closed block to the Corporate & Other segment allows investors to better understand the performance of our on-going Protection businesses. Prior periods presented have been restated to reflect the change.

Advice & Wealth ManagementIn April 2017, we announced a definitive agreement to acquire Investment Professionals, Inc. (“IPI”), an independent broker dealer specializing in the on-site delivery of investment programs for financial institutions, including banks and credit unions. IPI had approximately 200 advisors and $8 billion in assets at December 31, 2016.

Our Advice & Wealth Management segment pretax operating earnings, which exclude net realized investment gains or losses, increased $43 million, or 21%, to $248 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to $205 million for the prior year period reflecting wrap account net inflows, market appreciation and higher earnings on brokerage cash. Pretax operating margin was 19.2% for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to 17.1% for the prior year period.Net RevenuesNet revenues exclude net realized investment gains or losses. Net revenues increased $97 million, or 8%, to $1.3 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to $1.2 billion for the prior year period primarily due to growth in wrap account assets, higher earnings on brokerage cash and increased transactional activity, partially offset by lower 12b-1 fees. During the quarter, we completed our transition to share classes without 12b-1 fees in advisory accounts, which reduced revenue by $34 million. Operating net revenue per branded advisor increased to $134,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2017, up 9%, from $123,000 for the prior year period. Total branded advisors were 9,668 at March 31, 2017 compared to 9,766 at March 31, 2016. Management and financial fees increased $91 million, or 14%, to $722 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to $631 million for the prior year period due to growth in wrap account assets. Average advisory wrap account assets increased $28.8 billion, or 16%, compared to the prior year period primarily reflecting net inflows and market appreciation.Distribution fees were flat at $513 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to $514 million for the prior year period reflecting market appreciation, increased transactional activity and higher brokerage cash spread due to an increase in short-term interest rates, offset by lower 12b-1 fees.ExpensesTotal expenses increased $54 million, or 5%, to $1.0 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to $993 million for the prior year period primarily due to an increase in distribution expenses.Distribution expenses increased $45 million, or 6%, to $777 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to $732 million for the prior year period reflecting higher advisor compensation due to growth in wrap account assets and increased transactional activity, partially offset by a $25 million decrease from reduced advisor compensation related to our transition to share classes without 12b-1 fees in advisory accounts.Asset ManagementVoluntary fee waivers we provided to the Columbia Money Market Funds were not material for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016.The following tables present the mutual fund performance of our retail Columbia and Threadneedle funds as of March 31:ColumbiaMutual Fund Rankings in top 2 Lipper Quartiles2017 2016Domestic EquityEqual weighted1 year69% 68%  3 year75% 62%  5 year71% 57% Asset weighted1 year67% 80%  3 year79% 74%  5 year79% 68%International EquityEqual weighted1 year45% 55%  3 year55% 68%  5 year70% 60% Asset weighted1 year33% 37%  3 year44% 39%  5 year48% 41%Taxable Fixed IncomeEqual weighted1 year78% 63%  3 year76% 59%  5 year82% 71% Asset weighted1 year70% 70%  3 year83% 77%  5 year88% 83%58AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC.

Further, in March 2017 the UK invoked article 50 of the Treaty of Lisbon in serving its relevant notice to leave the European Union on March 30, 2019. The full impact of the British exit from the EU (commonly known as “Brexit”) remains uncertain. This uncertainty, which is expected to last for a lengthy period of time, has had and may continue to have a negative impact on our UK and European net flows and foreign currency translation resulting from the weakening of the British Pound.Total segment AUM increased $12.6 billion, or 3%, during the three months ended March 31, 2017 driven by market appreciation, partially offset by net outflows. Total segment AUM net outflows were $5.6 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2017, which included $2.4 billion of outflows of former parent-related assets. Management expects, consistent with prior patterns of outflows, that outflows of primarily low margin assets directly or indirectly affiliated with Threadneedle and Columbia former parent companies will continue for the foreseeable future. The overall impact to segment results is difficult to quantify due to uncertain timing, volume and mix of the outflows. Global retail net outflows of $3.9 billion included $0.9 billion of outflows of our variable product funds underlying insurance and annuity separate accounts and $0.9 billion of outflows from former parent-related assets. Retail net outflows in the quarter were consistent with industry outflows in active strategies and improving trends among UK and European investors 61AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. following the Brexit vote disruption. Global institutional net outflows, excluding former parent assets, included inflows of several large mandates that funded during the quarter that had been anticipated, that were offset by a $1.1 billion outflow from an institutional client that continued a pattern of redeeming assets for liquidity purposes that started in 2015.

Net RevenuesNet revenues, which exclude net realized investment gains or losses, were flat at $726 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to $724 million for the prior year period reflecting market appreciation offset by one less fee day in the quarter, net outflows, lower performance fees and foreign exchange translation.Management and financial advice fees decreased $4 million, or 1%, to $598 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to $602 million for the prior year period driven by cumulative net outflows from our higher fee yielding retail funds, a $15 million negative foreign currency translation impact related to our UK and European AUM, an $11 million decrease in performance fees and an $8 million negative impact from one less fee day in the quarter, partially offset by market appreciation. Our average weighted equity index, which is a proxy for equity movements on AUM, increased 19% for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the prior year period. Distribution fees increased $4 million, or 3%, to $121 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to $117 million for the prior year period due to market appreciation, partially offset by cumulative net outflows.ExpensesTotal expenses were flat at $576 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to $575 million for the prior year period due to higher distribution expenses offset by lower general and administrative expense. Distribution expenses increased $10 million, or 4%, to $257 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to $247 million for the prior year period due to higher compensation driven by market appreciation, partially offset by cumulative net outflows and a $4 million positive impact from one less fee day in the quarter. General and administrative expense decreased $8 million, or 3%, to $310 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to $318 million for the prior year period due to a $5 million decrease in compensation related to performance fees and an $11 million benefit from the impact of foreign exchange, partially offset by higher performance based compensation. 62AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC.

The impact on DAC, DSIC and reserves for insurance features in non-traditional long-duration contracts from actual versus expected market performance based on our view of bond and equity performance was a benefit of $18 million ($8 million for DAC, $2 million for DSIC and $8 million for insurance features in non-traditional long duration contracts) for the three months ended March 31, 2017 reflecting favorable equity market returns compared to an expense of $9 million ($5 million for DAC, $1 million for DSIC and $3 million for insurance features in non-traditional long duration contracts) for the prior year period.RiverSource variable annuity account balances increased 3% to $76.4 billion at March 31, 2017 compared to the prior year period due to equity market appreciation, partially offset by net outflows of $3.0 billion. Lapse rates were higher in the quarter, reflecting increased client asset transfers from variable annuities to fee-based investment advisory accounts, as well as from run-off of a closed block of policies distributed through third-parties. RiverSource fixed annuity account balances declined 7% to $9.8 billion at March 31, 2017 compared to the prior year period as older policies continue to lapse and new sales are limited due to low interest rates. Given the current interest rate environment, our current fixed annuity book is expected to gradually run off and earnings on our fixed annuity business will trend down.Net RevenuesNet revenues, which exclude net realized investment gains or losses, increased $12 million, or 2%, to $608 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to $596 million for the prior year period due to equity market appreciation and an increase in variable annuity rider fees, partially offset by lower investment yields and net outflows in fixed and variable annuities.Management and financial advice fees increased $10 million, or 6%, to $187 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to $177 million for the prior year period due to higher fees on variable annuities driven by higher average separate account balances. Average variable annuity account balances increased $3.8 billion, or 6%, from the prior year period due to market appreciation, partially offset by net outflows.63AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. Net investment income, which excludes net realized investment gains or losses, decreased $13 million, or 7%, to $179 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to $192 million for the prior year period reflecting a decrease of approximately $10 million from lower interest rates and approximately $3 million from lower invested assets due to fixed annuity net outflows.Other revenues increased $12 million, or 10%, to $128 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to $116 million for the prior year period due to higher fees from variable annuity guarantee sales in the prior year where the fees start on the first anniversary date and higher average fee rates.ExpensesTotal expenses, which exclude the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits (net of hedges and the related DSIC and DAC amortization) and the DAC and DSIC offset to net realized investment gains or losses, decreased $3 million, or 1%, to $469 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to $472 million for the prior year period. Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses, which exclude the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits (net of hedges and the related DSIC amortization) and the DSIC offset to net realized investment gains or losses, decreased $1 million to $143 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to $144 million for the prior year period primarily reflecting the following items: •The impact on DSIC and reserves for insurance features in non-traditional long-duration contracts from actual versus expected market performance based on our view of bond and equity performance was a benefit of $10 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 reflecting favorable equity market returns compared to an expense of $4 million for the prior year period.•A $9 million increase in expense related to higher reserve funding driven by the impact of higher fees from variable annuity guarantee sales in the prior year where the fees start on the first anniversary date.•A $10 million negative impact in the first quarter of 2017 from changes in assumptions in the third quarter unlocking process that result in ongoing increases to living benefit reserves. Amortization of DAC increased $2 million, or 4%, to $47 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to $45 million for the prior year period primarily due to a negative impact from higher than expected lapses on variable annuities, partially offset by the impact on DAC from actual versus expected market performance based on our view of bond and equity performance, which was a benefit of $8 million for the first quarter of 2017 compared to an expense of $5 million for the prior year period.ProtectionThe following table presents the results of operations of our Protection segment on an operating basis: Three Months Ended March 31, Change2017 2016(in millions)  Revenues       Management and financial advice fees$13 $13 $— — %Distribution fees25 23 2 9Net investment income85 80 5 6Premiums294 318 (24) (8)Other revenues104 108 (4) (4)Total revenues521 542 (21) (4)Banking and deposit interest expense— — — —Total net revenues521 542 (21) (4)Expenses      Distribution expenses17 16 1 6Interest credited to fixed accounts44 43 1 2Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses297 313 (16) (5)Amortization of deferred acquisition costs28 37 (9) (24)Interest and debt expense6 7 (1) (14)General and administrative expense66 58 8 14Total expenses458 474 (16) (3)Operating earnings$63 $68 $(5) (7)%64AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC.

In the first quarter of 2017, we entered into reinsurance arrangements designed to reduce risk, particularly in several wind/hail states where losses have been elevated.ExpensesTotal expenses, which exclude the market impact on indexed universal life benefits (net of hedges and the related DAC amortization) and the DAC offset to net realized investment gains or losses, decreased $16 million, or 3%, to $458 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to $474 million for the prior year period due to a decrease in benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses. Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses decreased $16 million, or 5%, to $297 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to $313 million for the prior year period due to a $30 million decrease in auto and home expenses reflecting a lower non-catastrophe loss ratio and the impact of new quota share reinsurance arrangements, partially offset by a $9 million increase in life and DI insurance claims. Catastrophe losses, which were higher than anticipated in both periods due to wind and hail storms, were $25 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to $23 million for the prior year period.

Our Corporate & Other segment pretax operating loss increased $31 million, or 63%, to $80 million for the 65AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to $49 million for the prior year period primarily due to a decrease in net investment income and an increase in general and administrative expense. Net investment income decreased $12 million, or 30%, to $28 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to $40 million for the prior year period primarily due to higher amortization relating to an increase in low income housing assets and the impact of interest allocation between subsidiaries.General and administrative expense increased $19 million, or 35%, to $74 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to $55 million for the prior year period primarily due to a $9 million expense related to the renegotiation of a vendor arrangement, a $5 million increase in expense related to planning and implementation of the new Department of Labor fiduciary standard and higher performance based compensation. Market RiskOur primary market risk exposures are interest rate, equity price, foreign currency exchange rate and credit risk. Equity price and interest rate fluctuations can have a significant impact on our results of operations, primarily due to the effects they have on the asset management and other asset-based fees we earn, the spread income generated on our fixed annuities, fixed insurance, brokerage client cash balances, face-amount certificate products and the fixed portion of our variable annuities and variable insurance contracts, the value of DAC and DSIC assets, the value of liabilities for guaranteed benefits associated with our variable annuities and the value of derivatives held to hedge these benefits.Our earnings from fixed annuities, fixed insurance, and the fixed portion of variable annuities and variable insurance contracts are based upon the spread between rates earned on assets held and the rates at which interest is credited to accounts. We primarily invest in fixed rate securities to fund the rate credited to clients. We guarantee an interest rate to the holders of these products. Investment assets and client liabilities generally differ as it relates to basis, repricing or maturity characteristics. Rates credited to clients’ accounts generally reset at shorter intervals than the yield on the underlying investments. Therefore, in an increasing interest rate environment, higher interest rates may be reflected in crediting rates to clients sooner than in rates earned on invested assets, which could result in a reduced spread between the two rates, reduced earned income and a negative impact on pretax income. However, the current low interest rate environment is resulting in interest rates below the level of some of our liability guaranteed minimum interest rates (“GMIRs”). Hence, a modest rise in interest rates would not necessarily result in changes to all the liability credited rates while projected asset purchases would capture the full increase in interest rates. This dynamic would result in widening spreads under a modestly rising rate scenario given the current relationship between the current level of interest rates and the underlying GMIRs on the business. As a result of the low interest rate environment, our current reinvestment yields are generally lower than the current portfolio yield. We expect our portfolio income yields to continue to decline in future periods if interest rates remain low. The carrying value and weighted average yield of non-structured fixed maturity securities and commercial mortgage loans that may generate proceeds to reinvest through March 31, 2019 due to prepayment, maturity or call activity at the option of the issuer, excluding securities with a make-whole provision, were $4.6 billion and 4.4%, respectively, as of March 31, 2017. In addition, residential mortgage-backed securities, which are subject to prepayment risk as a result of the low interest rate environment, totaled $6.9 billion and had a weighted average yield of 2.7% as of March 31, 2017. While these amounts represent investments that could be subject to reinvestment risk, it is also possible that these investments will be used to fund liabilities or may not be prepaid and will remain invested at their current yields. In addition to the interest rate environment, the mix of benefit payments versus product sales as well as the timing and volumes associated with such mix may impact our investment yield. Furthermore, reinvestment activities and the associated investment yield may also be impacted by corporate strategies implemented at management’s discretion. The average yield for investment purchases during the three months ended March 31, 2017 was approximately 2.9%.The reinvestment of proceeds from maturities, calls and prepayments at rates below the current portfolio yield, which may be below the level of some liability GMIRs, will have a negative impact to future operating results. To mitigate the unfavorable impact that the low interest rate environment has on our spread income, we assess reinvestment risk in our investment portfolio and monitor this risk in accordance with our asset/liability management framework. In addition, we may reduce the crediting rates on our fixed products when warranted, subject to guaranteed minimums.In addition to the fixed rate exposures noted above, RiverSource Life also has the following variable annuity guarantee benefits: guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits (“GMWB”), guaranteed minimum accumulation benefits (“GMAB”), guaranteed minimum death benefits (“GMDB”) and guaranteed minimum income benefits (“GMIB”). Each of these guaranteed benefits guarantees payouts to the annuity holder under certain specific conditions regardless of the performance of the underlying invested assets.The variable annuity guarantees continue to be managed by utilizing a hedging program which attempts to match the sensitivity of the assets with the sensitivity of the liabilities. This approach works with the premise that matched sensitivities will produce a highly effective hedging result. Our comprehensive hedging program focuses mainly on first order sensitivities of assets and liabilities: Equity Market Level (Delta), Interest Rate Level (Rho) and Volatility (Vega). Additionally, various second order sensitivities are managed. We use various index options across the term structure, interest rate swaps and swaptions, total return swaps and futures to manage the risk exposures. The exposures are measured and monitored daily, and adjustments to the hedge portfolio are made as necessary.66AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. We have a macro hedge program to provide protection against the statutory tail scenario risk arising from variable annuity reserves on our statutory surplus and to cover some of the residual risks not covered by other hedging activities. We assess the residual risk under a range of scenarios in creating and executing the macro hedge program. As a means of economically hedging these risks, we use a combination of futures, options, interest rate swaptions and/or swaps. Certain of the macro hedge derivatives used contain settlement provisions linked to both equity returns and interest rates; the remaining are interest rate contracts or equity contracts. The macro hedge program could result in additional earnings volatility as changes in the value of the macro hedge derivatives, which are designed to reduce statutory capital volatility, may not be closely aligned to changes in the variable annuity guarantee embedded derivatives.To evaluate interest rate and equity price risk we perform sensitivity testing which measures the impact on pretax income from the sources listed below for a 12-month period following a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates or a hypothetical 10% decline in equity prices. The interest rate risk test assumes a sudden 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve, with rates then staying at those levels for the next 12 months. The equity price risk test assumes a sudden 10% drop in equity prices, with equity prices then staying at those levels for the next 12 months. In estimating the values of variable annuity riders, equity indexed annuities, stock market certificates, indexed universal life insurance and the associated hedge assets, we assume no change in implied market volatility despite the 10% drop in equity prices.The following tables present our estimate of the impact on pretax income from the above defined hypothetical market movements as of March 31, 2017:Equity Price Decline 10% Equity Price Exposure to Pretax IncomeBefore Hedge Impact Hedge Impact Net Impact  (in millions)Asset-based management and distribution fees (1) $(243) $4 $(239)DAC and DSIC amortization (2) (3) (125) — (125)Variable annuity riders:      GMDB and GMIB (3) (31) — (31)GMWB (3) (4) (470) 315 (155)GMAB (33) 33 —DAC and DSIC amortization (4) N/A N/A (1)Total variable annuity riders (534) 348 (187)Macro hedge program (5) — 35 35Equity indexed annuities 1 (1) —Certificates 3 (3) —Indexed universal life insurance 58 (44) 14Total $(840) $339 $(502)67AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC.

This is a significantly more conservative estimate than if we assumed management follows its mean reversion guideline and increased near-term rates to recover the drop in equity values over a five-year period. We make this same conservative assumption in estimating the impact from GMDB and GMIB riders and the life contingent benefits associated with GMWB.(4) Market impact on DAC and DSIC amortization related to variable annuity riders is modeled net of hedge impact.(5) The market impact of the macro hedge program is modeled net of any related impact to DAC and DSIC amortization.The above results compare to an estimated negative net impact to pretax income of $490 million related to a 10% equity price decline and an estimated positive net impact to pretax income of $297 million related to a 100 basis point increase in interest rates as of December 31, 2016. The change in interest rate exposure from December 31, 2016 is primarily the result of changes in market conditions.Net impacts shown in the above table from GMWB and GMAB riders result largely from differences between the liability valuation basis and the hedging basis. Liabilities are valued using fair value accounting principles, with risk margins incorporated in contractholder behavior assumptions and with discount rates increased to reflect a current market estimate of our risk of nonperformance specific to these liabilities. The Company’s hedging is based on our determination of economic risk, which excludes certain items in the liability valuation including the nonperformance spread risk.Actual results could differ materially from those illustrated above as they are based on a number of estimates and assumptions. These include assuming that implied market volatility does not change when equity prices fall by 10%, that management does not increase assumed equity asset growth rates to anticipate recovery of the drop in equity values when valuing DAC, DSIC and GMDB and GMIB liability values and that the 100 basis point increase in interest rates is a parallel shift of the yield curve. Furthermore, we have not tried to anticipate changes in client preferences for different types of assets or other changes in client behavior, nor have we tried to anticipate actions management might take to increase revenues or reduce expenses in these scenarios.The selection of a 100 basis point interest rate increase as well as a 10% equity price decline should not be construed as a prediction of future market events. Impacts of larger or smaller changes in interest rates or equity prices may not be proportional to those shown for a 100 basis point increase in interest rates or a 10% decline in equity prices.Fair Value MeasurementsWe report certain assets and liabilities at fair value; specifically, separate account assets, derivatives, embedded derivatives, properties held by our consolidated property funds, and most investments and cash equivalents. Fair value assumes the exchange of assets or liabilities occurs in orderly transactions and is not the result of a forced liquidation or distressed sale. We include actual market prices, or observable inputs, in our fair value measurements to the extent available. Broker quotes are obtained when quotes from pricing services are not available. We validate prices obtained from third parties through a variety of means such as: price variance analysis, subsequent sales testing, stale price review, price comparison across pricing vendors and due diligence reviews of vendors. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our fair value measurements.68AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. Fair Value of Liabilities and Nonperformance RiskCompanies are required to measure the fair value of liabilities at the price that would be received to transfer the liability to a market participant (an exit price). Since there is not a market for our obligations of our variable annuity riders and indexed universal life insurance, we consider the assumptions participants in a hypothetical market would make to reflect an exit price. As a result, we adjust the valuation of variable annuity riders and indexed universal life insurance by updating certain contractholder assumptions, adding explicit margins to provide for profit, risk and expenses, and adjusting the rates used to discount expected cash flows to reflect a current market estimate of our nonperformance risk. The nonperformance risk adjustment is based on observable market data adjusted to estimate the risk of our life insurance company subsidiaries not fulfilling these liabilities. Consistent with general market conditions, this estimate resulted in a spread over the LIBOR swap curve as of March 31, 2017. As our estimate of this spread widens or tightens, the liability will decrease or increase. If this nonperformance credit spread moves to a zero spread over the LIBOR swap curve, the reduction to net income would be approximately $253 million, net of DAC, DSIC, unearned revenue amortization, the reinsurance accrual and income taxes (calculated at the statutory tax rate of 35%), based on March 31, 2017 credit spreads.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesOverviewWe maintained substantial liquidity during the three months ended March 31, 2017. At March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, we had $2.0 billion and $2.3 billion, respectively, in cash and cash equivalents excluding CIEs. We have additional liquidity available through an unsecured revolving credit facility for up to $500 million that expires in May 2020. Under the terms of the credit agreement, we can increase this facility to $750 million upon satisfaction of certain approval requirements. Available borrowings under this facility are reduced by any outstanding letters of credit. At March 31, 2017, we had no outstanding borrowings under this credit facility and had $1 million of outstanding letters of credit. Our credit facility contains various administrative, reporting, legal and financial covenants. We were in compliance with all such covenants at March 31, 2017. We enter into short-term borrowings, which may include repurchase agreements and Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) advances, to reduce reinvestment risk. Short-term borrowings allow us to receive cash to reinvest in longer-duration assets, while paying back the short-term debt with cash flows generated by the fixed income portfolio. The balance of repurchase agreements at both March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 was $50 million, which is collateralized with agency residential mortgage backed securities and commercial mortgage backed securities from our investment portfolio. Our subsidiary, RiverSource Life Insurance Company (“RiverSource Life”), is a member of the FHLB of Des Moines, which provides access to collateralized borrowings. As of both March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, we had $150 million of borrowings from the FHLB, which is collateralized with commercial mortgage backed securities. We believe cash flows from operating activities, available cash balances and our availability of revolver borrowings will be sufficient to fund our operating liquidity needs.Dividends from SubsidiariesAmeriprise Financial is primarily a parent holding company for the operations carried out by our wholly owned subsidiaries. Because of our holding company structure, our ability to meet our cash requirements, including the payment of dividends on our common stock, substantially depends upon the receipt of dividends or return of capital from our subsidiaries, particularly our life insurance subsidiary, RiverSource Life, our face-amount certificate subsidiary, Ameriprise Certificate Company (“ACC”), AMPF Holding Corporation, which is the parent company of our retail introducing broker-dealer subsidiary, Ameriprise Financial Services, Inc. (“AFSI”) and our clearing broker-dealer subsidiary, American Enterprise Investment Services, Inc. (“AEIS”), our Auto and Home insurance subsidiary, IDS Property Casualty Insurance Company (“IDS Property Casualty”), doing business as Ameriprise Auto & Home Insurance, our transfer agent subsidiary, Columbia Management Investment Services Corp., our investment advisory company, Columbia Management Investment Advisers, LLC, and Threadneedle Asset Management Holdings Sàrl. The payment of dividends by many of our subsidiaries is restricted and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to regulatory capital requirements.69AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. Actual capital and regulatory capital requirements for our wholly owned subsidiaries subject to regulatory capital requirements were as follows: Actual Capital Regulatory Capital RequirementsMarch 31, 2017 December 31, 2016March 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 (in millions)RiverSource Life(1)(2)$2,729 $3,052 N/A $606RiverSource Life of NY(1)(2)328 323 N/A 38IDS Property Casualty(1)(3)806 800 220 213Ameriprise Insurance Company(1)(3)48 47 2 2ACC(4)(5)349 335 329 317Threadneedle Asset Management Holdings Sàrl(6)505 360 152 149Ameriprise National Trust Bank(7)22 22 10 10AFSI(3)(4)109 77 # #Ameriprise Captive Insurance Company(3)52 51 14 9Ameriprise Trust Company(3)29 29 24 24AEIS(3)(4)182 107 20 19RiverSource Distributors, Inc.(3)(4)12 11 # #Columbia Management Investment Distributors, Inc.(3)(4)17 14 # #N/A Not applicable.# Amounts are less than $1 million.(1) Actual capital is determined on a statutory basis.(2) Regulatory capital requirement is based on the statutory risk-based capital filing.(3) Regulatory capital requirement is based on the applicable regulatory requirement, calculated as of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016.(4) Actual capital is determined on an adjusted GAAP basis.(5) ACC is required to hold capital in compliance with the Minnesota Department of Commerce and SEC capital requirements.(6) Actual capital and regulatory capital requirements are determined in accordance with U.K. regulatory legislation. The regulatory capital requirements at March 31, 2017 represent calculations at December 31, 2016 of the rule based requirements, as specified by FCA regulations.(7) Ameriprise National Trust Bank is required to maintain capital in compliance with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency regulations and policies.In addition to the particular regulations restricting dividend payments and establishing subsidiary capitalization requirements, we take into account the overall health of the business, capital levels and risk management considerations in determining a dividend strategy for payments to our parent holding company from our subsidiaries, and in deciding to use cash to make capital contributions to our subsidiaries.During the three months ended March 31, 2017, the parent holding company received cash dividends or a return of capital from its subsidiaries of $458 million (including $300 million from RiverSource Life) and contributed cash to its subsidiaries of $25 million. During the three months ended March 31, 2016, the parent holding company received cash dividends or a return of capital from its subsidiaries of $546 million (including $400 million from RiverSource Life) and contributed cash to its subsidiaries of $93 million (including $75 million to IDS Property Casualty).In 2009, RiverSource established an agreement to protect its exposure to Genworth Life Insurance Company (“GLIC”) for its reinsured LTC. In 2016, substantial enhancements to this reinsurance protection agreement were finalized. The terms of these confidential provisions within the agreement have been shared, in the normal course of regular reviews, with our domiciliary regulator and rating agencies. Management believes that this agreement and offsetting non LTC legacy arrangements with Genworth will enable RiverSource to recover on all net exposure in the event of an insolvency of GLIC.Dividends Paid to Shareholders and Share Repurchases We paid regular quarterly dividends to our shareholders totaling $121 million and $117 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. On April 24, 2017, we announced a quarterly dividend of $0.83 per common share. The dividend will be paid on May 19, 2017 to our shareholders of record at the close of business on May 8, 2017.In December 2015, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase up to $2.5 billion of our common stock through December 31, 2017. As of March 31, 2017, we had $572 million remaining under this share repurchase authorization. In April 2017, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase up to an additional $2.5 billion of our common stock through June 30, 2019. We intend to fund share repurchases through existing working capital, future earnings and other customary financing methods. The share repurchase 70AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. programs do not require the purchase of any minimum number of shares, and depending on market conditions and other factors, these purchases may be commenced or suspended at any time without prior notice. Acquisitions under the share repurchase programs may be made in the open market, through privately negotiated transactions or block trades or other means. During the three months ended March 31, 2017, we repurchased a total of 2.9 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $124.01 per share.Cash Flows Cash flows of CIEs and restricted and segregated cash are reflected in our cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities, investing activities and financing activities. Cash held by CIEs is not available for general use by Ameriprise Financial, nor is Ameriprise Financial cash available for general use by its CIEs. Cash segregated under federal and other regulations is held for the exclusive benefit of our brokerage customers and is not available for general use by Ameriprise Financial.Operating ActivitiesNet cash provided by operating activities decreased $610 million to $6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to $616 million for the prior year period primarily due to a $114 million increase in income taxes paid and net cash outflows related to derivatives for the first quarter of 2017 compared to net cash inflows for the prior year period.Investing ActivitiesOur investing activities primarily relate to our Available-for-Sale investment portfolio. Further, this activity is significantly affected by the net flows of our investment certificate, fixed annuity and universal life products reflected in financing activities.Net cash provided by investing activities increased $210 million to $211 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to $1 million for the prior year period primarily due to a $231 million decrease in cash used for purchases of Available-for-Sale securities and a $318 million increase in proceeds from maturities, sinking fund payments and calls of Available-for-Sale securities, partially offset by proceeds of $260 million from the sale of a portion of our consumer loans in the first quarter of 2016.Financing ActivitiesNet cash used in financing activities increased $112 million to $434 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to $322 million for the prior year period primarily due to a $276 million increase in maturities, withdrawals and cash surrenders of investment certificates, partially offset by $125 million increase in proceeds from additions of investment certificates. Contractual CommitmentsThere have been no material changes to our contractual obligations disclosed in our 2016 10-K. Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe provide asset management services to investment entities which are considered to be VIEs, such as CLOs, hedge funds, property funds and private equity funds, which are sponsored by us. We consolidate certain CLOs. We have determined that consolidation is not required for hedge funds, property funds and private equity funds, which are sponsored by us. Our maximum exposure to loss with respect to our investment in these non-consolidated entities is limited to our carrying value. We have no obligation to provide further financial or other support to these investment entities nor have we provided any support to these investment entities.
