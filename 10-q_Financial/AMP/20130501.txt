Item 1A Risk Factors” in our 2012 10-K and other factors as discussed herein.   Equity price, credit market and interest rate fluctuations can have a significant impact on our results of operations, primarily due to the effects they have on the asset management and other asset-based fees we earn, the “spread” income generated on our annuities, deposit products and universal life (“UL”) insurance products, the value of deferred acquisition costs (“DAC”) and deferred sales inducement costs (“DSIC”) assets, the values of liabilities for guaranteed benefits associated with our variable annuities and the values of derivatives held to hedge these benefits.   Earnings, as well as operating earnings, will continue to be negatively impacted by the ongoing low interest rate environment. In addition to continuing spread compression in our interest sensitive product lines, there is also the potential for interest rate related impacts to DAC and DSIC amortization and the level of reserves as a result of our ongoing review of various actuarial related assumptions, which could be material.   In January 2013, we completed the conversion of our federal savings bank subsidiary, Ameriprise Bank, FSB, to a limited powers national trust bank , which conversion included changing the name of this subsidiary to Ameriprise National Trust Bank (references herein to “Ameriprise Bank” pertain to this same subsidiary whether before or after its conversion). In connection with this conversion, deposit-taking and credit-originating activities of Ameriprise Bank were terminated. In addition, Ameriprise Financial was deregistered by the Federal Reserve as a savings and loan holding company and will no longer be subject to supervision and regulation as such. We will continue to make available to our clients certain deposit and credit products via referral arrangements with respected third party financial institutions. The transition released approximately $375 million of formerly required capital, which we anticipate using to repurchase shares throughout 2013. We estimate that the transition will reduce our annual earnings by approximately $60 million in 2013. At the enterprise level, we anticipate that the earnings per share impact will be neutralized by the end of 2013, as we redeploy the excess capital to shareholders through share repurchases.   We consolidate certain collateralized debt obligations (“CDOs”) and other investment products (collectively, “investment entities”) for which we provide asset management services to and sponsor for the investment of client assets in the normal course of business. These entities are defined as consolidated investment entities (“CIEs”). For further information on CIEs, see Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Changes in the valuation of the CIE assets and liabilities impact pretax income. The net income (loss) of the CIEs is reflected in net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests. The results of operations of the CIEs are reflected in the Corporate & Other segment. On a consolidated basis, the management fees we earn for the services we provide to the CIEs and the related general and administrative expenses are eliminated and the changes in the assets and liabilities related to the CIEs, primarily debt and underlying syndicated loans, are reflected in net investment income. We continue to include the fees in the management and financial advice fees line within our Asset Management segment.   45      Table of Contents   While our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), management believes that operating measures, which exclude net realized gains or losses; the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits, net of hedges and the related DSIC and DAC amortization; the market impact on index universal life benefits, net of hedges and the related DAC amortization, unearned revenue amortization, and the reinsurance accrual; integration and restructuring charges; income (loss) from discontinued operations; and the impact of consolidating CIEs, best reflect the underlying performance of our core operations and facilitate a more meaningful trend analysis. While the consolidation of the CIEs impacts our balance sheet and income statement, our exposure to these entities is unchanged and there is no impact to the underlying business results. Management uses certain of these non-GAAP measures to evaluate our financial performance on a basis comparable to that used by some securities analysts and investors. Also, certain of these non-GAAP measures are taken into consideration, to varying degrees, for purposes of business planning and analysis and for certain compensation-related matters. Throughout our Management’s Discussion and Analysis, these non-GAAP measures are referred to as operating measures.   It is management’s priority to increase shareholder value over a multi-year horizon by achieving our on-average, over-time financial targets.   Our financial targets are:   · Operating total net revenue growth of 6% to 8%,   · Operating earnings per diluted share growth of 12% to 15%, and   · Operating return on equity excluding accumulated other comprehensive income of 15% to 18%.   The following tables reconcile our GAAP measures to operating measures:              Three Months Ended March 31,                 2013       2012                 (in millions)         Total net revenues       $   2,691       $   2,561         Less: Revenue attributable to the CIEs       82       52         Less: Net realized gains (losses)       1       (2   )     Operating total net revenues       $   2,608       $   2,511                                     Per Diluted Share                 Three Months Ended March 31,       Three Months Ended March 31,                 2013       2012       2013       2012                 (in millions, except per share amounts)         Net income       $   365       $   248                         Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests       30       4                         Net income attributable to Ameriprise Financial       335       244       $   1.58       $   1.05         Less: Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax       (1   )   (1   )   —       (0.01   )     Net income from continuing operations attributable to Ameriprise Financial       336       245       1.58       1.06         Add: Integration/restructuring charges, net of tax (1)       1       15       —       0.06         Add: Market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits, net of tax (1)       2       74       0.01       0.32         Less: Net realized gains (losses), net of tax (1)       1       (1   )   —       (0.01   )     Operating earnings       $   338       $   335       $   1.59       $   1.45                                                   Weighted average common shares outstanding:                                         Basic       208.4       227.3                         Diluted       212.3       231.7                           (1) Calculated using the statutory tax rate of 35%.   46      Table of Contents   The following table reconciles the trailing twelve months’ sum of net income attributable to Ameriprise Financial to operating earnings and the five-point average of quarter-end equity to operating equity:              Twelve Months Ended March 31,                 2013       2012                 (in millions)         Net income attributable to Ameriprise Financial       $   1,120       $   1,119         Less: Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax       (2   )   10         Net income from continuing operations attributable to Ameriprise Financial       1,122       1,109         Less: Adjustments (1)       (126   )   (156   )     Operating earnings       $   1,248       $   1,265                                   Total Ameriprise Financial, Inc. shareholders’ equity       $   9,066       $   9,114         Less: Assets and liabilities held for sale       —       11         Less: Accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax       1,068       741         Total Ameriprise Financial, Inc. shareholders’ equity from continuing operations, excluding AOCI       7,998       8,362         Less: Equity impacts attributable to CIEs       384       454         Operating equity       $   7,614       $   7,908                                   Return on equity from continuing operations, excluding AOCI       14.0   %   13.3   %     Operating return on equity, excluding AOCI (2)       16.4   %   16.0   %       (1) Adjustments reflect the trailing twelve months’ sum of after-tax net realized gains/losses; the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits, net of hedges and related DSIC and DAC amortization; the market impact on index universal life benefits, net of hedges and the related DAC amortization, unearned revenue amortization, and the reinsurance accrual; and integration and restructuring charges. After-tax is calculated using the statutory tax rate of 35%.   (2) Operating return on equity, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”), is calculated using the trailing twelve months of earnings excluding the after-tax net realized gains/losses; market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits, net of hedges and related DSIC and DAC amortization; the market impact on index universal benefits, net of hedges and the related DAC amortization, unearned revenue amortization, and the reinsurance accrual; integration/restructuring charges; and discontinued operations in the numerator, and Ameriprise Financial shareholders’ equity, excluding AOCI; the impact of consolidating investment entities; and the assets and liabilities held for sale using a five-point average of quarter-end equity in the denominator.   Critical Accounting Policies   The accounting and reporting policies that we use affect our Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of our accounting and reporting policies are critical to an understanding of our consolidated results of operations and financial condition and, in some cases, the application of these policies can be significantly affected by the estimates, judgments and assumptions made by management during the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements. These accounting policies are discussed in detail in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis — Critical Accounting Policies” in our 2012 10-K.   Recent Accounting Pronouncements   For information regarding recent accounting pronouncements and their expected impact on our future consolidated results of operations and financial condition, see Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.   Assets Under Management and Administration   Assets under management (“AUM”) include external client assets for which we provide investment management services, such as the assets of the Columbia funds and Threadneedle funds, assets of institutional clients and assets of clients in our advisor platform held in wrap accounts as well as assets managed by sub-advisers selected by us. AUM also includes certain assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets for which we provide investment management services and recognize management fees in our Asset Management segment, such as the assets of the general account and the variable product funds held in the separate accounts of our life insurance subsidiaries and client assets of CIEs. These assets do not include assets under advisement, for which we provide model portfolios but do not have full discretionary investment authority. Corporate & Other AUM primarily includes former bank assets that are managed within our Corporate & Other segment.   47      Table of Contents   Assets under administration (“AUA”) include assets for which we provide administrative services such as client assets invested in other companies’ products that we offer outside of our wrap accounts. These assets include those held in clients’ brokerage accounts. We generally record revenues received from administered assets as distribution fees. We do not exercise management discretion over these assets and do not earn a management fee. These assets are not reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. AUA also includes certain assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets for which we do not provide investment management services and do not recognize management fees, such as investments in non-affiliated funds held in the separate accounts of our life insurance subsidiaries. These assets do not include assets under advisement, for which we provide model portfolios but do not have full discretionary investment authority.   The following table presents detail regarding our AUM and AUA:              March 31,                                 2013       2012       Change                 (in billions)         Assets Under Management and Administration                                         Advice & Wealth Management AUM       $   134.2       $   114.4       $   19.8       17   %     Asset Management AUM       466.5       463.0       3.5       1         Corporate & Other AUM       1.0       —       1.0       NM         Eliminations       (19.1   )   (13.9   )   (5.2   )   (37   )     Total Assets Under Management       582.6       563.5       19.1       3         Total Assets Under Administration       125.1       111.4       13.7       12         Total AUM and AUA       $   707.7       $   674.9       32.8       5   %                     Total AUM increased $19.1 billion, or 3%, to $582.6 billion as of March 31, 2013 compared to the prior year period due to a $19.8 billion increase in Advice & Wealth Management AUM driven by wrap account net inflows and market appreciation. See our segment results of operations discussion below for additional information on changes in our AUM.   Consolidated Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended March 31, 2013 and 2012   The following table presents our consolidated results of operations:              Three Months Ended March 31,                                 2013       2012       Change                 (in millions)         Revenues                                         Management and financial advice fees       $   1,244       $   1,132       $   112       10   %     Distribution fees       434       402       32       8         Net investment income       489       531       (42   )   (8   )     Premiums       310       301       9       3         Other revenues       222       206       16       8         Total revenues       2,699       2,572       127       5         Banking and deposit interest expense       8       11       (3   )   (27   )     Total net revenues       2,691       2,561       130       5         Expenses                                         Distribution expenses       726       666       60       9         Interest credited to fixed accounts       198       206       (8   )   (4   )     Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses       409       505       (96   )   (19   )     Amortization of deferred acquisition costs       75       31       44       NM         Interest and debt expense       66       69       (3   )   (4   )     General and administrative expense       730       762       (32   )   (4   )     Total expenses       2,204       2,239       (35   )   (2   )     Income from continuing operations before income tax provision        487       322       165       51         Income tax provision        121       73       48       66         Income from continuing operations       366       249       117       47         Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax       (1   )   (1   )   —       —         Net income       365       248       117       47         Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests       30       4       26       NM         Net income attributable to Ameriprise Financial       $   335       $   244       $   91       37   %      NM Not Meaningful.   48      Table of Contents   Overall   Income from continuing operations before income tax provision increased $165 million, or 51%, compared to the prior year period primarily reflecting the impact of market appreciation, wrap account net inflows and the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits (net of hedges and the related DSIC and DAC amortization), partially offset by the negative impact of the continued low interest rate environment and asset management net outflows. The market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits (net of hedges and the related DSIC and DAC amortization) was an expense of $2 million for the first quarter of 2013 compared to an expense of $113 million for the prior year period. The negative impact of the continued low interest rate environment was approximately $23 million pretax for the three months ended March 31, 2013 compared to the prior year period.   Net Revenues   Net revenues increased $130 million, or 5%, compared to the prior year period primarily due to higher management and financial advice fees and distribution fees, partially offset by lower net investment income.   Management and financial advice fees increased $112 million, or 10%, compared to the prior year period primarily due to higher asset-based fees driven by an increase in average AUM, as well as revenue enhancements related to various pricing adjustments. Average AUM increased $26.9 billion, or 5%, compared to the prior year period primarily due to market appreciation and wrap account net inflows, partially offset by asset management net outflows. See our discussion on the changes in AUM in our segment results of operations section below.   Distribution fees increased $32 million, or 8%, compared to the prior year period due to higher client assets and increased client activity.   Net investment income decreased $42 million, or 8%, compared to the prior year period reflecting a $56 million decrease in investment income on fixed maturity securities, partially offset by a $16 million increase in net investment income of CIEs. The decrease in investment income on fixed maturity securities was primarily due to continued low interest rates and approximately $30 million of lower net investment income due to the sale of Ameriprise Bank’s investment portfolio as a result of the transition of banking operations in the fourth quarter of 2012.   Other revenues increased $16 million, or 8%, compared to the prior year period due to higher fees from variable annuity guarantees driven by higher volumes, as well as higher fee rates.   Expenses   Total expenses decreased $35 million, or 2%, compared to the prior year period primarily due to a decrease in benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses and general and administrative expense, partially offset by an increase in distribution expenses and amortization of DAC.   Distribution expenses increased $60 million, or 9%, compared to the prior year period driven by growth in assets under management. See our discussion on the changes in AUM in our segment results of operations section below.   Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses decreased $96 million, or 19%, compared to the prior year period primarily due to the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits (net of hedges and the related DSIC amortization), which was an expense of $1 million in the first quarter of 2013 compared to an expense of $149 million in the first quarter of 2012, partially offset by higher reserve funding related to higher fees from variable annuity guarantees, an increase in reserves related to our auto and home business and a $23 million benefit from variable annuity model changes in the prior year period.   Amortization of DAC increased $44 million to $75 million for the three months ended March 31, 2013 compared to the prior year period primarily due to the DAC offset to the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits (net of hedges and the related DSIC amortization). The DAC offset to the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits (net of hedges and the related DSIC amortization) was an expense of $1 million in the first quarter of 2013 compared to a benefit of $36 million in the first quarter of 2012. The market impact on DAC was a benefit of $12 million in the first quarter of 2013 compared to a benefit of $20 million in the prior year period as a result of favorable equity market returns in the first quarter of 2013 compared to favorable equity and bond fund returns in the first quarter of 2012.   General and administrative expense decreased $32 million, or 4%, compared to the prior year period primarily due to a $21 million decrease in integration and restructuring charges, $8 million in lower expenses associated with the completion of the brokerage platform conversion, $14 million of lower bank-related expenses and lower expenses from re-engineering efforts, partially offset by a $9 million increase in expenses of CIEs and higher expenses from investments in the business.   49      Table of Contents   Income Taxes   Our effective tax rate on income from continuing operations including income attributable to noncontrolling interests was 25.0% for the three months ended March 31, 2013, compared to 22.6% for the prior year period. The effective tax rates are lower than the statutory rate as a result of tax preferred items including the dividends received deduction, foreign tax credits and low income housing credits in comparison to the levels of pretax income. The increase in the effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2013 compared to the prior year period is primarily the result of higher pretax income. Our effective tax rate on income from continuing operations excluding income attributable to noncontrolling interests was 26.6% for the three months ended March 31, 2013, compared to 22.9% for the prior year period.   It is possible there will be corporate tax reform in the next few years. While impossible to predict, corporate tax reform is likely to include a reduction in the corporate tax rate coupled with reductions in tax preferred items. Potential tax reform may also affect the U.S. tax rules regarding international operations. Any changes could have a material impact on our income tax expense and deferred tax balances.   Results of Operations by Segment for the Three Months Ended March 31, 2013 and 2012   Operating earnings is the measure of segment profit or loss management uses to evaluate segment performance. Operating earnings should not be viewed as a substitute for GAAP income from continuing operations before income tax provision. We believe the presentation of segment operating earnings as we measure it for management purposes enhances the understanding of our business by reflecting the underlying performance of our core operations and facilitating a more meaningful trend analysis. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the presentation of segment results and our definition of operating earnings.   The following table presents summary financial information by segment:              Three Months Ended March 31,                 2013       2012                 (in millions)         Advice & Wealth Management                         Net revenues       $   1,018       $   954         Expenses       887       860         Operating earnings       $   131       $   94         Asset Management                         Net revenues       $   746       $   711         Expenses       602       580         Operating earnings       $   144       $   131         Annuities                         Net revenues       $   630       $   628         Expenses       474       439         Operating earnings       $   156       $   189         Protection                         Net revenues       $   538       $   522         Expenses       428       415         Operating earnings       $   110       $   107         Corporate & Other                         Net revenues       $   (3   )   $   8         Expenses       78       73         Operating loss       $   (81   )   $   (65   )      50      Table of Contents   Advice & Wealth Management   Our Advice & Wealth Management segment provides financial planning and advice, as well as full-service brokerage services, primarily to retail clients through our advisors. Our advisors have access to a diversified selection of both affiliated and non-affiliated products to help clients meet their financial needs. A significant portion of revenues in this segment is fee-based, driven by the level of client assets, which is impacted by both market movements and net asset flows. We also earn net investment income on invested assets primarily from certificate products. This segment earns revenues (distribution fees) for distributing non-affiliated products and earns intersegment revenues (distribution fees) for distributing our affiliated products and services to our retail clients. Intersegment expenses for this segment include expenses for investment management services provided by the Asset Management segment.   In addition to purchases of affiliated and non-affiliated mutual funds and other securities on a stand-alone basis, clients may purchase mutual funds, among other securities, in connection with investment advisory fee-based “wrap account” programs or services, and pay fees based on a percentage of their assets.   In January 2013, we completed the conversion of our federal savings bank subsidiary, Ameriprise Bank to a limited powers national trust bank. In 2012, all checking, savings and money market accounts and certificates of deposit were liquidated and returned to our clients, Ameriprise Bank’s consumer loan portfolio, including first mortgages, home equity loans, home equity lines of credit and unsecured loans, was sold to affiliates of Ameriprise Bank, and Ameriprise Bank’s credit card account portfolio was sold to Barclays Bank Delaware (“Barclays”). See additional discussion on the transition and the impact to our business in the Overview section above.   The following table presents the changes in wrap account assets for the three months ended March 31:              2013       2012                 (in billions)         Beginning balance       $   124.6        $   103.4          Net flows       4.1        2.9          Market appreciation and other       5.1        6.8          Ending balance       $   133.8        $   113.1                                    Average balance (1)       $   129.2        $   108.3            (1) Average ending balances are calculated using a simple average of two quarters of data.   Wrap account assets increased $9.2 billion, or 7%, during the three months ended March 31, 2013 due to net inflows of $4.1 billion and market appreciation and other of $5.1 billion. Wrap account net inflows increased $1.2 billion, or 41%, compared to the prior year period reflecting improved markets and investor confidence. Average wrap account assets increased $20.9 billion, or 19%, compared to the prior year period due to net inflows and market appreciation.

Pretax operating earnings for the three months ended March 31, 2012 included $15 million of Ameriprise Bank earnings. The negative impact of continued low interest rates was $10 million compared to the prior year period. The impact of low interest rates will be approximately $10 million per quarter for the balance of the year. Pretax operating margin was 12.9% for the three months ended March 31, 2013 compared to 9.9% for the prior year period.   Net Revenues   Net revenues exclude net realized gains or losses. Net revenues increased $64 million, or 7%, to $1.0 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2013 compared to $954 million for the prior year period reflecting retail client net inflows, market appreciation and increased client activity, partially offset by lower net investment income primarily due to the transition of banking operations in the fourth quarter of 2012. Net revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2012 included $32 million of Ameriprise Bank net revenues. Operating net revenue per branded advisor was $104,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2013, up 6% from the prior year period. Total branded advisors were 9,777 at March 31, 2013 compared to 9,744 at March 31, 2012.   Management and financial advice fees increased $64 million, or 16%, to $476 million for the three months ended March 31, 2013 compared to $412 million for the prior year period driven by growth in wrap account assets. Average wrap account assets increased $20.9 billion, or 19%, to $129.2 billion at March 31, 2013 compared to the prior year period due to net inflows and market appreciation. See our discussion of the changes in wrap account assets above.   Distribution fees increased $32 million, or 7%, to $503 million for the three months ended March 31, 2013 compared to $471 million for the prior year period primarily due to higher client assets and increased client activity.   Net investment income decreased $32 million, or 50%, to $32 million for the three months ended March 31, 2013 compared to $64 million for the prior year period due to the transition of banking operations in the fourth quarter of 2012, as well as a lower asset earnings rate on invested assets. Net investment income of Ameriprise Bank was $30 million for the three months ended March 31, 2012.   Expenses   Total expenses increased $27 million, or 3%, to $887 million for the three months ended March 31, 2013 compared to $860 million for the prior year period due to a $53 million increase in distribution expenses driven by higher compensation due to strong growth in client assets, partially offset by a $26 million decrease in general and administrative expense primarily due to the transition of banking operations in the fourth quarter of 2012 and $8 million of lower expenses associated with the completion of the brokerage platform conversion. General and administrative expense of Ameriprise Bank was $17 million for the three months ended March 31, 2012.   52      Table of Contents   Asset Management   Our Asset Management segment provides investment advice and investment products to retail, high net worth and institutional clients. Such products and services are provided on a global scale through Columbia Management and Threadneedle. Columbia Management primarily provides U.S. domestic products and services and Threadneedle primarily provides international investment products and services. We provide clients with U.S. domestic individual products through unaffiliated third party financial institutions and through our Advice & Wealth Management segment, and we provide institutional products and services through our institutional sales force. International retail products are primarily distributed through third-party financial institutions and unaffiliated financial advisors. Individual products include mutual funds, exchange-traded funds and variable product funds underlying insurance and annuity separate accounts. Institutional asset management services are designed to meet specific client objectives and may involve a range of products, including those that focus on traditional asset classes, separately managed accounts, individually managed accounts, collateralized loan obligations, hedge funds, collective funds and property funds. Collateralized loan obligations and hedge funds are classified as alternative assets. Revenues in this segment are primarily earned as fees based on managed asset balances, which are impacted by market movements, net asset flows, asset allocation and product mix. We may also earn performance fees from certain accounts where investment performance meets or exceeds certain pre-identified targets. In addition to the products and services provided to third-party clients, management teams serving our Asset Management segment provide all intercompany asset management services for Ameriprise Financial subsidiaries. The fees for such services are reflected within the Asset Management segment results through intersegment transfer pricing. Intersegment expenses for this segment include distribution expenses for services provided by our Advice & Wealth Management, Annuities and Protection segments.   On April 30, 2010, we completed the acquisition of the long-term asset management business of the Columbia Management Group from Bank of America. The acquisition significantly enhanced the capabilities of the Asset Management segment by increasing its scale, broadening its retail and institutional distribution capabilities and strengthening and diversifying its lineup of retail and institutional products. The integration of the Columbia Management business, which was completed in the second quarter of 2012, involved organizational changes to our portfolio management and analytical teams and to our operational, compliance, sales and marketing support staffs. This integration also involved the streamlining of our U.S. domestic product offerings. As a result of the integration, we combined RiverSource Investments, our legacy U.S. asset management business, with Columbia Management, under the Columbia brand. Total U.S. retail assets and number of funds under the Columbia brand as of March 31, 2013 were $227.5 billion and 212 funds, respectively.   From time to time, fee waivers have been provided to the Columbia Money Market Funds (the “Funds”) by Columbia Management and certain other subsidiaries performing services for the Funds for the purposes of reducing the expenses charged to a Fund in a given period to maintain or improve a Fund’s net yield in that period. Our subsidiaries may enter into contractual arrangements with the Funds identifying the specific fees to be waived and/or expenses to be reimbursed, as well as the time period for which such waivers will apply. In aggregate, we voluntarily waived fees of $3 million for both the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2012.   Threadneedle remains our primary international investment management platform. Threadneedle manages seven OEICs and two Societe d’Investissement A Capital Variable (“SICAV”) offering. The seven OEICs are Threadneedle Investment Funds ICVC (“TIF”), Threadneedle Specialist Investment Funds ICVC (“TSIF”), Threadneedle Focus Investment Funds (“TFIF”), Threadneedle Portfolio Advantage Funds (“TPAF”), Threadneedle Investment Funds ICVC II (“TIF II”), Threadneedle Investment Funds ICVC III (“TIF III”) and Threadneedle Investment Funds ICVC IV (“TIF IV”). TIF, TSIF, TFIF, TPAF, TIF II, TIF III and TIF IV are structured as umbrella companies with a total of 70 (33, 14, 1, 2, 6, 8 and 6, respectively) sub funds covering the world’s bond and equity markets. The SICAVs are the Threadneedle (Lux) SICAV (“T(Lux)”) and the Columbia Threadneedle SICAV-SIF (“SIF”). T(Lux) and SIF are structured as umbrella companies with a total of 32 (30 and 2, respectively) sub funds covering the world’s bond, commodities and equity markets. In addition, Threadneedle manages 13 unit trusts, 10 of which invest into the OEICs, ten property unit trusts and one property fund of funds.   53      Table of Contents   The following tables present the mutual fund performance of our retail Columbia and Threadneedle funds as of March 31, 2013 and 2012:   Columbia Mutual Fund Rankings in top 2 Lipper Quartiles                              2013       2012                                                   Domestic Equity       Equal weighted       1 year       52   %   46   %                     3 year       51   %   60   %                     5 year       51   %   63   %             Asset weighted       1 year       56   %   59   %                     3 year       69   %   76   %                     5 year       71   %   60   %                                               International Equity       Equal weighted       1 year       39   %   83   %                     3 year       56   %   65   %                     5 year       57   %   64   %             Asset weighted       1 year       20   %   93   %                     3 year       25   %   75   %                     5 year       81   %   84   %                                               Taxable Fixed Income       Equal weighted       1 year       63   %   85   %                     3 year       78   %   45   %                     5 year       82   %   68   %             Asset weighted       1 year       70   %   95   %                     3 year       83   %   44   %                     5 year       98   %   75   %                                               Tax Exempt Fixed Income       Equal weighted       1 year       95   %   90   %                     3 year       100   %   95   %                     5 year       100   %   90   %             Asset weighted       1 year       93   %   82   %                     3 year       100   %   85   %                     5 year       100   %   98   %                                               Asset Allocation Funds       Equal weighted       1 year       54   %   91   %                     3 year       64   %   67   %                     5 year       82   %   52   %             Asset weighted       1 year       62   %   92   %                     3 year       84   %   89   %                     5 year       94   %   88   %                                               Number of funds with 4 or 5 Morningstar star ratings       Overall       52       56                         3 year       50       53                         5 year       44       49                                                   Percent of funds with 4 or 5 Morningstar star ratings       Overall       51   %   47   %                     3 year       49   %   44   %                     5 year       45   %   44   %                                               Percent of assets with 4 or 5 Morningstar star ratings       Overall       58   %   66   %                     3 year       49   %   53   %                     5 year       47   %   44   %      Mutual fund performance rankings are based on the performance of Class Z fund shares for Columbia branded mutual funds. In instances where a fund’s Class Z shares do not have a full one, three or five year track record, performance for an older share class of the same fund, typically Class A shares, is utilized for the period before Class Z shares were launched. No adjustments to the historical track records are made to account for differences in fund expenses between share classes of a fund.   Equal Weighted Rankings in Top 2 Quartiles: Counts the number of funds with above median ranking divided by the total number of funds. Asset size is not a factor.   Asset Weighted Rankings in Top 2 Quartiles: Sums the total assets of the funds with above median ranking (using Class Z and appended Class Z) divided by total assets of all funds. Funds with more assets will receive a greater share of the total percentage above or below median.   Aggregated data includes all Columbia branded mutual funds.   54      Table of Contents   Threadneedle Retail Fund Rankings in Top 2 Morningstar Quartiles or Above Index Benchmark                              2013       2012         Equity       Equal weighted       1 year       71   %   73   %                     3 year       78   %   73   %                     5 year       84   %   86   %             Asset weighted       1 year       60   %   84   %                     3 year       92   %   78   %                     5 year       94   %   87   %                                               Fixed Income       Equal weighted       1 year       67   %   79   %                     3 year       57   %   85   %                     5 year       92   %   82   %             Asset weighted       1 year       29   %   80   %                     3 year       37   %   80   %                     5 year       98   %   97   %                                               Allocation (Managed) Funds       Equal weighted       1 year       83   %   67   %                     3 year       67   %   50   %                     5 year       83   %   100   %             Asset weighted       1 year       86   %   80   %                     3 year       78   %   41   %                     5 year       86   %   100   %      The performance of each fund is measured on a consistent basis against the most appropriate benchmark — a peer group of similar funds or an index.

Total segment AUM increased $11.1 billion, or 2%, during the three months ended March 31, 2013 primarily due to market appreciation, partially offset by net outflows of $5.7 billion and the negative impact of foreign currency translation. Management expects, consistent with prior patterns of outflows, that outflows of primarily low margin assets directly or indirectly affiliated with Threadneedle and Columbia former parent companies will continue for the foreseeable future. The overall impact to segment results is difficult to quantify due to uncertain timing, volume and mix of the outflows.   Columbia managed assets increased $10.9 billion, or 3%, during the three months ended March 31, 2013 due to market appreciation, partially offset by net outflows. Columbia retail funds increased $11.2 billion, or 5%, during the three months ended March 31, 2013 due to market appreciation, partially offset by net outflows. Columbia retail net outflows of $1.8 billion in the first quarter of 2013 included outflows from a large distribution partner that continued to re-balance asset concentrations and continued outflows from a third party sub-advisor. Columbia retail net outflows for the first quarter of 2013 also included approximately $0.6 billion of outflows in the Registered Investment Advisor (“RIA”) channel, where we had taken actions to improve the profitability of flows by changing the share class that we are offering. We expect to see more outflows in the RIA channel over the next few quarters resulting from this share class change. Columbia institutional AUM decreased $0.5 billion, or 1%, due to net outflows, partially offset by market appreciation. Columbia institutional net outflows of $3.2 billion in the first quarter of 2013 included approximately $1.0 billion of outflows from low basis point assets. In addition, several clients redeemed assets in both investment grade and high yield credit mandates given strong performance in these asset classes.   Threadneedle managed assets decreased $0.1 billion during the three months ended March 31, 2013 as market appreciation was offset by the negative impact of foreign currency translation and net outflows. Threadneedle retail funds increased $2.3 billion, or 6%, due to market appreciation and net inflows of $1.4 billion, partially offset by the negative impact of foreign   57      Table of Contents   currency translation. Threadneedle retail fund net inflows in the first quarter of 2013 were driven by strong consumer confidence and good sales in a few key products, particularly in Europe. Threadneedle institutional AUM decreased $2.3 billion, or 3%, due to net outflows and the negative impact of foreign currency translation, partially offset by market appreciation. Threadneedle institutional net outflows of $2.3 billion in the first quarter of 2013 primarily reflected $2.2 billion of outflows largely from legacy insurance assets, including $1.0 billion from a Japanese mandate.   The following table presents the results of operations of our Asset Management segment on an operating basis:              Three Months Ended March 31,                                 2013       2012       Change                 (in millions)     Revenues                                         Management and financial advice fees       $   627       $   586       $   41       7   %     Distribution fees       114       111       3       3         Net investment income       4       5       (1   )   (20   )     Other revenues       1       9       (8   )   (89   )     Total revenues       746       711       35       5         Banking and deposit interest expense       —       —       —       —         Total net revenues       746       711       35       5         Expenses                                         Distribution expenses       288       274       14       5         Amortization of deferred acquisition costs       4       3       1       33         General and administrative expense       310       303       7       2         Total expenses       602       580       22       4         Operating earnings       $   144       $   131       $   13       10   %      Our Asset Management segment pretax operating earnings, which exclude net realized gains or losses and integration charges, increased $13 million, or 10%, to $144 million for the three months ended March 31, 2013 compared to $131 million for the prior year period reflecting equity market appreciation and continued revenue enhancements related to various pricing adjustments and expense re-engineering, partially offset by the impact of net outflows.   Net Revenues   Net revenues increased $35 million, or 5%, to $746 million for the three months ended March 31, 2013 compared to $711 million for the prior year period driven by an increase in management and financial advice fees.   Management and financial advice fees increased $41 million, or 7%, to $627 million for the three months ended March 31, 2013 compared to $586 million for the prior year period primarily due to an increase in assets under management, as well as revenue enhancements related to various pricing adjustments. Average assets under management increased 3% compared to the prior year period driven by equity market appreciation, partially offset by net outflows and the negative impact of foreign currency translation. See our discussion above on the changes in assets under management.   Expenses   Total expenses, which exclude integration charges, increased $22 million, or 4%, to $602 million for the three months ended March 31, 2013 compared to $580 million for the prior year period primarily due to an increase in distribution expenses driven by higher retail fund assets and an increase in general and administrative expense driven by higher costs associated with Threadneedle’s compensation program and higher project costs, partially offset by re-engineering benefits.   58      Table of Contents   Annuities   Our Annuities segment provides variable and fixed annuity products of RiverSource Life companies to individual clients. We provide our variable annuity products through our advisors, and fixed annuity products are provided through both affiliated and unaffiliated advisors and financial institutions. Revenues for our variable annuity products are primarily earned as fees based on underlying account balances, which are impacted by both market movements and net asset flows. Revenues for our fixed annuity products are primarily earned as net investment income on assets supporting fixed account balances, with profitability significantly impacted by the spread between net investment income earned and interest credited on the fixed account balances. We also earn net investment income on owned assets supporting reserves for immediate annuities and for certain guaranteed benefits offered with variable annuities and on capital supporting the business. Intersegment revenues for this segment reflect fees paid by our Asset Management segment for marketing support and other services provided in connection with the availability of variable insurance trust funds (“VIT Funds”) under the variable annuity contracts. Intersegment expenses for this segment include distribution expenses for services provided by our Advice & Wealth Management segment, as well as expenses for investment management services provided by our Asset Management segment.   Management believes that operating measures, which exclude net realized gains or losses and the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits, net of hedges and the related DSIC and DAC amortization, for our Annuities segment, best reflect the underlying performance of our core operations and facilitate a more meaningful trend analysis. See our discussion on the use of these operating measures in the Overview section above.   The following table presents the results of operations of our Annuities segment on an operating basis:              Three Months Ended March 31,                                 2013       2012       Change                 (in millions)         Revenues                                         Management and financial advice fees       $   170        $   160       $   10       6   %     Distribution fees       81        76       5       7         Net investment income       270        293       (23   )   (8   )     Premiums       28        32       (4   )   (13   )     Other revenues       81        67       14       21         Total revenues       630        628       2       —         Banking and deposit interest expense       —        —       —       —         Total net revenues       630        628       2       —         Expenses                                         Distribution expenses       101        100       1       1         Interest credited to fixed accounts       164        171       (7   )   (4   )     Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses       116        78       38       49         Amortization of deferred acquisition costs       41        34       7       21         Interest and debt expense       —        1       (1   )   NM         General and administrative expense       52        55       (3   )   (5   )     Total expenses       474        439       35       8         Operating earnings       $   156        $   189       $   (33   )   (17   )%      NM Not Meaningful.   Our Annuities segment pretax operating income, which excludes net realized gains or losses and the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits (net of hedges and the related DSIC and DAC amortization), decreased $33 million, or 17%, to $156 million for the three months ended March 31, 2013 compared to $189 million for the prior year period primarily due to higher benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses. Results for the first quarter of 2012 included a benefit of $20 million from variable annuity model updates and enhancements. The market impact on DAC and DSIC was a benefit of $14 million in the first quarter of 2013 compared to a benefit of $24 million in the prior year period.   RiverSource variable annuity account balances increased 6% to $70.9 billion at March 31, 2013 compared to the prior year period driven by market appreciation. Variable annuity net outflows of $193 million for the first quarter of 2013 reflected the closed book of annuities previously sold through third parties and $36 million of net inflows in the Ameriprise channel. RiverSource fixed annuity account balances declined 3% to $13.7 billion due to ongoing net outflows resulting from low client demand given current interest rates.   59      Table of Contents   Net Revenues   Net revenues, which exclude net realized gains or losses, increased $2 million to $630 million for the three months ended March 31, 2013 compared to $628 million for the prior year period.   Management and financial advice fees increased $10 million, or 6%, to $170 million for the three months ended March 31, 2013 compared to $160 million for the prior year period due to higher fees on variable annuities driven by higher separate account balances. Average variable annuities contract accumulation values increased $4.5 billion, or 7%, from the prior year period due to market appreciation.   Net investment income, which excludes net realized gains or losses, decreased $23 million, or 8%, to $270 million for the three months ended March 31, 2013 compared to $293 million for the prior year period due to a $21 million decrease in investment income on fixed maturities primarily reflecting a decrease of approximately $14 million from lower invested assets and approximately $10 million from lower interest rates.   Other revenues increased $14 million, or 21%, to $81 million for the three months ended March 31, 2013 compared to $67 million for the prior year period due to higher fees from variable annuity guarantees driven by higher volumes and higher fee rates.   Expenses   Total expenses, which exclude the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits (net of hedges and the related DSIC and DAC amortization) increased $35 million, or 8%, to $474 million for the three months ended March 31, 2013 compared to $439 million for the prior year period due to an increase in benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses.   Interest credited to fixed accounts decreased $7 million, or 4%, to $164 million for the three months ended March 31, 2013 compared to $171 million for the prior year period driven by a lower average crediting rate on interest sensitive fixed annuities and lower average fixed annuity account balances. The average fixed annuity crediting rate excluding capitalized interest decreased to 3.6% for the three months ended March 31, 2013 compared to 3.7% for the prior year period. Average fixed annuities contract accumulation values decreased $414 million, or 3%, to $13.7 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2013 compared to the prior year period due to outflows. Fixed annuities remain in net outflows due to low client demand given existing interest rates.   Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses, which exclude the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits (net of hedges and the related DSIC amortization), increased $38 million, or 49%, to $116 million for the three months ended March 31, 2013 compared to $78 million for the prior year period primarily due to a benefit of $23 million from variable annuity model updates and enhancements in the first quarter of 2012, as well as higher reserve funding related to higher fees from variable annuity guarantees.   Amortization of DAC, which excludes the DAC offset to the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits, increased $7 million, or 21%, to $41 million for the three months ended March 31, 2013 compared to $34 million for the prior year period due to the market impact on DAC. The market impact on DAC was a benefit of $11 million in the first quarter of 2013 compared to a benefit of $18 million in the prior year period as a result of favorable equity market returns in the first quarter of 2013 compared to favorable equity and bond fund returns in the first quarter of 2012.   60      Table of Contents   Protection   Our Protection segment offers a variety of products to address the protection and risk management needs of our retail clients including life, disability income and property-casualty insurance. Life and disability income products are primarily provided through our advisors. Our property-casualty products are sold primarily through affinity relationships. We issue insurance policies through our life insurance subsidiaries and the Property Casualty companies. The primary sources of revenues for this segment are premiums, fees and charges we receive to assume insurance-related risk. We earn net investment income on owned assets supporting insurance reserves and capital supporting the business. We also receive fees based on the level of assets supporting VUL separate account balances. This segment earns intersegment revenues from fees paid by our Asset Management segment for marketing support and other services provided in connection with the availability of VIT Funds under the VUL contracts. Intersegment expenses for this segment include distribution expenses for services provided by our Advice & Wealth Management segment, as well as expenses for investment management services provided by our Asset Management segment.   The following table presents the results of operations of our Protection segment on an operating basis:              Three Months Ended March 31,                                 2013       2012       Change                 (in millions)         Revenues                                         Management and financial advice fees       $   14       $   14       $   —       —         Distribution fees       22       23       (1   )   (4   )%     Net investment income       111       106       5       5         Premiums       286       273       13       5         Other revenues       105       107       (2   )   (2   )     Total revenues       538       523       15       3         Banking and deposit interest expense       —       1       (1   )   NM         Total net revenues       538       522       16       3         Expenses                                         Distribution expenses       16       15       1       7         Interest credited to fixed accounts       34       35       (1   )   (3   )     Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses       292       278       14       5         Amortization of deferred acquisition costs       29       30       (1   )   (3   )     General and administrative expense       57       57       —       —         Total expenses       428       415       13       3         Operating earnings       $   110       $   107       $   3       3   %      NM Not Meaningful.   Our Protection segment pretax operating income, which excludes net realized gains or losses and the market impact on index universal life benefits (net of hedges and the related DAC amortization, unearned revenue amortization, and the reinsurance accrual), increased $3 million, or 3%, to $110 million for the three months ended March 31, 2013 compared to $107 million for the prior year period as an increase in life and health earnings was largely offset by lower auto and home earnings.   Net Revenues   Net revenues, which exclude net realized gains or losses and the unearned revenue amortization and the reinsurance accrual offset to the market impact on index universal life benefits, increased $16 million, or 3%, to $538 million for the three months ended March 31, 2013 compared to $522 million for the prior year period primarily due to growth in auto and home premiums.   Premiums increased $13 million, or 5%, to $286 million for the three months ended March 31, 2013 compared to $273 million for the prior year period primarily due to growth in auto and home premiums driven by continued strong new policy sales growth across market segments, primarily from our affinity relationships with Costco and Progressive. Auto and home policy counts increased 9% year-over-year.   61      Table of Contents   Expenses   Total expenses, which exclude the market impact on index universal life benefits (net of hedges and the related DAC amortization), increased $13 million, or 3%, to $428 million for the three months ended March 31, 2013 compared to $415 million for the prior year period due to an increase in benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses.   Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses, which exclude the market impact on index universal life benefits (net of hedges), increased $14 million, or 5%, to $292 million for the three months ended March 31, 2013 compared to $278 million for the prior year period due to higher expenses related to our auto and home business, partially offset by favorable disability income and long-term care claims experience. Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses related to our auto and home business increased compared to the prior year period primarily due to increased reserves for auto liability loss development and growth in exposure due to higher sales.   Corporate & Other   Our Corporate & Other segment consists of net investment income or loss on corporate level assets, including excess capital held in our subsidiaries and other unallocated equity and other revenues as well as unallocated corporate expenses. The Corporate & Other segment also includes revenues and expenses of CIEs, which are excluded on an operating basis.   The following table presents the results of operations of our Corporate & Other segment on an operating basis:              Three Months Ended March 31,                                 2013       2012       Change                 (in millions)         Revenues                                         Net investment income (loss)       $   (6   )   $   4       $   (10   )   NM         Other revenues       3       4       (1   )   (25   )%     Total revenues       (3   )   8       (11   )   NM         Banking and deposit interest expense       —       —       —       —         Total net revenues       (3   )   8       (11   )   NM         Expenses                                         Distribution expenses       1       —       1       NM         Interest and debt expense       25       22       3       14         General and administrative expense       52       51       1       2         Total expenses       78       73       5       7         Operating loss       $   (81   )   $   (65   )   $   (16   )   (25   )%      NM Not Meaningful.   Our Corporate & Other segment pretax operating loss excludes net realized gains or losses, the impact of consolidating CIEs and restructuring charges. Our Corporate & Other segment pretax operating loss was $81 million for the three months ended March 31, 2013 compared to $65 million for the prior year period. Operating losses for the first quarter of 2013 included a loss of $11 million primarily due to how we account for the transfer of former bank assets. Approximately $8 million of this loss was reflected in net investment loss and approximately $3 million was reflected in general and administrative expense. The loss of $8 million in the Corporate & Other segment was offset by the associated incremental accretion income, primarily in the Annuities segment, that relates to the transfer of the bank assets and eliminates on a consolidated basis.   Market Risk   Our primary market risk exposures are interest rate, equity price, foreign currency exchange rate and credit risk. Equity price and interest rate fluctuations can have a significant impact on our results of operations, primarily due to the effects they have on the asset management and other asset-based fees we earn, the spread income generated on our annuities, brokerage client cash balances and face amount certificate products and UL insurance products, the value of DAC and DSIC assets, the value of liabilities for guaranteed benefits associated with our variable annuities and the value of derivatives held to hedge these benefits.   The guaranteed benefits associated with our variable annuities are GMWB, guaranteed minimum accumulation benefits (“GMAB”), guaranteed minimum death benefits (“GMDB”) and guaranteed minimum income benefits (“GMIB”). Each of these guaranteed benefits guarantees payouts to the annuity holder under certain specific conditions regardless of the performance of the underlying investment assets.   We continue to utilize a hedging program which attempts to match the sensitivity of the assets with the sensitivity of the liabilities. This approach works with the premise that matched sensitivities will produce a highly effective hedging result. Our comprehensive hedging program focuses mainly on first order sensitivities of assets and liabilities; Equity Market Level (Delta), Interest Rate Level (Rho) and Volatility (Vega). Additionally, various second order sensitivities are managed. We use various index options across the term structure, interest rate swaps and swaptions, total return swaps and    62      Table of Contents   futures to manage the risk exposures. The exposures are measured and monitored daily, and adjustments to the hedge portfolio are made as necessary.   To evaluate interest rate and equity price risk we perform sensitivity testing which measures the impact on pretax income from the sources listed below for a 12-month period following a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates or a hypothetical 10% decline in equity prices. The interest rate risk test assumes a sudden 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve, with rates then staying at those levels for the next 12 months. The equity price risk test assumes a sudden 10% drop in equity prices, with equity prices then staying at those levels for the next 12 months. In estimating the values of variable annuity riders, equity indexed annuities, stock market certificates, indexed universal life insurance and the associated hedge assets, we assumed no change in implied market volatility despite the 10% drop in equity prices.   The following tables present our estimate of the impact on pretax income from these hypothetical market movements as of March 31, 2013:              Equity Price Exposure to Pretax Income         Equity Price Decline 10%       Before Hedge Impact       Hedge Impact       Net Impact                 (in millions)         Asset-based management and distribution fees (1)       $   (216   )   $   13       $   (203   )     DAC and DSIC amortization (2) (3)       (82   )   —       (82   )     Variable annuity riders:                                 GMDB and GMIB (3)       (53   )   —       (53   )     GMWB       (107   )   128       21         GMAB       (46   )   57       11         DAC and DSIC amortization (4)       N/A       N/A       (7   )     Total variable annuity riders       (206   )   185       (28   )     Equity indexed annuities       1       (1   )   —         Certificates       3       (3   )   —         Indexed universal life insurance       5       (5   )   —         Total       $   (495   )   $   189       $   (313   )                 Interest Rate Exposure to Pretax Income         Interest Rate Increase 100 Basis Points       Before Hedge Impact       Hedge Impact       Net Impact                 (in millions)         Asset-based management and distribution fees (1)       $   (42   )   $   —       $   (42   )     Variable annuity riders:                                 GMWB       583       (561   )   22         GMAB       34       (33   )   1         DAC and DSIC amortization (4)       N/A       N/A       (5   )     Total variable annuity riders       617       (594   )   18         Fixed annuities, fixed portion of variable annuities and fixed insurance products       86       —       86         Brokerage client cash balances       120       —       120         Certificates       (3   )   —       (3   )     Indexed universal life insurance       6       —       6         Total       $   784       $   (594   )   $   185           N/A Not Applicable. (1) Excludes incentive income which is impacted by market and fund performance during the period and cannot be readily estimated. (2) Market impact on DAC and DSIC amortization resulting from lower projected profits. (3) In estimating the impact on DAC and DSIC amortization resulting from lower projected profits, we have not changed our assumed equity asset growth rates. This is a significantly more conservative estimate than if we assumed management follows its mean reversion guideline and increased near-term rates to recover the drop in equity values over a five-year period. We make this same conservative assumption in estimating the impact from GMDB and GMIB riders. (4) Market impact on DAC and DSIC amortization related to variable annuity riders is modeled net of hedge impact.   The above results compare to an estimated negative net impact to pretax income of $318 million related to a 10% equity price decline and an estimated positive net impact to pretax income of $185 million related to a 100 basis point increase in interest rates as of March 31, 2013.   63      Table of Contents   Net impacts shown in the above table from GMWB and GMAB riders result largely from differences between the liability valuation basis and the hedging basis. Liabilities are valued using fair value accounting principles, with key policyholder behavior assumptions loaded to provide risk margins and with discount rates increased to reflect a current market estimate of our risk of nonperformance specific to these liabilities. For variable annuity riders introduced prior to mid-2009, management elected to hedge based on best estimate policyholder behavior assumptions. For riders issued since mid-2009, management has been hedging on a basis that includes risk margins related to policyholder behavior. The nonperformance spread risk is not hedged.   Actual results could differ materially from those illustrated above as they are based on a number of estimates and assumptions. These include assuming that implied market volatility does not change when equity prices fall by 10%, that management does not increase assumed equity asset growth rates to anticipate recovery of the drop in equity values when valuing DAC, DSIC and GMDB and GMIB liability values and that the 100 basis point increase in interest rates is a parallel shift of the yield curve. Furthermore, we have not tried to anticipate changes in client preferences for different types of assets or other changes in client behavior, nor have we tried to anticipate actions management might take to increase revenues or reduce expenses in these scenarios.   The selection of a 100 basis point interest rate increase as well as a 10% equity price decline should not be construed as a prediction of future market events. Impacts of larger or smaller changes in interest rates or equity prices may not be proportional to those shown for a 100 basis point increase in interest rates or a 10% decline in equity prices.   Fair Value Measurements   We report certain assets and liabilities at fair value; specifically, separate account assets, derivatives, embedded derivatives, properties held by our consolidated property funds, and most investments and cash equivalents. Fair value assumes the exchange of assets or liabilities occurs in orderly transactions and is not the result of a forced liquidation or distressed sale. We include actual market prices, or observable inputs, in our fair value measurements to the extent available. Broker quotes are obtained when quotes from pricing services are not available. We validate prices obtained from third parties through a variety of means such as: price variance analysis, subsequent sales testing, stale price review, price comparison across pricing vendors and due diligence reviews of vendors. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our fair value measurements.   Fair Value of Liabilities and Nonperformance Risk   Companies are required to measure the fair value of liabilities at the price that would be received to transfer the liability to a market participant (an exit price). Since there is not a market for our obligations of our variable annuity riders and indexed universal life insurance, we consider the assumptions participants in a hypothetical market would make to reflect an exit price. As a result, we adjust the valuation of variable annuity riders and indexed universal life insurance by updating certain contractholder assumptions, adding explicit margins to provide for profit, risk and expenses, and adjusting the rates used to discount expected cash flows to reflect a current market estimate of our nonperformance risk. The nonperformance risk adjustment is based on broker quotes for credit default swaps that are adjusted to estimate the risk of our life insurance company subsidiaries not fulfilling these liabilities. Consistent with general market conditions, this estimate resulted in a spread over the LIBOR swap curve as of March 31, 2013. As our estimate of this spread widens or tightens, the liability will decrease or increase. If this nonperformance credit spread moves to a zero spread over the LIBOR swap curve, the reduction to net income would be approximately $154 million, net of DAC, DSIC and unearned revenue amortization, the reinsurance accrual and income taxes (calculated at the statutory tax rate of 35%), based on March 31, 2013 credit spreads.   Liquidity and Capital Resources   Overview   We maintained substantial liquidity during the three months ended March 31, 2013. At March 31, 2013, we had $2.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents compared to $2.4 billion at December 31, 2012. We have additional liquidity available through an unsecured revolving credit facility for up to $500 million that expires in November 2015. Under the terms of the underlying credit agreement, we can increase this facility to $750 million upon satisfaction of certain approval requirements. Available borrowings under this facility are reduced by any outstanding letters of credit. At March 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012, we had no outstanding borrowings under this credit facility and had $2 million of outstanding letters of credit. Our junior subordinated notes due 2066 and credit facility contain various administrative, reporting, legal and financial covenants. We were in compliance with all such covenants at both March 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012.   We enter into short-term borrowings, which may include repurchase agreements and Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) advances, to reduce reinvestment risk from higher levels of expected annuity net cash flows. Short-term borrowings allow us to receive cash to reinvest in longer-duration assets, while paying back the short-term debt with cash flows generated by the fixed   64      Table of Contents   income portfolio. The balance of repurchase agreements at March 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012 was $200 million and $501 million, respectively, which is collateralized with agency residential mortgage backed securities and commercial mortgage backed securities from our investment portfolio. Our subsidiary, RiverSource Life Insurance Company (“RiverSource Life”), is a member of the FHLB of Des Moines, which provides access to collateralized borrowings. As of March 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012, we had $300 million and nil, respectively, of borrowings from the FHLB, which is collateralized with commercial mortgage backed securities. We believe cash flows from operating activities, available cash balances and our availability of revolver borrowings will be sufficient to fund our operating liquidity needs.   Dividends from Subsidiaries   Ameriprise Financial is primarily a parent holding company for the operations carried out by our wholly owned subsidiaries. Because of our holding company structure, our ability to meet our cash requirements, including the payment of dividends on our common stock, substantially depends upon the receipt of dividends or return of capital from our subsidiaries, particularly our life insurance subsidiary, RiverSource Life, our face-amount certificate subsidiary, Ameriprise Certificate Company (“ACC”), AMPF Holding Corporation, which is the parent company of our retail introducing broker-dealer subsidiary, Ameriprise Financial Services, Inc. (“AFSI”) and our clearing broker-dealer subsidiary, American Enterprise Investment Services, Inc. (“AEIS”), our Auto and Home insurance subsidiary, IDS Property Casualty Insurance Company (“IDS Property Casualty”), doing business as Ameriprise Auto & Home Insurance, our transfer agent subsidiary, Columbia Management Investment Services Corp., our investment advisory company, Columbia Management Investment Advisers, LLC, and Threadneedle. The payment of dividends by many of our subsidiaries is restricted and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to regulatory capital requirements.   Actual capital and regulatory capital requirements for our wholly owned subsidiaries subject to regulatory capital requirements were as follows:              Actual Capital       Regulatory Capital Requirements                 March 31, 2013       December 31, 2012       March 31, 2013       December 31, 2012                 (in millions)         RiverSource Life(1)(2)       $   3,018       $   3,257       N/A       $   620         RiverSource Life of NY(1)(2)       262       256       N/A       44         IDS Property Casualty(1)(3)       475       462       $   164       160         Ameriprise Insurance Company(1)(3)       43       43       2       2         ACC(4)(5)       213       204       200       187         Threadneedle(6)       262       183       140       156         Ameriprise National Trust Bank(7)       13       142       4       14         AFSI(3)(4)       126       88       2       2         Ameriprise Captive Insurance Company(3)       59       59       16       12         Ameriprise Trust Company(3)       52       48       50       47         AEIS(3)(4)       103       114       40       39         RiverSource Distributors, Inc.(3)(4)       22       25       #       #         Columbia Management Investment Distributors, Inc.(3)(4)       30       29       #       #                           N/A Not applicable. # Amounts are less than $1 million.

(6) Actual capital and regulatory capital requirements are determined in accordance with U.K. regulatory legislation. The actual capital and the regulatory capital requirements at December 31, 2012 represent management’s assessment at March 31, 2013 of the risk based requirements, as specified by FSA regulations and submitted to the FSA in December 2013. (7) In January 2013, we completed the conversion of our federal savings bank subsidiary, Ameriprise Bank, FSB, to a limited powers national trust bank, which conversion included changing the name of this subsidiary to Ameriprise National Trust Bank. As of March 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012, this subsidiary was required to maintain capital in compliance with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”) regulations and policies.   65      Table of Contents   In addition to the particular regulations restricting dividend payments and establishing subsidiary capitalization requirements, we take into account the overall health of the business, capital levels and risk management considerations in determining a dividend strategy for payments to our company from our subsidiaries, and in deciding to use cash to make capital contributions to our subsidiaries.   During the three months ended March 31, 2013, the parent holding company received cash dividends or a return of capital from its subsidiaries of $575 million (including $325 million from RiverSource Life and $130 million from Ameriprise Bank) and contributed cash to its subsidiaries of $16 million. During the three months ended March 31, 2012, the parent holding company received cash dividends or a return of capital from its subsidiaries of $311 million (including $225 million from RiverSource Life) and contributed cash to its subsidiaries of $15 million.   Dividends Paid to Shareholders and Share Repurchases   We paid regular quarterly dividends to our shareholders totaling $94 million and $64 million for the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. On April 22, 2013, we announced a quarterly dividend of $0.52 per common share. The dividend will be paid on May 17, 2013 to our shareholders of record at the close of business on May 6, 2013.   On October 24, 2012, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized an expenditure of up to an additional $2.0 billion for the repurchase of shares of our common stock through 2014. As of March 31, 2013, we had $1.8 billion remaining under this share repurchase authorization. We intend to fund share repurchases through existing working capital, capital released from the transition of Ameriprise Bank from a federal savings bank to a limited powers national trust bank, future earnings and other customary financing methods. The share repurchase program does not require the purchase of any minimum number of shares, and depending on market conditions and other factors, these purchases may be commenced or suspended at any time without prior notice. Acquisitions under the share repurchase program may be made in the open market, through privately negotiated transactions or block trades or other means. During the three months ended March 31, 2013, we repurchased a total of 5.2 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $69.00 per share.   Cash Flows   Cash flows of CIEs are reflected in our cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities, investing activities and financing activities. Cash held by CIEs is not available for general use by Ameriprise Financial, nor is Ameriprise Financial cash available for general use by its CIEs. As such, the operating, investing and financing cash flows of the CIEs have no impact to the change in cash and cash equivalents.   Operating Activities   Net cash used in operating activities was $466 million for the three months ended March 31, 2013 compared to net cash provided by operating activities $175 million for the prior year period. Operating cash flows for the first quarter of 2013 included a negative impact of $405 million related to CIEs compared to a positive impact of $14 million for the prior year period. Operating cash flows for the first quarter of 2013 included cash outflows of $121 million due to a decrease in net cash collateral held related to derivative instruments compared to cash outflows of $526 million in the prior year period reflecting the change in market value of our net over-the-counter derivatives after master netting arrangements. See Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our derivative instruments and collateral arrangements.
