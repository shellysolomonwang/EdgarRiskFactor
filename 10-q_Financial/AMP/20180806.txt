Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2017 10-K and other factors as discussed herein.Equity price, credit market and interest rate fluctuations can have a significant impact on our results of operations, primarily due to the effects they have on the asset management and other asset-based fees we earn, the “spread” income generated on our fixed deferred annuities, fixed insurance, deposit products and the fixed portion of variable annuities and variable insurance contracts, the value of deferred acquisition costs (“DAC”) and deferred sales inducement costs (“DSIC”) assets, the values of liabilities for guaranteed benefits associated with our variable annuities and the values of derivatives held to hedge these benefits.Earnings, as well as adjusted operating earnings, will be negatively impacted by the ongoing low interest rate environment should it continue. In addition to continuing spread compression in our interest sensitive product lines, a sustained low interest rate environment may result in increases to our reserves and changes in various rate assumptions we use to amortize DAC and DSIC, which may negatively impact our adjusted operating earnings. For additional discussion on our interest rate risk, see Item 3. “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.”We consolidate certain variable interest entities for which we provide asset management services. These entities are defined as consolidated investment entities (“CIEs”). While the consolidation of the CIEs impacts our balance sheet and income statement, our exposure to these entities is unchanged and there is no impact to the underlying business results. For further information on CIEs, see Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. The results of operations of the CIEs are reflected in the Corporate & Other segment. On a consolidated basis, the management fees we earn for the services we provide to the CIEs and the related general and administrative expenses are eliminated and the changes in the fair value of assets and liabilities related to the CIEs, primarily syndicated loans and debt, are reflected in net investment income. We include the fees from these entities in the management and financial advice fees line within our Asset Management segment. While our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), management believes that adjusted operating measures, which exclude net realized investment gains or losses, net of the related DSIC and DAC amortization, unearned revenue amortization and the reinsurance accrual; the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits, net of hedges and the related DSIC and DAC amortization; the market impact on indexed universal life (“IUL”) benefits, net of hedges and the related DAC amortization, unearned revenue amortization and the reinsurance accrual; the market impact on fixed index annuity benefits, net of hedges and the related DAC amortization; the market impact of hedges to offset interest rate changes on unrealized gains or losses for certain investments; integration and restructuring charges; and the impact of consolidating CIEs, best reflect the underlying performance of our core operations and facilitate a more meaningful trend analysis. Management uses certain of these non-GAAP measures to evaluate our financial performance on a basis comparable to that used by some securities analysts and investors. Also, certain of these non-GAAP measures are taken into consideration, to varying degrees, for purposes of business planning and analysis and for certain compensation-related matters. Throughout our Management’s Discussion and Analysis, these non-GAAP measures are referred to as adjusted operating measures. These non-GAAP measures should not be viewed as a substitute for U.S. GAAP measures. Effective January 1, 2018, the Company changed the naming convention for its non-GAAP 57AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. financial measures from “operating” to “adjusted operating” to more clearly differentiate between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. The definition of these measures remains unchanged. It is management’s priority to increase shareholder value over a multi-year horizon by achieving our on-average, over-time financial targets.Our financial targets are:•Adjusted operating total net revenue growth of 6% to 8%,•Adjusted operating earnings per diluted share growth of 12% to 15%, and•Adjusted operating return on equity excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) of 19% to 23%.The following tables reconcile our GAAP measures to adjusted operating measures:  Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30,2018 2017 2018 2017(in millions)Total net revenues$3,196 $3,012 $6,364 $5,938Less: Revenue attributable to CIEs49 25 71 47Less: Net realized investment gains (losses)5 21 11 38Less: Market impact on indexed universal life benefits(10) (3) 3 (2)Less: Market impact of hedges on investments5 (8) 21 (7)Adjusted operating total net revenues$3,147 $2,977 $6,258 $5,862 Three Months Ended June 30, Per Diluted ShareThree Months Ended June 30,2018 20172018 2017(in millions, except per share amounts)Net income$462 $393 $3.10 $2.50Add: Integration/restructuring charges (1)4 — 0.03 —Add: Market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits (1)80 80 0.53 0.51Add: Market impact on indexed universal life benefits (1)20 6 0.13 0.04Add: Market impact of hedges on investments (1)(5) 8 (0.03) 0.05Less: Net realized investment gains (losses) (1)5 20 0.03 0.13Tax effect of adjustments (2)(20) (26) (0.13) (0.17)Adjusted operating earnings$536 $441 $3.60 $2.80        Weighted average common shares outstanding:       Basic147.0 155.1    Diluted149.0 157.5    58AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC.

The Department of Labor (“DOL”) published regulations in April 2016 that expanded the scope of who is considered an ERISA fiduciary and these regulations focused in large part on investment recommendations made by financial advisors, registered investment advisors, and other investment professionals to retirement investors, how financial advisors are able to discuss IRA rollovers, as well as how financial advisors and affiliates can transact with retirement investors. Tax qualified accounts, particularly IRAs, make up a significant portion of our assets under management and administration. However, on March 15, 2018, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit issued a decision vacating the Department’s regulations in its entirety. The Fifth Circuit’s decision became effective when it issued its mandate on June 21, 2018. While the Department’s fiduciary regulation has been vacated, the SEC recently proposed its own fiduciary standard that would apply to recommendations made by financial advisors who work on a commission basis and would apply regardless of the type of account (IRA or non-qualified) an investor holds. Furthermore, several states have either issued their own fiduciary rules or are considering doing so and those rules may extend to certain types of products (e.g. insurance and annuities, financial planning, etc.) or may broadly cover all recommendations made by financial advisors. The Certified Financial Planner Board has issued its own fiduciary standard that applies to financial advisors who hold a Certified Financial Planner designation. Currently, Ameriprise has approximately 4,100 financial advisors that hold a Certified Financial Planner designation. In light of the various fiduciary rules and regulations that have been proposed or finalized, we continue to exert significant efforts to evaluate and prepare to comply with each rule.Critical Accounting EstimatesThe accounting and reporting policies that we use affect our Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of our accounting and reporting policies are critical to an understanding of our consolidated results of operations and financial condition and, in some cases, the application of these policies can be significantly affected by the estimates, judgments and assumptions made by management during the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements. These accounting policies are discussed in detail in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis — Critical Accounting Estimates” in our 2017 10-K.Recent Accounting PronouncementsFor information regarding recent accounting pronouncements and their expected impact on our future consolidated results of operations and financial condition, see Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.Assets Under Management and AdministrationAssets under management (“AUM”) include external client assets for which we provide investment management services, such as the assets of the Columbia Threadneedle Investments funds, assets of institutional clients and assets of clients in our advisor platform held in wrap accounts as well as assets managed by sub-advisors selected by us. AUM also includes certain assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets for which we provide investment management services and recognize management fees in our Asset Management segment, such as the assets of the general account and the variable product funds held in the separate accounts of our life insurance subsidiaries and CIEs. These assets do not include assets under advisement, for which we provide model portfolios but do not have full discretionary investment authority. Assets under administration (“AUA”) include assets for which we provide administrative services such as client assets invested in other companies’ products that we offer outside of our wrap accounts. These assets include those held in clients’ brokerage accounts. We generally record revenues received from administered assets as distribution fees. We do not exercise management discretion over these assets and do not earn a management fee. These assets are not reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. AUA also includes certain assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets for which we do not provide investment management services and do not recognize management fees, such as investments in non-affiliated funds held in the separate accounts of our life insurance subsidiaries. These assets do not include assets under advisement, for which we provide model portfolios but do not have full discretionary investment authority.The following table presents detail regarding our AUM and AUA: June 30, Change2018 2017(in billions)  Assets Under Management and Administration       Advice & Wealth Management AUM$257.2 $221.1 $36.1 16 %Asset Management AUM482.1 472.6 9.5 2Corporate & Other AUM— 0.3 (0.3) NMEliminations(28.7) (24.5) (4.2) (17)Total Assets Under Management710.6 669.5 41.1 6Total Assets Under Administration180.3 165.2 15.1 9Total AUM and AUA$890.9 $834.7 $56.2 7 %NM Not Meaningful.60AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. Total AUM increased $41.1 billion, or 6%, to $710.6 billion as of June 30, 2018 compared to $669.5 billion as of June 30, 2017 primarily due to a $36.1 billion increase in Advice & Wealth Management AUM driven by wrap account net inflows and market appreciation and a $9.5 billion increase in Asset Management AUM driven by market appreciation, partially offset by net outflows and retail fund distributions.

Net RevenuesNet revenues increased $184 million, or 6%, to $3.2 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2018 compared to $3.0 billion for the prior year period. Management and financial advice fees increased $123 million, or 8%, to $1.7 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2018 compared to $1.6 billion for the prior year period primarily due to an increase in AUM. Average AUM increased $45.9 billion, or 7%, compared to the prior year period primarily due to equity market appreciation and wrap account net inflows, partially offset by asset management net outflows. See our discussion on the changes in AUM in our segment results of operations section. Distribution fees increased $40 million, or 9%, to $465 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 compared to $425 million for the prior year period primarily due to higher brokerage cash spread due to an increase in short-term interest rates and equity market appreciation.Net investment income increased $28 million, or 7%, to $419 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 compared to $391 million for the prior year period primarily due to a $23 million increase in net investment income from CIEs and a $13 million favorable change in the market impact of hedges on investments, partially offset by a $16 million decrease in net realized investment gains.ExpensesTotal expenses increased $147 million, or 6%, to $2.6 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2018 compared to $2.5 billion for the prior year period.61AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. Distribution expenses increased $71 million, or 9%, to $902 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 compared to $831 million for the prior year period reflecting higher advisor compensation due to equity market appreciation and wrap account net inflows, partially offset by asset management net outflows. Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses increased $24 million, or 4%, to $635 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 compared to $611 million for the prior year period primarily reflecting the following items:•A $13 million increase in auto and home expenses due to a 5% increase in auto policies in force and a higher non-catastrophe loss ratio, partially offset by lower catastrophe losses. Home policies in force decreased 12% compared to the prior year period reflecting the termination of one homeowner affinity partnership along with other actions.•The impact on DSIC and reserves for insurance features in non-traditional long-duration contracts from actual versus expected market performance was a benefit of $5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 compared to a benefit of $10 million for the prior year period.•A $7 million increase in expense related to higher reserve funding driven by the impact of higher variable annuity guaranteed benefit rider charges.Interest and debt expense increased $28 million, or 54%, to $80 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 compared to $52 million for the prior year period due to an increase in interest expense from CIEs. General and administrative expense increased $21 million, or 3%, to $788 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 compared to $767 million for the prior year period primarily due to expenses related to acquisitions and investments for business growth.Income TaxesOur effective tax rate was 15.7% for the three months ended June 30, 2018 compared to 23.1% for the prior year period. See Note 16 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion on income taxes.Results of Operations by Segment for the Three Months Ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 Adjusted operating earnings is the measure of segment profit or loss management uses to evaluate segment performance. Adjusted operating earnings should not be viewed as a substitute for GAAP pretax income. We believe the presentation of segment adjusted operating earnings as we measure it for management purposes enhances the understanding of our business by reflecting the underlying performance of our core operations and facilitating a more meaningful trend analysis. See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the presentation of segment results and our definition of adjusted operating earnings.The following table presents summary financial information by segment: Three Months Ended June 30,2018 2017(in millions)Advice & Wealth Management   Net revenues$1,543 $1,376Expenses1,193 1,085Adjusted operating earnings$350 $291Asset Management   Net revenues$755 $747Expenses572 571Adjusted operating earnings$183 $176Annuities   Net revenues$622 $627Expenses493 485Adjusted operating earnings$129 $142Protection   Net revenues$533 $517Expenses488 466Adjusted operating earnings$45 $51Corporate & Other   Net revenues$56 $55Expenses121 131Adjusted operating loss$(65) $(76)62AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC.

Further, in March 2017 the UK invoked article 50 of the Treaty of Lisbon in serving its relevant notice to leave the European Union on March 30, 2019 and in March 2018 the terms of a transitional agreement, which is intended to be incorporated into the final version of the withdrawal agreement, were published, generally providing for very little change in the UK’s relationship with the EU until the end of 2020. The full impact of the British exit from the EU (commonly known as “Brexit”) remains uncertain and recent political developments regarding the terms of Brexit have created further uncertainty as to whether a transitional agreement will be implemented. This uncertainty may have a negative impact on our UK and European net flows and foreign currency translation if the British Pound weakens.Total segment AUM decreased $3.2 billion, or 1%, during the three months ended June 30, 2018 driven by net outflows of $1.7 billion, retail fund distributions of $3.5 billion and a negative impact of foreign currency translation, partially offset by market appreciation. Net flows in the second quarter of 2018 reflect improved global retail flows and favorable rebalances in model portfolios. Institutional net outflows in the second quarter of 2018 included $1.7 billion of outflows from former parent-related assets and $1.1 billion of CLO redemptions.In November 2017, we completed our acquisition of Lionstone Partners, LLC (“Lionstone Investments”), a leading national real estate 67AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. investment firm, specializing in investment strategies based upon proprietary analytics. This acquisition added $5.4 billion in assets under management.

Net RevenuesNet revenues, which exclude net realized investment gains or losses, increased $8 million, or 1%, to $755 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 compared to $747 million for the prior year period.Management and financial advice fees increased $12 million, or 2%, to $636 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 compared to $624 million for the prior year period driven by equity market appreciation and the acquisition of Lionstone Investments, partially offset by cumulative net outflows from former parent-related assets and higher fee yielding retail funds and a decrease in CLO performance fees. Our average weighted equity index, which is a proxy for equity movements on AUM, increased 12% for the three months ended June 30, 2018 compared to the prior year period. ExpensesTotal expenses were essentially flat at $572 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 compared to $571 million for the prior year period as lower distribution expenses were offset by higher general and administrative expense due to a $7 million increase related to the acquisition of Lionstone Investments.68AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC.

The impact on DAC, DSIC and reserves for insurance features in non-traditional long-duration contracts from actual versus expected market performance was a benefit of $7 million ($2 million for DAC, nil for DSIC and $5 million for insurance features in non-traditional long duration contracts) for the three months ended June 30, 2018 compared to a benefit of $17 million ($7 million for DAC, $2 million for DSIC and $8 million for insurance features in non-traditional long duration contracts) for the prior year period.RiverSource variable annuity account balances increased 1% to $78.3 billion at June 30, 2018 compared to the prior year period due to equity market appreciation, partially offset by net outflows of $3.5 billion. Variable annuity net outflows for the second quarter of 2018 were lower than the prior year period driven by a 16% increase in sales, as well as lower lapses. RiverSource fixed deferred annuity account balances declined 7% to $9.0 billion at June 30, 2018 compared to the prior year period as older policies continue to lapse and new sales are limited due to low interest rates. Given the current interest rate environment, our current fixed deferred annuity book is expected to gradually run off and earnings on our fixed deferred annuity business will trend down.Net RevenuesNet revenues, which exclude net realized investment gains or losses, decreased $5 million, or 1%, to $622 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 compared to $627 million for the prior year period.Net investment income, which excludes net realized investment gains or losses, decreased $14 million, or 8%, to $161 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 compared to $175 million for the prior year period reflecting a decrease of approximately $9 million from lower invested assets due to fixed annuity net outflows and approximately $5 million from lower earned interest rates.69AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. Other revenues increased $9 million, or 7%, to $146 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 compared to $137 million for the prior year period reflecting an increase in variable annuity guaranteed benefit rider charges driven by higher average fee rates on variable annuity guarantee sales and sales in the prior year where the fees start on the first anniversary date. ExpensesTotal expenses, which exclude the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits (net of hedges and the related DSIC and DAC amortization), the market impact on fixed index annuity benefits (net of hedges and the related DAC amortization) and the DAC and DSIC offset to net realized investment gains or losses, increased $8 million, or 2%, to $493 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 compared to $485 million for the prior year period primarily due to an increase in benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses. Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses, which exclude the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits (net of hedges and the related DSIC amortization) and the DSIC offset to net realized investment gains or losses, increased $9 million, or 6%, to $158 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 compared to $149 million for the prior year period due to a $5 million decrease in the favorable impact on DSIC and reserves for insurance features in non-traditional long-duration contracts from actual versus expected market performance and a $7 million increase in expense related to higher reserve funding driven by the impact of higher variable annuity guaranteed benefit rider charges.ProtectionThe following table presents the results of operations of our Protection segment on an adjusted operating basis: Three Months Ended June 30, Change2018 2017(in millions)  Revenues       Management and financial advice fees$13 $12 $1 8 %Distribution fees25 23 2 9Net investment income87 82 5 6Premiums311 297 14 5Other revenues97 103 (6) (6)Total revenues533 517 16 3Banking and deposit interest expense— — — —Total net revenues533 517 16 3Expenses       Distribution expenses19 16 3 19Interest credited to fixed accounts48 47 1 2Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses326 313 13 4Amortization of deferred acquisition costs27 29 (2) (7)Interest and debt expense7 6 1 17General and administrative expense61 55 6 11Total expenses488 466 22 5Adjusted operating earnings$45 $51 $(6) (12)%70AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC.

Total life and health insurance claims increased $2 million compared to the prior year period due to a $6 million increase in life claims partially offset by a $4 million decrease in DI claims.Net RevenuesNet revenues, which exclude net realized investment gains or losses (net of unearned revenue amortization and the reinsurance accrual) and the unearned revenue amortization and reinsurance accrual offset to the market impact on indexed universal life benefits, increased $16 million, or 3%, to $533 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 compared to $517 million for the prior year period primarily due to a $14 million increase in premiums driven by higher auto policies in force.ExpensesTotal expenses, which exclude the market impact on indexed universal life benefits (net of hedges and the related DAC amortization) and the DAC offset to net realized investment gains or losses, increased $22 million, or 5%, to $488 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 compared to $466 million for the prior year period. Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses increased $13 million, or 4%, to $326 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 compared to $313 million for the prior year period primarily due to a 5% increase in auto policies in force and a higher non-catastrophe loss ratio, partially offset by lower catastrophe losses. Catastrophe losses (net of the impact of reinsurance), which were higher than anticipated in both periods due to storms, were $40 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 compared to $44 million for the prior year period. Our reinsurance program resulted in ceded losses of approximately $6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 compared to $32 million for the prior year period. The benefit from our catastrophe reinsurance program was lower as year-to-date catastrophe losses have not yet exceeded the applicable retention limits of our reinsurance arrangements.Corporate & OtherThe following table presents the results of operations of our Corporate & Other segment on an adjusted operating basis: Three Months Ended June 30, Change2018 2017(in millions)  Revenues       Net investment income$30 $29 $1 3 %Premiums27 26 1 4Other revenues— 1 (1) NMTotal revenues57 56 1 2Banking and deposit interest expense1 1 — —Total net revenues56 55 1 2Expenses       Distribution expenses(3) (2) (1) (50)Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses65 62 3 5Amortization of deferred acquisition costs— — — —Interest and debt expense6 6 — —General and administrative expense53 65 (12) (18)Total expenses121 131 (10) (8)Adjusted operating loss$(65) $(76) $11 14 %NM Not Meaningful.71AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. Our Corporate & Other segment pretax adjusted operating loss excludes net realized investment gains or losses, the market impact of hedges to offset interest rate changes on unrealized gains or losses for certain investments, integration and restructuring charges, and the impact of consolidating CIEs. Our Corporate & Other segment pretax adjusted operating loss decreased $11 million, or 14%, to $65 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 compared to $76 million for the prior year period primarily due to a $12 million decrease in general and administrative expense reflecting a $5 million decline in DOL planning and implementation expenses and lower performance-based compensation.Our Corporate & Other segment includes our closed block long term care (“LTC”) insurance, which had a pretax adjusted operating loss of $5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 compared to a loss of $3 million for the prior year period. Claims were in line with expected ranges for the second quarter of 2018.Our LTC insurance has two distinct blocks. Our older generation nursing home indemnity LTC policies were written between 1989 and 1999 and represent half of our policies. As of June 30, 2018, this block had approximately $90 million in gross in-force annual premium and future policyholder benefits and claim reserves of $1.3 billion, net of reinsurance, which was 56% of GAAP reserves. This block has been shrinking over the last few years given the average attained age is 80 and the average attained age of policyholders on claim is 87. Fifty-four percent of the policies in this block have lifetime benefits.Our second generation comprehensive reimbursement LTC polices were written from 1997 until 2002. This block has higher premiums per policy than the nursing home indemnity LTC policies. Thirty-eight percent of the policies in this block have lifetime benefits. The average attained age is 75 overall and the average age of those on claim is 84 for this block. As of June 30, 2018, this block had approximately $116 million in gross in-force annual premium and future policyholder benefits and claim reserves of $1.0 billion, net of reinsurance. We utilize three primary levers to manage our LTC business. First, we have taken an active approach to steadily increasing rates since 2005, with cumulative rate increases of 138% on our nursing home indemnity LTC block and 63% on our comprehensive reimbursement LTC block. Second, we have a reserving process that reflects the policy features and risk characteristics of our blocks. GAAP reserves include approximately $120 million benefit from future rate actions, of which approximately 30% has been approved by regulators. We do not assume any future morbidity improvements nor do we assume any future mortality improvements when calculating our GAAP reserves. We believe that estimating a 5% mortality improvement would have a marginal impact to our LTC GAAP reserve. Our statutory reserves are approximately $400 million higher than our GAAP reserves and includes margins for key assumptions like morbidity and mortality, as well as $165 million in asset adequacy reserves. Lastly, we have prudently managed our investment portfolio by maintaining a liquid, investment grade portfolio that is currently in a net unrealized gain position. In the third quarter, we will complete our customary annual review of experience and update our assumptions in our loss recognition testing. Further discussion of our LTC business and review process of reserves is included in our 2017 10-K.72AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC.

The market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits (net of hedges and the related DSIC and DAC amortization) was an expense of $85 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 compared to an expense of $143 million for the prior year period. Net RevenuesNet revenues increased $426 million, or 7%, to $6.4 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2018 compared to $5.9 billion for the prior year period. Management and financial advice fees increased $305 million, or 10%, to $3.4 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2018 compared to $3.1 billion for the prior year period primarily due to an increase in AUM. Average AUM increased $61.7 billion, or 9%, compared to the prior year period primarily due to equity market appreciation, wrap account net inflows and a positive impact of foreign currency translation, partially offset by asset management net outflows. See our discussion on the changes in AUM in our segment results of operations section. Distribution fees increased $67 million, or 8%, to $933 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 compared to $866 million for the prior year period primarily due to higher brokerage cash spread due to an increase in short-term interest rates and equity market appreciation, partially offset by a $30 million decrease related to our transition to share classes without 12b-1 fees in advisory accounts, which we completed during the first quarter of 2017.Net investment income increased $33 million, or 4%, to $815 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 compared to $782 million for the prior year period primarily due to a $24 million increase in net investment income from CIEs and a $28 million 73AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. favorable change in the market impact of hedges on investments, partially offset by a $27 million decrease in net realized investment gains.Other revenues increased $22 million, or 4%, to $592 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 compared to $570 million for the prior year period primarily due to a vendor credit of $14 million and an increase in variable annuity guaranteed benefit rider charges. ExpensesTotal expenses increased $168 million, or 3%, to $5.1 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2018 compared to $5.0 billion for the prior year period.Distribution expenses increased $153 million, or 9%, to $1.8 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2018 compared to $1.7 billion for the prior year period reflecting higher advisor compensation due to equity market appreciation and wrap account net inflows, partially offset by asset management net outflows and a $16 million decrease from changes related to our transition to share classes without 12b-1 fees in advisory accounts. Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses decreased $49 million, or 4%, to $1.1 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2018 compared to $1.2 billion for the prior year period primarily reflecting the following items:•An $83 million decrease in expense from the unhedged nonperformance credit spread risk adjustment on variable annuity guaranteed benefits. The favorable impact of the nonperformance credit spread was $11 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 compared to an unfavorable impact of $72 million for the prior year period. As the estimate of the nonperformance credit spread over the LIBOR swap curve tightens or widens, the embedded derivative liability will increase or decrease. As the embedded derivative liability on which the nonperformance credit spread is applied increases (decreases), the impact of the nonperformance credit spread is favorable (unfavorable) to expense. •A $12 million increase in expense from other market impacts on variable annuity guaranteed benefits, net of hedges in place to offset those risks and the related DSIC amortization. This increase was the result of an unfavorable $38 million change in the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits reserves, a favorable $30 million change in the market impact on derivatives hedging the variable annuity guaranteed benefits and an unfavorable $4 million change in the DSIC offset. The main market drivers contributing to these changes are summarized below:•Equity market impact on the variable annuity guaranteed living benefits liability net of the impact on the corresponding hedge assets resulted in a higher expense in the first half of 2018 compared to the prior year period.•Interest rate impact on the variable annuity guaranteed living benefits liability net of the impact on the corresponding hedge assets resulted in a benefit in the first half of 2018 compared to an expense in the prior year period.•Volatility impact on the variable annuity guaranteed living benefits liability net of the impact on the corresponding hedge assets resulted in a lower expense in the first half of 2018 compared to the prior year period.•Other unhedged items, including the difference between the assumed and actual underlying separate account investment performance, fixed income credit exposures, transaction costs and various behavioral items, were a net unfavorable impact compared to the prior year period.•A $13 million increase in auto and home expenses due to a 5% increase in auto policies in force and a higher non-catastrophe loss ratio, partially offset by lower catastrophe losses. •The impact on DSIC and reserves for insurance features in non-traditional long-duration contracts from actual versus expected market performance was a benefit of $11 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 compared to a benefit of $20 million for the prior year period.•A $13 million increase in expense related to higher reserve funding driven by the impact of higher variable annuity guaranteed benefit rider charges. Interest and debt expense increased $29 million, or 28%, to $131 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 compared to $102 million for the prior year period due to an increase in interest expense from CIEs. General and administrative expense increased $33 million, or 2%, to $1.6 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2018 compared to $1.5 billion for the prior year period primarily due to expenses related to acquisitions, a $13 million negative foreign currency translation impact and investments for business growth, partially offset by a $12 million decline in DOL planning and implementation expenses and a $9 million expense in the prior year period related to the renegotiation of a vendor arrangement.Income TaxesOur effective tax rate was 15.2% for the six months ended June 30, 2018 compared to 19.3% for the prior year period.

Total segment AUM net outflows included $3.8 billion of outflows of former parent-related assets. Global retail net outflows of $2.6 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2018 included $1.4 billion of outflows of our variable product funds underlying insurance and annuity separate accounts and $1.1 billion of outflows from former parent-related assets. Global institutional net outflows of $6.8 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2018 included $2.7 billion of outflows from former parent-related assets and $1.2 billion of CLO redemptions. Net outflows were elevated primarily from redemptions from institutional clients that were driven by shifts in asset allocation decisions away from equity and high yield products, as well as from an institutional client seeking liquidity.The following table presents the results of operations of our Asset Management segment on an adjusted operating basis: Six Months Ended June 30, Change2018 2017(in millions)  Revenues       Management and financial advice fees$1,281 $1,221 $60 5 %Distribution fees224 233 (9) (4)Net investment income10 10 — —Other revenues18 8 10 NMTotal revenues1,533 1,472 61 4Banking and deposit interest expense— — — —Total net revenues1,533 1,472 61 4Expenses       Distribution expenses490 503 (13) (3)Amortization of deferred acquisition costs7 8 (1) (13)Interest and debt expense12 11 1 9General and administrative expense646 624 22 4Total expenses1,155 1,146 9 1Adjusted operating earnings$378 $326 $52 16 %NM Not Meaningful.Our Asset Management segment pretax adjusted operating earnings, which exclude net realized investment gains or losses, increased $52 million, or 16%, to $378 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 compared to $326 million for the prior year period primarily due to equity market appreciation and a $14 million vendor credit, partially offset by the cumulative impact of net outflows.

Other revenues decreased $14 million, or 7%, to $193 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 compared to $207 million for the prior year period primarily due to higher cost of reinsurance for life insurance products.ExpensesTotal expenses, which exclude the market impact on indexed universal life benefits (net of hedges and the related DAC amortization) and the DAC offset to net realized investment gains or losses, increased $13 million, or 1%, to $937 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 compared to $924 million for the prior year period. Interest credited to fixed accounts increased $6 million, or 7%, to $97 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 compared to $91 million for the prior year period primarily due to higher fixed account values associated with life insurance.Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses increased $8 million, or 1%, to $618 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 compared to $610 million for the prior year period primarily due to a 5% increase in auto policies in force and a higher non-catastrophe loss ratio, partially offset by lower catastrophe losses and life and health insurance claims. Life and health insurance claims decreased $5 million compared to the prior year period due to a $10 million decrease in DI claims, partially offset by a $5 million increase in life claims. Catastrophe losses (net of the impact of reinsurance), which were higher than anticipated in both periods due to storms, were $54 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 compared to $69 million for the prior year period. Our reinsurance program resulted in ceded losses of approximately $9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 compared to $44 million for the prior year period. The benefit from our catastrophe reinsurance program was lower as year-to-date catastrophe losses have not yet exceeded the applicable retention limits of our reinsurance arrangements.Corporate & OtherThe following table presents the results of operations of our Corporate & Other segment on an adjusted operating basis: Six Months Ended June 30, Change2018 2017(in millions)  Revenues       Net investment income$60 $57 $3 5 %Premiums53 53 — —Other revenues2 3 (1) (33)Total revenues115 113 2 2Banking and deposit interest expense2 1 1 NMTotal net revenues113 112 1 1Expenses       Distribution expenses(5) (5) — —Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses121 120 1 1Amortization of deferred acquisition costs— — — —Interest and debt expense12 14 (2) (14)General and administrative expense106 139 (33) (24)Total expenses234 268 (34) (13)Adjusted operating loss$(121) $(156) $35 22 %NM Not Meaningful.81AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC.

Our Corporate & Other segment pretax adjusted operating loss decreased $35 million, or 22%, to $121 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 compared to $156 million for the prior year period primarily due to a $33 million decrease in general and administrative expense reflecting a $12 million decline in DOL planning and implementation expenses, lower performance-based compensation, lower project-related costs and a $9 million expense in the prior year period related to the renegotiation of a vendor arrangement.Our LTC insurance had a pretax adjusted operating loss of $3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 compared to a loss of $2 million for the prior year period. For additional discussion on LTC insurance, see our Corporate & Other segment results of operations for the three months ended June 30, 2018.Market RiskOur primary market risk exposures are interest rate, equity price, foreign currency exchange rate and credit risk. Equity price and interest rate fluctuations can have a significant impact on our results of operations, primarily due to the effects they have on the asset management and other asset-based fees we earn, the spread income generated on our fixed deferred annuities, fixed insurance, brokerage client cash balances, face-amount certificate products and the fixed portion of our variable annuities and variable insurance contracts, the value of DAC and DSIC assets, the value of liabilities for guaranteed benefits associated with our variable annuities and the value of derivatives held to hedge these benefits.Our earnings from fixed deferred annuities, fixed insurance, and the fixed portion of variable annuities and variable insurance contracts are based upon the spread between rates earned on assets held and the rates at which interest is credited to accounts. We primarily invest in fixed rate securities to fund the rate credited to clients. We guarantee an interest rate to the holders of these products. Investment assets and client liabilities generally differ as it relates to basis, repricing or maturity characteristics. Rates credited to clients’ accounts generally reset at shorter intervals than the yield on the underlying investments. Therefore, in an increasing interest rate environment, higher interest rates may be reflected in crediting rates to clients sooner than in rates earned on invested assets, which could result in a reduced spread between the two rates, reduced earned income and a negative impact on pretax income. However, the current low interest rate environment is resulting in interest rates below the level of some of our liability guaranteed minimum interest rates (“GMIRs”). Hence, a modest rise in interest rates would not necessarily result in changes to all the liability credited rates while projected asset purchases would capture the full increase in interest rates. This dynamic would result in widening spreads under a modestly rising rate scenario given the current relationship between the current level of interest rates and the underlying GMIRs on the business. As a result of the low interest rate environment, our current reinvestment yields are generally lower than the current portfolio yield. We expect our portfolio income yields to continue to decline in future periods if interest rates remain low. The carrying value and weighted average yield of total non-structured fixed maturity securities, certificate of deposits and commercial mortgage loans in our investment portfolio that may generate proceeds to reinvest through June 30, 2020 due to prepayment, maturity or call activity at the option of the issuer, excluding securities with a make-whole provision, were $5.4 billion and 3.8%, respectively, as of June 30, 2018. In addition, residential mortgage-backed securities, which are subject to prepayment risk as a result of the low interest rate environment, totaled $6.0 billion and had a weighted average yield of 3.0% as of June 30, 2018. While these amounts represent investments that could be subject to reinvestment risk, it is also possible that these investments will be used to fund liabilities or may not be prepaid and will remain invested at their current yields. In addition to the interest rate environment, the mix of benefit payments versus product sales as well as the timing and volumes associated with such mix may impact our investment yield. Furthermore, reinvestment activities and the associated investment yield may also be impacted by corporate strategies implemented at management’s discretion. The average yield for investment purchases during the six months ended June 30, 2018 was approximately 3.1%.The reinvestment of proceeds from maturities, calls and prepayments at rates below the current portfolio yield, which may be below the level of some liability GMIRs, will have a negative impact to future operating results. To mitigate the unfavorable impact that the low interest rate environment has on our spread income, we assess reinvestment risk in our investment portfolio and monitor this risk in accordance with our asset/liability management framework. In addition, we may reduce the crediting rates on our fixed products when warranted, subject to guaranteed minimums.In addition to the fixed rate exposures noted above, RiverSource Life also has the following variable annuity guarantee benefits: guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits (“GMWB”), guaranteed minimum accumulation benefits (“GMAB”), guaranteed minimum death benefits (“GMDB”) and guaranteed minimum income benefits (“GMIB”). Each of these benefits guarantees payouts to the annuity holder under certain specific conditions regardless of the performance of the underlying invested assets.82AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. The variable annuity guarantees continue to be managed by utilizing a hedging program which attempts to match the sensitivity of the assets with the sensitivity of the liabilities. This approach works with the premise that matched sensitivities will produce a highly effective hedging result. Our comprehensive hedging program focuses mainly on first order sensitivities of assets and liabilities: Equity Market Level (Delta), Interest Rate Level (Rho) and Volatility (Vega). Additionally, various second order sensitivities are managed. We use various index options across the term structure, interest rate swaps and swaptions, total return swaps and futures to manage the risk exposures. The exposures are measured and monitored daily, and adjustments to the hedge portfolio are made as necessary.We have a macro hedge program to provide protection against the statutory tail scenario risk arising from variable annuity reserves on our statutory surplus and to cover some of the residual risks not covered by other hedging activities. We assess the residual risk under a range of scenarios in creating and executing the macro hedge program. As a means of economically hedging these risks, we may use a combination of futures, options, swaps and swaptions. Certain of the macro hedge derivatives used contain settlement provisions linked to both equity returns and interest rates; the remaining are interest rate contracts or equity contracts. The macro hedge program could result in additional earnings volatility as changes in the value of the macro hedge derivatives, which are designed to reduce statutory capital volatility, may not be closely aligned to changes in the variable annuity guarantee embedded derivatives.To evaluate interest rate and equity price risk we perform sensitivity testing which measures the impact on pretax income from the sources listed below for a 12-month period following a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates or a hypothetical 10% decline in equity prices. The interest rate risk test assumes a sudden 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve, with rates then staying at those levels for the next 12 months. The equity price risk test assumes a sudden 10% drop in equity prices, with equity prices then staying at those levels for the next 12 months. In estimating the values of variable annuity riders, indexed annuities, stock market certificates, indexed universal life insurance and the associated hedge assets, we assume no change in implied market volatility despite the 10% drop in equity prices.The following tables present our estimate of the impact on pretax income from the above defined hypothetical market movements as of June 30, 2018:Equity Price Decline 10% Equity Price Exposure to Pretax IncomeBefore Hedge Impact Hedge Impact Net Impact  (in millions)Asset-based management and distribution fees (1) $(264) $5 $(259)DAC and DSIC amortization (2)(3) (128) — (128)Variable annuity riders:      GMDB and GMIB (3) (31) — (31)GMWB (3)(4) (414) 252 (162)GMAB (19) 19 —DAC and DSIC amortization (4) N/A N/A (3)Total variable annuity riders (464) 271 (196)Macro hedge program (5) — 39 39Indexed annuities 2 (2) —Certificates 3 (3) —Indexed universal life insurance 69 (58) 11Total $(782) $252 $(533)83AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC.

This is a significantly more conservative estimate than if we assumed management follows its mean reversion guideline and increased near-term rates to recover the drop in equity values over a five-year period. We make this same conservative assumption in estimating the impact from GMDB and GMIB riders and the life contingent benefits associated with GMWB.(4) Market impact on DAC and DSIC amortization related to variable annuity riders is modeled net of hedge impact.(5) The market impact of the macro hedge program is modeled net of any related impact to DAC and DSIC amortization.The above results compare to an estimated negative net impact to pretax income of $551 million related to a 10% equity price decline and an estimated positive net impact to pretax income of $192 million related to a 100 basis point increase in interest rates as of December 31, 2017. The change in interest rate exposure was driven by variable annuity riders primarily due to changes in market rates.Net impacts shown in the above table from GMWB riders result largely from differences between the liability valuation basis and the hedging basis. Liabilities are valued using fair value accounting principles, with risk margins incorporated in contractholder behavior assumptions and with discount rates increased to reflect a current market estimate of our risk of nonperformance specific to these liabilities. Our hedging is based on our determination of economic risk, which excludes certain items in the liability valuation including the nonperformance spread risk.Actual results could differ materially from those illustrated above as they are based on a number of estimates and assumptions. These include assuming that implied market volatility does not change when equity prices fall by 10%; that management does not increase assumed equity asset growth rates to anticipate recovery of the drop in equity values when valuing DAC, DSIC and the liability values associated with GMDB, GMIB and the life contingent benefits associated with GMWB; and that the 100 basis point increase in interest rates is a parallel shift of the yield curve. Furthermore, we have not tried to anticipate changes in client preferences for different types of assets or other changes in client behavior, nor have we tried to anticipate actions management might take to increase revenues or reduce expenses in these scenarios.The selection of a 100 basis point interest rate increase as well as a 10% equity price decline should not be construed as a prediction of future market events. Impacts of larger or smaller changes in interest rates or equity prices may not be proportional to those shown for a 100 basis point increase in interest rates or a 10% decline in equity prices.84AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. Fair Value MeasurementsWe report certain assets and liabilities at fair value; specifically, separate account assets, derivatives, embedded derivatives and most investments and cash equivalents. Fair value assumes the exchange of assets or liabilities occurs in orderly transactions and is not the result of a forced liquidation or distressed sale. We include actual market prices, or observable inputs, in our fair value measurements to the extent available. Broker quotes are obtained when quotes from pricing services are not available. We validate prices obtained from third parties through a variety of means such as: price variance analysis, subsequent sales testing, stale price review, price comparison across pricing vendors and due diligence reviews of vendors. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our fair value measurements.Fair Value of Liabilities and Nonperformance RiskCompanies are required to measure the fair value of liabilities at the price that would be received to transfer the liability to a market participant (an exit price). Since there is not a market for our obligations of our variable annuity riders, indexed annuities and indexed universal life insurance, we consider the assumptions participants in a hypothetical market would make to reflect an exit price. As a result, we adjust the valuation of variable annuity riders, indexed annuities and indexed universal life insurance by updating certain contractholder assumptions, adding explicit margins to provide for profit, risk and expenses, and adjusting the rates used to discount expected cash flows to reflect a current market estimate of our nonperformance risk. The nonperformance risk adjustment is based on observable market data adjusted to estimate the risk of our life insurance company subsidiaries not fulfilling these liabilities. Consistent with general market conditions, this estimate resulted in a spread over the LIBOR swap curve as of June 30, 2018. As our estimate of this spread widens or tightens, the liability will decrease or increase. If this nonperformance credit spread moves to a zero spread over the LIBOR swap curve, the reduction to future net income would be approximately $303 million, net of DAC, DSIC, unearned revenue amortization, the reinsurance accrual and income taxes (calculated at the statutory tax rate of 21%), based on June 30, 2018 credit spreads.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesOverviewWe maintained substantial liquidity during the six months ended June 30, 2018. At June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, we had $2.4 billion and $2.5 billion, respectively, in cash and cash equivalents excluding CIEs. We have additional liquidity available through an unsecured revolving credit facility for up to $750 million that expires in October 2022. Under the terms of the credit agreement, we can increase this facility to $1 billion upon satisfaction of certain approval requirements. Available borrowings under this facility are reduced by any outstanding letters of credit. At June 30, 2018, we had no outstanding borrowings under this credit facility and had $1 million of outstanding letters of credit. Our credit facility contains various administrative, reporting, legal and financial covenants. We were in compliance with all such covenants at June 30, 2018. We enter into short-term borrowings, which may include repurchase agreements and Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) advances, to reduce reinvestment risk. Short-term borrowings allow us to receive cash to reinvest in longer-duration assets, while paying back the short-term debt with cash flows generated by the fixed income portfolio. The balance of repurchase agreements as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 was $51 million and $50 million, respectively, which is collateralized with agency residential mortgage backed securities and commercial mortgage backed securities from our investment portfolio. Our subsidiary, RiverSource Life Insurance Company (“RiverSource Life”), is a member of the FHLB of Des Moines, which provides access to collateralized borrowings. We had $150 million of borrowings from the FHLB, which is collateralized with commercial mortgage backed securities, as of both June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017. We believe cash flows from operating activities, available cash balances and our availability of revolver borrowings will be sufficient to fund our operating liquidity needs.Dividends from SubsidiariesAmeriprise Financial is primarily a parent holding company for the operations carried out by our wholly owned subsidiaries. Because of our holding company structure, our ability to meet our cash requirements, including the payment of dividends on our common stock, substantially depends upon the receipt of dividends or return of capital from our subsidiaries, particularly our life insurance subsidiary, RiverSource Life, our face-amount certificate subsidiary, Ameriprise Certificate Company (“ACC”), AMPF Holding Corporation, which is the parent company of our retail introducing broker-dealer subsidiary, Ameriprise Financial Services, Inc. (“AFSI”) and our clearing broker-dealer subsidiary, American Enterprise Investment Services, Inc. (“AEIS”), our Auto and Home insurance subsidiary, IDS Property Casualty Insurance Company (“IDS Property Casualty”), doing business as Ameriprise Auto & Home Insurance, our transfer agent subsidiary, Columbia Management Investment Services Corp., our investment advisory company, Columbia Management Investment Advisers, LLC, and Ameriprise International Holdings GmbH, which is the parent company of Threadneedle Asset Management Holdings Sàrl. The payment of dividends by many of our subsidiaries is restricted and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to regulatory capital requirements.85AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. Actual capital and regulatory capital requirements for our wholly owned subsidiaries subject to regulatory capital requirements were as follows: Actual Capital Regulatory Capital RequirementsJune 30, 2018 December 31, 2017June 30, 2018 December 31, 2017(in millions)RiverSource Life (1)(2)$2,930 $2,451 N/A $562RiverSource Life of NY (1)(2)247 269 N/A 36IDS Property Casualty (1)(3)775 781 $227 214Ameriprise Insurance Company (1)(3)49 48 3 3ACC(4)(5)392 365 370 343Threadneedle Asset Management Holdings Sàrl (6)525 426 179 170Ameriprise National Trust Bank (7)23 22 10 10AFSI (3)(4)152 63 # #Ameriprise Captive Insurance Company (3)53 51 12 8Ameriprise Trust Company (3)32 31 28 27AEIS (3)(4)152 125 23 22RiverSource Distributors, Inc.

The regulatory capital requirements at June 30, 2018 represent calculations at December 31, 2017 of the rule based requirements, as specified by FCA regulations.(7) Ameriprise National Trust Bank is required to maintain capital in compliance with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency regulations and policies.In addition to the particular regulations restricting dividend payments and establishing subsidiary capitalization requirements, we take into account the overall health of the business, capital levels and risk management considerations in determining a dividend strategy for payments to our parent holding company from our subsidiaries, and in deciding to use cash to make capital contributions to our subsidiaries.During the six months ended June 30, 2018, the parent holding company received cash dividends or a return of capital from its subsidiaries of $956 million (including $400 million from RiverSource Life) and contributed cash to its subsidiaries of $3 million. During the six months ended June 30, 2017, the parent holding company received cash dividends or a return of capital from its subsidiaries of $908 million (including $500 million from RiverSource Life) and contributed cash to its subsidiaries of $38 million.In 2009, RiverSource established an agreement to protect its exposure to Genworth Life Insurance Company (“GLIC”) for its reinsured LTC. In 2016, substantial enhancements to this reinsurance protection agreement were finalized. The terms of these confidential provisions within the agreement have been shared, in the normal course of regular reviews, with our domiciliary regulator and rating agencies. Management believes that this agreement and offsetting non LTC legacy arrangements with Genworth will enable RiverSource to recover on all net exposure in the event of an insolvency of GLIC.86AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. Dividends Paid to Shareholders and Share RepurchasesWe paid regular quarterly dividends to our shareholders totaling $257 million and $250 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. On July 24, 2018, we announced a quarterly dividend of $0.90 per common share. The dividend will be paid on August 17, 2018 to our shareholders of record at the close of business on August 6, 2018.In April 2017, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase up to $2.5 billion of our common stock through June 30, 2019. As of June 30, 2018, we had $1.3 billion remaining under this share repurchase authorization. We intend to fund share repurchases through existing working capital, future earnings and other customary financing methods. The share repurchase program does not require the purchase of any minimum number of shares, and depending on market conditions and other factors, these purchases may be commenced or suspended at any time without prior notice. Acquisitions under the share repurchase program may be made in the open market, through privately negotiated transactions or block trades or other means. During the six months ended June 30, 2018, we repurchased a total of 5.3 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $149.91 per share.Cash FlowsCash flows of CIEs and restricted and segregated cash are reflected in our cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities, investing activities and financing activities. Cash held by CIEs is not available for general use by Ameriprise Financial, nor is Ameriprise Financial cash available for general use by its CIEs. Cash segregated under federal and other regulations is held for the exclusive benefit of our brokerage customers and is not available for general use by Ameriprise Financial.Operating ActivitiesNet cash provided by operating activities decreased by $175 million to $561 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 compared to $736 million for the prior year period primarily due to a $259 million decrease in cash from changes in brokerage deposits and higher net cash outflows related to derivatives, partially offset by a $122 million decrease in income taxes paid and a $217 million increase in cash from changes in other investments, net driven by proceeds from sales of certificates of deposit.Investing ActivitiesOur investing activities primarily relate to our Available-for-Sale investment portfolio. Further, this activity is significantly affected by the net flows of our investment certificate, fixed annuity and universal life products reflected in financing activities.Net cash provided by investing activities decreased $11 million to $216 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 compared to $227 million for the prior year period primarily due to a $1.4 billion increase in cash used for purchases of Available-for-Sale securities, partially offset by a $564 million increase in proceeds from maturities, sinking fund payments and calls of Available-for-Sale securities, a $125 million increase in proceeds from sales of Available-for-Sale securities and a $611 million decrease in purchases of investments by CIEs.Financing ActivitiesNet cash used in financing activities increased $281 million to $1.1 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2018 compared to $866 million for the prior year period primarily due to $494 million increase in repayments of debt by CIEs, partially offset by a $222 million increase in net cash inflows related to investment certificates.Contractual CommitmentsThere have been no material changes to our contractual obligations disclosed in our 2017 10-K. Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe provide asset management services to investment entities which are considered to be VIEs, such as CLOs, hedge funds, property funds and other private funds, which are sponsored by us. We consolidate certain CLOs. We have determined that consolidation is not required for hedge funds, property funds and other private funds, which are sponsored by us. Our maximum exposure to loss with respect to our investment in these non-consolidated entities is limited to our carrying value.
