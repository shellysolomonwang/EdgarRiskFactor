Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2013 10-K and other factors as discussed herein.Equity price, credit market and interest rate fluctuations can have a significant impact on our results of operations, primarily due to the effects they have on the asset management and other asset-based fees we earn, the “spread” income generated on our fixed annuities, fixed insurance, deposit products and the fixed portion of variable annuities and variable insurance contracts, the value of deferred acquisition costs (“DAC”) and deferred sales inducement costs (“DSIC”) assets, the values of liabilities for guaranteed benefits associated with our variable annuities and the values of derivatives held to hedge these benefits.Earnings, as well as operating earnings, will continue to be negatively impacted by the ongoing low interest rate environment. In addition to continuing spread compression in our interest sensitive product lines, a sustained low interest rate environment may result in increases to our reserves and changes in various rate assumptions we use to amortize DAC and DSIC, which may negatively impact our operating earnings. For additional discussion on our interest rate risk, see Item 3. “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.”In the third quarter of the year, we conduct our annual review of life insurance and annuity valuation assumptions relative to current experience and management expectations. To the extent that expectations change as a result of this review, we update valuation assumptions and the impact is reflected as part of our annual review of life insurance and annuity valuation assumptions and modeling changes (“unlocking”). The unlocking impact in the third quarter of 2014 primarily reflected the difference between our previously assumed interest rates versus the continued low interest rate environment, partially offset by a benefit from updating our variable annuity living benefit withdrawal utilization assumption. The unlocking impact in the third quarter of 2013 primarily reflected the impact of assumed interest rates and changes in assumed policyholder behavior. See our Consolidated and Segment Results of Operations sections below for the pretax impacts on our revenues and expenses attributable to unlocking and additional discussion of the drivers of the unlocking impact.We consolidate certain collateralized debt obligations (“CDOs”) and other investment products (collectively, “investment entities”) for which we provide asset management services and sponsor for the investment of client assets in the normal course of business. These entities are defined as consolidated investment entities (“CIEs”). While the consolidation of the CIEs impacts our balance sheet and income statement, our exposure to these entities is unchanged and there is no impact to the underlying business results. For further information on CIEs, see Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Changes in the valuation of the CIE assets and liabilities impact pretax income. The net income (loss) of the CIEs is reflected in net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests. The results of operations of the CIEs are reflected in the Corporate & Other segment. On a consolidated basis, the management fees we 56AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. earn for the services we provide to the CIEs and the related general and administrative expenses are eliminated and the changes in the assets and liabilities related to the CIEs, primarily debt and underlying syndicated loans, are reflected in net investment income. We continue to include the fees in the management and financial advice fees line within our Asset Management segment.While our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), management believes that operating measures, which exclude net realized gains or losses; the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits, net of hedges and the related DSIC and DAC amortization; the market impact on indexed universal life benefits, net of hedges and the related DAC amortization, unearned revenue amortization and the reinsurance accrual; restructuring charges; income (loss) from discontinued operations; and the impact of consolidating CIEs, best reflect the underlying performance of our core operations and facilitate a more meaningful trend analysis. Management uses certain of these non-GAAP measures to evaluate our financial performance on a basis comparable to that used by some securities analysts and investors. Also, certain of these non-GAAP measures are taken into consideration, to varying degrees, for purposes of business planning and analysis and for certain compensation-related matters. Throughout our Management’s Discussion and Analysis, these non-GAAP measures are referred to as operating measures.It is management’s priority to increase shareholder value over a multi-year horizon by achieving our on-average, over-time financial targets.Our financial targets are:•Operating total net revenue growth of 6% to 8%,•Operating earnings per diluted share growth of 12% to 15%, and•Operating return on equity excluding accumulated other comprehensive income of 19% to 23%.The following tables reconcile our GAAP measures to operating measures: Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2014 2013 2014 2013 (in millions)Total net revenues$3,111 $2,813 $9,179 $8,253Less: Revenue attributable to CIEs206 114 543 208Less: Net realized gains4 6 10 7Less: Market impact on indexed universal life benefits2 (2) — (3)Operating total net revenues$2,899 $2,695 $8,626 $8,041     Per Diluted Share Three Months Ended September 30, Three Months Ended September 30, 2014 2013 2014 2013 (in millions, except per share amounts)Net income$565 $449    Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests145 67    Net income attributable to Ameriprise Financial420 382 $2.17 $1.86Less: Income from discontinued operations, net of tax— 1 — —Net income from continuing operations attributable to Ameriprise Financial420 381 2.17 1.86Add: Market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits, net of tax (1)(5) 13 (0.03) 0.06Add: Market impact on indexed universal life benefits, net of tax (1)(5) 2 (0.03) 0.01Less: Net realized gains, net of tax (1)3 4 0.01 0.02Operating earnings$407 $392 $2.10 $1.91        Weighted average common shares outstanding:       Basic190.3 201.3    Diluted193.7 205.1    (1) Calculated using the statutory tax rate of 35%.57AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC.

Critical Accounting PoliciesThe accounting and reporting policies that we use affect our Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of our accounting and reporting policies are critical to an understanding of our consolidated results of operations and financial condition. In some cases, the application of these policies can be significantly affected by the estimates, judgments and assumptions made by management during the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements. These accounting policies are discussed in detail in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis — Critical Accounting Policies” in our 2013 10-K.Recent Accounting PronouncementsFor information regarding recent accounting pronouncements and their expected impact on our future consolidated results of operations and financial condition, see Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Assets Under Management and AdministrationAssets under management (“AUM”) include external client assets for which we provide investment management services, such as the assets of the Columbia funds and Threadneedle funds, assets of institutional clients and assets of clients in our advisor platform held in wrap accounts as well as assets managed by sub-advisers selected by us. AUM also includes certain assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets for which we provide investment management services and recognize management fees in our Asset Management segment, such as the assets of the general account and the variable product funds held in the separate accounts of our life insurance subsidiaries and client assets of CIEs. These assets do not include assets under advisement, for which we provide model portfolios but do not have full discretionary investment authority. Corporate & Other AUM primarily includes former bank assets that are managed within our Corporate & Other segment.Assets under administration (“AUA”) include assets for which we provide administrative services such as client assets invested in other companies’ products that we offer outside of our wrap accounts. These assets include those held in clients’ brokerage accounts. We generally record revenues received from administered assets as distribution fees. We do not exercise management discretion over these assets and do not earn a management fee. These assets are not reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. AUA also includes certain assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets for which we do not provide investment management services and do not recognize management fees, such as investments in non-affiliated funds held in the separate accounts of our life insurance subsidiaries. These assets do not include assets under advisement, for which we provide model portfolios but do not have full discretionary investment authority.The following table presents detail regarding our AUM and AUA: September 30,   2014 2013 ChangeAssets Under Management and Administration(in billions)  Advice & Wealth Management AUM$169.8 $144.5 $25.3 18 %Asset Management AUM504.8 479.3 25.5 5Corporate & Other AUM0.9 1.0 (0.1) (10)Eliminations(21.7) (19.7) (2.0) (10)Total Assets Under Management653.8 605.1 48.7 8Total Assets Under Administration143.0 129.8 13.2 10Total AUM and AUA$796.8 $734.9 $61.9 8 %Total AUM increased $48.7 billion, or 8%, to $653.8 billion as of September 30, 2014 compared to $605.1 billion as of September 30, 2013 due to a $25.3 billion increase in Advice & Wealth Management AUM driven by wrap account net inflows and market appreciation and a $25.5 billion increase in Asset Management AUM driven by market appreciation, partially offset by net outflows.

Consolidated Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2014 and 2013 The following table presents our consolidated results of operations: Three Months Ended September 30,   2014 2013 Change (in millions)  Revenues       Management and financial advice fees$1,483 $1,318 $165 13 %Distribution fees464 441 23 5Net investment income428 491 (63) (13)Premiums351 324 27 8Other revenues392 247 145 59Total revenues3,118 2,821 297 11Banking and deposit interest expense7 8 (1) (13)Total net revenues3,111 2,813 298 11Expenses       Distribution expenses813 731 82 11Interest credited to fixed accounts168 204 (36) (18)Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses458 492 (34) (7)Amortization of deferred acquisition costs116 (14) 130 NMInterest and debt expense79 68 11 16General and administrative expense757 730 27 4Total expenses2,391 2,211 180 8Income from continuing operations before income tax provision720 602 118 20Income tax provision155 154 1 1Income from continuing operations565 448 117 26Income from discontinued operations, net of tax— 1 (1) NMNet income565 449 116 26Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests145 67 78 NMNet income attributable to Ameriprise Financial$420 $382 $38 10 %NM Not Meaningful.OverallIncome from continuing operations before income tax provision increased $118 million, or 20%, to $720 million for the three months ended September 30, 2014 compared to $602 million for the prior year period primarily reflecting the impact of market appreciation, wrap account net inflows, a $78 million increase in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits (net of hedges and the related DSIC and DAC amortization), partially offset by a $109 million decrease from unlocking. The market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits (net of hedges and the related DSIC and DAC amortization) was a benefit of $9 million for the third quarter of 2014, compared to an expense of $21 million for the prior year period, which included a $17 million benefit associated with unlocking. The impact on DAC and DSIC from actual versus expected market performance based on our view of bond and equity market performance was an expense of $6 million for the third quarter of 2014 compared to a benefit of $13 million for the prior year period as a result of less favorable equity market returns and bond fund returns compared to the prior year period.60AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. The following table presents the total pretax impacts on our revenues and expenses attributable to unlocking for the three months ended September 30:Pretax Increase (Decrease) 2014 2013  (in millions)Other revenues $(29) $(18)     Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses 6 (5)Amortization of DAC 8 (79)Total expenses 14 (84)Total (1) $(43) $66(1) Includes a $17 million net benefit related to the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits for the three months ended September 30, 2013.Net RevenuesNet revenues increased $298 million, or 11%, to $3.1 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2014 compared to $2.8 billion for the prior year period primarily due to higher management and financial advice fees and other revenues.Management and financial advice fees increased $165 million, or 13%, to $1.5 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2014 compared to $1.3 billion for the prior year period primarily due to higher asset-based fees driven by an increase in average AUM. Average AUM increased $70.7 billion, or 12%, compared to the prior year period primarily due to market appreciation and wrap account net inflows, partially offset by asset management net outflows. See our discussion on the changes in AUM in our segment results of operations section below.Distribution fees increased $23 million, or 5%, to $464 million for the three months ended September 30, 2014 compared to $441 million for the prior year period primarily due to higher client assets.Net investment income decreased $63 million, or 13%, to $428 million for the three months ended September 30, 2014 compared to $491 million for the prior year period primarily due to a $25 million decrease in investment income on fixed maturities driven by low interest rates and a $40 million decrease in net investment income of CIEs.Premiums increased $27 million, or 8%, to $351 million for the three months ended September 30, 2014 compared to $324 million for the prior year period primarily due to growth in auto and home policy counts of 11% compared to the prior year period.Other revenues increased $145 million, or 59%, to $392 million for the three months ended September 30, 2014 compared to $247 million for the prior year period due to a $134 million increase in other revenues of CIEs and higher fees from variable annuity guarantee sales in the prior year where the fees start on the first anniversary date, and higher average fee rates, partially offset by the impact of unlocking. Other revenues for the third quarter of 2014 included a $29 million negative impact from unlocking compared to an $18 million negative impact in the prior year period. The primary driver of the unlocking impact to other revenues in both periods was lower projected gains on reinsurance contracts resulting from favorable mortality experience.ExpensesTotal expenses increased $180 million, or 8%, to $2.4 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2014 compared to $2.2 billion for the prior year period primarily due to increases in distribution expenses and amortization of DAC.Distribution expenses increased $82 million, or 11%, to $813 million for the three months ended September 30, 2014 compared to $731 million for the prior year period driven by higher compensation due to growth in assets under management. See our discussion on the changes in AUM in our segment results of operations section below.Interest credited to fixed accounts decreased $36 million, or 18%, to $168 million for the three months ended September 30, 2014 compared to $204 million for the prior year period driven by lower average fixed annuity account balances and a lower average crediting rate on interest sensitive fixed annuities. Average fixed annuity account balances decreased $1.0 billion, or 7%, to $12.5 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2014 compared to the prior year period due to net outflows reflecting elevated surrenders on products sold through third parties where rates have reset. The average fixed annuity crediting rate excluding capitalized interest decreased to 3.0% for the three months ended September 30, 2014 compared to 3.6% for the prior year period reflecting the re-pricing of the five-year guarantee block. See additional discussion on the re-pricing in the Annuities segment.Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses decreased $34 million, or 7%, to $458 million for the three months ended September 30, 2014 compared to $492 million for the prior year period primarily reflecting the following items:•The three months ended September 30, 2014 included a $6 million expense from unlocking, which included nil related to the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits. The prior year period included a $5 million benefit from unlocking, which included a $22 million benefit related to the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits. The market impact on 61AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. variable annuity guaranteed benefits is discussed below. The unlocking impact for the three months ended September 30, 2014 reflected the difference between our previously assumed interest rates versus the continued low interest rate environment, partially offset by a benefit from updating our variable annuity living benefit withdrawal utilization assumption. The unlocking impact for the prior year period reflected the impact of assumed interest rates and changes in assumed policyholder behavior, partially offset by the impact of variable annuity model changes. •A $15 million increase in expense related to our auto and home business driven by higher claim and claim adjustment expense reflecting the impact of growth in exposures due to an 11% increase in policies in force. •A $5 million increase in expense related to higher reserve funding driven by the impact of higher fees from variable annuity guarantee sales in the prior year where the fees start on the first anniversary date.•An increase in expense compared to the prior year period due to the impact on DSIC from actual versus expected market performance based on our view of bond and equity market performance. This impact was an expense of $1 million for the third quarter of 2014 compared to a benefit of $3 million for the prior year period as a result of less favorable equity market returns and bond fund returns compared to the prior year period.•A $98 million decrease in expense compared to the prior year period from the unhedged nonperformance credit spread risk adjustment on variable annuity guaranteed benefits.•A $57 million increase in expense from other market impacts on variable annuity guaranteed benefits, net of hedges in place to offset those risks and the related DSIC amortization. The $57 million increase was the result of an unfavorable $679 million change in the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits reserves, a favorable $625 million change in the market impact on derivatives hedging the variable annuity guaranteed benefits and an unfavorable $3 million DSIC offset. The main market drivers contributing to these changes are summarized below:•Interest rates were down in 2014 and up in 2013 resulting in an unfavorable change in the variable annuity guaranteed living benefits liability, partially offset by a favorable change in the related hedge assets. •Equity market and volatility impacts on the variable annuity guaranteed living benefits liability resulted in an increase in expense in 2014 compared to a decrease in expense in 2013. This unfavorable change was partially offset by a favorable change in 2014 compared to 2013 from equity market and volatility impacts on the related hedge assets. •Other unhedged items, including the difference between the assumed and actual underlying separate account investment performance, fixed income credit exposures, transaction costs and various behavioral items, were a net favorable impact compared to the prior year period.Amortization of DAC increased $130 million to a $116 million expense for the three months ended September 30, 2014 compared to a $14 million benefit for the prior year period primarily reflecting the following items: •Amortization of DAC for the third quarter of 2014 included an $8 million expense from unlocking, primarily driven by the difference between our previously assumed interest rates versus the continued low interest rate environment, partially offset by favorable persistency and mortality experience and a benefit from updating our variable annuity living benefit withdrawal utilization assumption. Amortization of DAC for the prior year period included a $79 million benefit from unlocking, which included a $5 million expense related to the DAC offset to the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits, primarily driven by the impact of assumed interest rates and changes in assumed policyholder behavior. •The impact on DAC from actual versus expected market performance based on our view of bond and equity performance was an expense of $5 million for the third quarter of 2014 compared to a benefit of $10 million for the prior year period as a result of less favorable equity market returns and bond fund returns compared to the prior year period. •The DAC offset to the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits (net of hedges and the related DSIC amortization) was an expense of $7 million for the third quarter of 2014 compared to a benefit of $4 million for the prior year period.Interest and debt expense increased $11 million, or 16%, to $79 million for the three months ended September 30, 2014 compared to $68 million for the prior year period primarily due to a $12 million increase in interest and debt expense of CIEs.General and administrative expenses increased $27 million, or 4%, to $757 million for the three months ended September 30, 2014 compared to $730 million for the prior year period primarily due to higher year over year compensation and investments in the business.Income TaxesOur effective tax rate on income from continuing operations including income attributable to noncontrolling interests was 21.6% for the three months ended September 30, 2014 compared to 25.5% for the prior year period. Our effective tax rate on income from continuing operations excluding income attributable to noncontrolling interests was 27.0% for the three months ended September 30, 2014 compared to 28.7% for the prior year period. The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2014 was lower than the statutory rate as a result of tax preferred items including the dividends received deduction and low income housing tax credits. 62AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. In July 2014, the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) issued a Large Business & International Directive (“Directive”) with respect to the hedging of variable annuity guaranteed minimum benefits. The Directive provides an elective safe harbor method of tax accounting for hedge gains and losses related to variable annuity guaranteed benefits. On October 8, 2014, we filed with the IRS an application for change in accounting method, to conform, in part, to the Directive. If accepted by the IRS, the change in accounting method could have a material impact on our current and deferred income tax balances.Results of Operations by Segment for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2014 and 2013 Operating earnings is the measure of segment profit or loss management uses to evaluate segment performance. Operating earnings should not be viewed as a substitute for GAAP income from continuing operations before income tax provision. We believe the presentation of segment operating earnings as we measure it for management purposes enhances the understanding of our business by reflecting the underlying performance of our core operations and facilitating a more meaningful trend analysis. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the presentation of segment results and our definition of operating earnings.The following table presents summary financial information by segment: Three Months Ended September 30, 2014 2013 (in millions)Advice & Wealth Management   Net revenues$1,210 $1,074Expenses1,005 922Operating earnings$205 $152Asset Management   Net revenues$839 $777Expenses631 605Operating earnings$208 $172Annuities   Net revenues$655 $649Expenses527 444Operating earnings$128 $205Protection   Net revenues$553 $535Expenses487 467Operating earnings$66 $68Corporate & Other   Net revenues$(1) $1Expenses52 46Operating loss$(53) $(45)The following table presents the segment pretax operating impacts on our revenues and expenses attributable to unlocking:  Three Months Ended September 30,Segment Pretax Operating Increase (Decrease) 2014 2013 Annuities Protection Annuities Protection  (in millions)Other revenues $— $(29) $— $(18)         Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses 5 1 21 (4)Amortization of DAC 17 (9) (81) (3)Total expenses 22 (8) (60) (7)Total $(22) $(21) $60 $(11)63AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. Advice & Wealth ManagementOur Advice & Wealth Management segment provides financial planning and advice, as well as full-service brokerage services, primarily to retail clients through our advisors. These services are centered on long-term, personal relationships between our advisors and our clients and focus on helping clients confidently achieve their financial goals. Our advisors provide a distinctive approach to financial planning and have access to a broad selection of both affiliated and non-affiliated products to help clients meet their financial needs. A significant portion of revenues in this segment is fee-based, driven by the level of client assets, which is impacted by both market movements and net asset flows. We also earn net investment income on invested assets primarily from certificate products. This segment earns revenues (distribution fees) for distributing non-affiliated products and intersegment revenues (distribution fees) for distributing our affiliated products and services to our retail clients. Intersegment expenses for this segment include expenses for investment management services provided by the Asset Management segment.In addition to purchases of affiliated and non-affiliated mutual funds and other securities on a stand-alone basis, clients may purchase mutual funds, among other securities, in connection with investment advisory fee-based “wrap account” programs or services, and pay fees based on a percentage of their assets.The following table presents the changes in wrap account assets and average balances for the three months ended September 30: 2014 2013 (in billions)Beginning balance$167.8 $135.9Net flows (1)3.8 3.0Market appreciation (depreciation) and other (1)(2.4) 5.2Ending balance$169.2 $144.1    Average balance (2)$168.7 $140.0(1) Beginning April 1, 2014, net flows reflect all additions and withdrawals to and from the Ameriprise Strategic Portfolio Service (“SPS”) wrap account program. For all periods presented prior to April 1, 2014, additions and withdrawals to and from certain non-billable investments of this program were reflected in the Market appreciation (depreciation) and other line and purchases and sales of billable investments were reported in the Net flows line. Net flows for the SPS program are now reported on a consistent basis with our other wrap account programs.(2) Average ending balances are calculated using an average of the prior period’s ending balance and all months in the current period.Wrap account assets increased $1.4 billion, or 1%, during the three months ended September 30, 2014 due to net inflows of $3.8 billion offset by market depreciation and other of $2.4 billion. Average wrap account assets increased $28.7 billion, or 21%, compared to the prior year period due to net inflows and market appreciation from the prior year period.The following table presents the changes in wrap account assets for the twelve months ended September 30: 2014 2013 (in billions)Beginning balance$144.1 $120.6Net flows (1)13.9 12.3Market appreciation and other (1)11.2 11.2Ending balance$169.2 $144.1(1) See Note 1 in the table above.Wrap account assets increased $25.1 billion, or 17%, from the prior year period reflecting net inflows and market appreciation.64AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC.

Columbia Management primarily provides products and services in the U.S. and Threadneedle primarily provides products and services internationally. We provide clients with U.S. domestic individual products through unaffiliated third party financial institutions and through our Advice & Wealth Management segment, and we provide institutional products and services through our institutional sales force. International retail products are primarily distributed through third-party financial institutions and unaffiliated financial advisors. Individual products include U.S. mutual funds and non-U.S. equivalents, exchange-traded funds and variable product funds underlying insurance and annuity separate accounts. Institutional asset management services are designed to meet specific client objectives and may involve a range of products, including those that focus on traditional asset classes, separately managed accounts, individually managed accounts, collateralized loan obligations, hedge funds, collective funds and property funds. Collateralized loan obligations, hedge funds and certain private funds are often classified as alternative assets. Revenues in this segment are primarily earned as fees based on managed asset balances, which are impacted by market movements, net asset flows, asset allocation and product mix. We may also earn performance fees from certain accounts where investment performance meets or exceeds certain pre-identified targets. Our Asset Management segment also provides intercompany asset management services for Ameriprise Financial subsidiaries. The fees for such services are reflected 65AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. within the Asset Management segment results through intersegment transfer pricing. Intersegment expenses for this segment include distribution expenses for services provided by our Advice & Wealth Management, Annuities and Protection segments.From time to time, fee waivers have been provided to the Columbia Money Market Funds (the “Funds”) by Columbia Management and certain other subsidiaries performing services for the Funds for the purpose of reducing the expenses charged to a Fund in a given period to maintain or improve a Fund’s net yield in that period. Our subsidiaries may enter into contractual arrangements with the Funds identifying the specific fees to be waived and/or expenses to be reimbursed, as well as the time period for which such waivers will apply. In aggregate, we voluntarily waived fees of $3 million for both the three months ended September 30, 2014 and 2013.The following tables present the mutual fund performance of our retail Columbia and Threadneedle funds as of September 30:ColumbiaMutual Fund Rankings in top 2 Lipper Quartiles    2014 2013Domestic EquityEqual weighted 1 year 66% 55%   3 year 73% 63%   5 year 54% 61% Asset weighted 1 year 62% 35%   3 year 68% 76%   5 year 60% 73%        International EquityEqual weighted 1 year 73% 47%   3 year 59% 41%   5 year 60% 56% Asset weighted 1 year 87% 22%   3 year 40% 26%   5 year 38% 81%        Taxable Fixed IncomeEqual weighted 1 year 44% 61%   3 year 56% 71%   5 year 59% 50% Asset weighted 1 year 66% 72%   3 year 69% 83%   5 year 70% 62%        Tax Exempt Fixed IncomeEqual weighted 1 year 94% 94%   3 year 94% 94%   5 year 100% 100% Asset weighted 1 year 84% 98%   3 year 84% 98%   5 year 100% 100%        Asset Allocation FundsEqual weighted 1 year 58% 62%   3 year 64% 70%   5 year 89% 80% Asset weighted 1 year 65% 65%   3 year 75% 85%   5 year 97% 92%        Number of funds with 4 or 5 Morningstar star ratings  Overall 54 51   3 year 48 45   5 year 46 40        Percent of funds with 4 or 5 Morningstar star ratings  Overall 51% 52%   3 year 46% 46%   5 year 47% 43%        Percent of assets with 4 or 5 Morningstar star ratings  Overall 56% 54%   3 year 38% 39%   5 year 52% 43%66AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. Mutual fund performance rankings are based on the performance of Class Z fund shares for Columbia branded mutual funds. Only funds with Class Z shares are included. In instances where a fund’s Class Z shares do not have a full five year track record, performance for an older share class of the same fund, typically Class A shares, is utilized for the period before Class Z shares were launched. No adjustments to the historical track records are made to account for differences in fund expenses between share classes of a fund.Equal Weighted Rankings in Top 2 Quartiles: Counts the number of funds with above median ranking divided by the total number of funds.

Total segment AUM net outflows were $4.1 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2014. Management expects, consistent with prior patterns of outflows, that outflows of primarily low margin assets directly or indirectly affiliated with Threadneedle and Columbia former parent companies will continue for the foreseeable future. The overall impact to segment results is difficult to quantify due to uncertain timing, volume and mix of the outflows. Columbia managed assets decreased $5.9 billion, or 2%, during the three months ended September 30, 2014 primarily due to net outflows and market depreciation. Columbia retail funds decreased $6.8 billion, or 3%, during the three months ended September 30, 2014 due to market depreciation, net outflows and distributions. Columbia retail net outflows of $2.5 billion during the third quarter of 2014 included $1.8 billion of outflows in the defined contribution/investment only channel, $0.3 billion of outflows from a former parent affiliated distribution relationship, $0.4 billion of outflows in the Registered Investment Advisor (“RIA”) channel and $0.2 70AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. billion of outflows of a third party sub-advisor. Columbia institutional AUM increased $0.4 billion, or 1%, during the three months ended September 30, 2014 due to market appreciation and net inflows of $0.3 billion primarily reflecting third party institutional inflows offset by outflows from former parent affiliated distribution and former parent influenced mandates. Threadneedle managed assets decreased $7.8 billion, or 5%, during the three months ended September 30, 2014 due to net outflows and a negative impact of foreign currency translation. Threadneedle retail funds decreased $3.8 billion, or 7%, during the three months ended September 30, 2014 primarily due to a negative impact of foreign currency translation and net outflows. Threadneedle retail net outflows were $1.0 billion. Threadneedle institutional AUM decreased $3.9 billion, or 4%, during the three months ended September 30, 2014 primarily due to net outflows and a negative impact of foreign currency translation. Threadneedle institutional net outflows of $0.9 billion during the third quarter of 2014 were primarily from legacy insurance assets.

Net RevenuesNet revenues, which exclude net realized gains or losses, increased $62 million, or 8%, to $839 million for the three months ended September 30, 2014 compared to $777 million for the prior year period driven by an increase in management and financial advice fees.Management and financial advice fees increased $51 million, or 8%, to $706 million for the three months ended September 30, 2014 compared to $655 million for the prior year period primarily due to an increase in assets under management. Average assets under management increased 9% compared to the prior year period driven by equity market appreciation, partially offset by net outflows. See our discussion above on the changes in assets under management.ExpensesTotal expenses increased $26 million, or 4%, to $631 million for the three months ended September 30, 2014 compared to $605 million for the prior year period primarily due to an increase in distribution expenses and an increase in general and administrative expenses. Distribution expenses increased $10 million, or 4%, to $288 million for the three months ended September 30, 2014 compared to $278 million for the prior year period primarily due to equity market appreciation, partially offset by net outflows. General and administrative expense increased $17 million, or 5%, to $333 million for the three months ended September 30, 2014 compared to $316 million for the prior year period due to the negative impacts of foreign exchange rates during the quarter and investments in the business, partially offset by lower expenses as a result of the cumulative impact of net outflows.71AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. AnnuitiesOur Annuities segment provides variable and fixed annuity products of RiverSource Life companies to individual clients. We provide our variable annuity products through our advisors, and our fixed annuity products are distributed through both affiliated and unaffiliated advisors and financial institutions. Revenues from our variable annuity products are primarily earned as fees based on underlying account balances, which are impacted by both market movements and net asset flows. Revenues from our fixed annuity products are primarily earned as net investment income on assets supporting fixed account balances, with profitability significantly impacted by the spread between net investment income earned and interest credited on the fixed account balances. We also earn net investment income on owned assets supporting reserves for immediate annuities and for certain guaranteed benefits offered with variable annuities and on capital supporting the business. Intersegment revenues for this segment reflect fees paid by our Asset Management segment for marketing support and other services provided in connection with the availability of variable insurance trust funds (“VIT Funds”) under the variable annuity contracts. Intersegment expenses for this segment include distribution expenses for services provided by our Advice & Wealth Management segment, as well as expenses for investment management services provided by our Asset Management segment.The following table presents the results of operations of our Annuities segment on an operating basis: Three Months Ended September 30,     2014 2013 Change (in millions)  Revenues       Management and financial advice fees$191 $179 $12 7 %Distribution fees91 86 5 6Net investment income235 260 (25) (10)Premiums26 27 (1) (4)Other revenues112 97 15 15Total revenues655 649 6 1Banking and deposit interest expense— — — —Total net revenues655 649 6 1Expenses       Distribution expenses110 104 6 6Interest credited to fixed accounts136 164 (28) (17)Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses136 150 (14) (9)Amortization of deferred acquisition costs78 (41) 119 NMInterest and debt expense9 10 (1) (10)General and administrative expense58 57 1 2Total expenses527 444 83 19Operating earnings$128 $205 $(77) (38)%NM Not Meaningful.Our Annuities segment pretax operating income, which excludes net realized gains or losses and the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits (net of hedges and the related DSIC and DAC amortization), decreased $77 million, or 38%, to $128 million for the three months ended September 30, 2014 compared to $205 million for the prior year period primarily due to the impact of unlocking partially offset by market appreciation. The impact of unlocking was a decrease to pretax operating income of $22 million for the third quarter of 2014 compared to an increase of $60 million for the prior year period. In addition, the impact on DAC and DSIC from actual versus expected market performance based on our view of bond and equity performance was an expense of $6 million for the third quarter of 2014 compared to an benefit of $13 million for the prior year period as a result of less favorable equity market returns and bond fund returns compared to the prior year period.RiverSource variable annuity account balances increased 5% to $76.1 billion at September 30, 2014 compared to the prior year period due to market appreciation, partially offset by net outflows of $1.6 billion. RiverSource fixed annuity account balances declined 8% to $12.4 billion at September 30, 2014 compared to the prior year period reflecting elevated surrenders on products sold through third parties where crediting rates have been reset. This decline was offset by the change in crediting rates, which decreased the level of spread compression in the third quarter of 2014. Approximately 98% of the five-year guarantee block totaling $4.1 billion has been re-priced as of September 30, 2014.72AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. Net RevenuesNet revenues, which exclude net realized gains or losses, increased $6 million, or 1%, to $655 million for the three months ended September 30, 2014 compared to $649 million for the prior year period primarily due to higher management and financial advice fees and other revenues, partially offset by a decrease in net investment income.Management and financial advice fees increased $12 million, or 7%, to $191 million for the three months ended September 30, 2014 compared to $179 million for the prior year period due to higher fees on variable annuities driven by higher separate account balances. Average variable annuity account balances increased $5.2 billion, or 8%, compared to the prior year period due to market appreciation, partially offset by net outflows.Distribution fees increased $5 million, or 6%, to $91 million for the three months ended September 30, 2014 compared to $86 million for the prior year period due to higher fees on variable annuities driven by higher separate account balances.Net investment income, which excludes net realized gains or losses, decreased $25 million, or 10%, to $235 million for the three months ended September 30, 2014 compared to $260 million for the prior year period primarily reflecting a decrease of approximately $11 million from lower invested assets due to fixed annuity net outflows and approximately $15 million from lower interest rates.Other revenues increased $15 million, or 15%, to $112 million for the three months ended September 30, 2014 compared to $97 million for the prior year period due to higher fees from variable annuity guarantee sales in the prior year where the fees start on the first anniversary date, as well as higher average fee rates.ExpensesTotal expenses, which exclude the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits (net of hedges and the related DSIC and DAC amortization) increased $83 million, or 19%, to $527 million for the three months ended September 30, 2014 compared to $444 million for the prior year period primarily due to an increase in amortization of DAC, partially offset by a decrease in interest credited to fixed accounts and benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses. Interest credited to fixed accounts decreased $28 million, or 17%, to $136 million for the three months ended September 30, 2014 compared to $164 million for the prior year period driven by lower average fixed annuity account balances and a lower average crediting rate on interest sensitive fixed annuities. Average fixed annuity account balances decreased $1.0 billion, or 7%, to $12.5 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2014 compared to the prior year period due to net outflows reflecting elevated surrenders on products sold through third parties where rates have reset. The average fixed annuity crediting rate excluding capitalized interest decreased to 3.0% for the three months ended September 30, 2014 compared to 3.6% for the prior year period reflecting the re-pricing of the five-year guarantee block. Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses, which exclude the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits (net of hedges and the related DSIC amortization), decreased $14 million, or 9%, to $136 million for the three months ended September 30, 2014 compared to $150 million for the prior year period primarily due to the impact of unlocking partially offset by the impact on DSIC from actual versus expected market performance based on our view of bond and equity market performance and an increase in expense of $5 million related to higher reserve funding driven by the impact of higher fees from variable annuity guarantee sales in the prior year where the fees start on the first anniversary date. Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses for the third quarter of 2014 included a $5 million expense from unlocking primarily reflecting the difference between our previously assumed interest rates versus the continued low interest rate environment, partially offset by a benefit from updating our variable annuity living benefit withdrawal utilization assumption. Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses for the prior year period included a $21 million expense from unlocking primarily reflecting the impact of variable annuity model changes. The impact on DSIC from actual versus expected market performance based on our view of bond and equity performance was an expense of $1 million for the third quarter of 2014 compared to a benefit of $3 million for the prior year period as a result of less favorable equity market returns and bond fund returns compared to the prior year period.Amortization of DAC, which excludes the DAC offset to the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits, increased $119 million to a $78 million expense for the three months ended September 30, 2014 compared to a $41 million benefit for the prior year period primarily reflecting the impact of unlocking and the impact on DAC from actual versus expected market performance based on our view of bond and equity market performance. Amortization of DAC for the third quarter of 2014 included a $17 million expense from unlocking primarily driven by the difference between our previously assumed interest rates versus the continued low interest rate environment, partially offset by favorable persistency and mortality experience and a benefit from updating our variable annuity living benefit withdrawal utilization assumption. Amortization of DAC for the prior year period included an $81 million benefit from unlocking primarily driven by the impact of assumed interest rates and changes in assumed policyholder behavior. The impact on DAC from actual versus expected market performance based on our view of bond and equity performance was an expense of $5 million for the third quarter of 2014 compared to a benefit of $10 million for the prior year period as a result of less favorable equity market returns and bond fund returns compared to the prior year period.73AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. ProtectionOur Protection segment offers a variety of products to address the protection and risk management needs of our retail clients including life, disability income and property-casualty insurance. Life and disability income products are primarily provided through our advisors. Our property-casualty products are sold primarily through affinity relationships. We issue insurance policies through our life insurance and property casualty subsidiaries. The primary sources of revenues for this segment are premiums, fees and charges we receive to assume insurance-related risk. We earn net investment income on owned assets supporting insurance reserves and capital supporting the business. We also receive fees based on the level of assets supporting variable universal life (“VUL”) separate account balances. This segment earns intersegment revenues from fees paid by our Asset Management segment for marketing support and other services provided in connection with the availability of VIT Funds under the VUL contracts. Intersegment expenses for this segment include distribution expenses for services provided by our Advice & Wealth Management segment, as well as expenses for investment management services provided by our Asset Management segment.The following table presents the results of operations of our Protection segment on an operating basis: Three Months Ended September 30,     2014 2013 Change (in millions)  Revenues       Management and financial advice fees$14 $15 $(1) (7)%Distribution fees24 22 2 9Net investment income111 110 1 1Premiums329 301 28 9Other revenues75 87 (12) (14)Total revenues553 535 18 3Banking and deposit interest expense— — — —Total net revenues553 535 18 3Expenses       Distribution expenses14 16 (2) (13)Interest credited to fixed accounts39 40 (1) (3)Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses338 317 21 7Amortization of deferred acquisition costs26 26 — —Interest and debt expense6 6 — —General and administrative expense64 62 2 3Total expenses487 467 20 4Operating earnings$66 $68 $(2) (3)%Our Protection segment pretax operating income, which excludes net realized gains or losses and the market impact on indexed universal life benefits (net of hedges and the related DAC amortization, unearned revenue amortization and the reinsurance accrual), decreased $2 million, or 3%, to $66 million for the three months ended September 30, 2014 compared to $68 million for the prior year period primarily due to the impact of unlocking offset by higher auto and home earnings. Net RevenuesNet revenues, which exclude net realized gains or losses and the unearned revenue amortization and the reinsurance accrual offset to the market impact on indexed universal life benefits, increased $18 million, or 3%, to $553 million for the three months ended September 30, 2014 compared to $535 million for the prior year period due to growth in auto and home premiums partially offset by the impact of unlocking.Premiums increased $28 million, or 9%, to $329 million for the three months ended September 30, 2014 compared to $301 million for the prior year period primarily due to growth in auto and home premiums driven by an 11% increase in auto and home policies in force compared to the prior year period.Other revenues decreased $12 million, or 14%, to $75 million for the three months ended September 30, 2014 compared to $87 million for the prior year period due to a $29 million unfavorable impact from unlocking in the third quarter of 2014 compared to an $18 million unfavorable impact in the prior year period. The primary driver of the unlocking impact to other revenues in both periods was lower projected gains on reinsurance contracts resulting from favorable mortality experience.74AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. ExpensesTotal expenses, which exclude the market impact on indexed universal life benefits (net of hedges and the related DAC amortization), increased $20 million, or 4%, to $487 million for the three months ended September 30, 2014 compared to $467 million for the prior year period primarily due to higher expenses related to our auto and home business and the impact of unlocking.Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses increased $21 million, or 7%, to $338 million for the three months ended September 30, 2014 compared to $317 million for the prior year period due to the impact of unlocking and higher auto and home claim and claim adjustment expense reflecting the impact of growth in exposures due to a 11% increase in policies in force compared to the prior year period. Catastrophe losses were flat for the three months ended September 30, 2014 compared to the prior year period. The impact of unlocking was a $1 million expense in the third quarter of 2014 primarily driven by the difference between our previously assumed interest rates versus the continued low interest rate environment, partially offset by favorable mortality experience. The impact of unlocking was a $4 million benefit in the prior year period primarily driven by favorable mortality experience.Corporate & OtherOur Corporate & Other segment consists of net investment income or loss on corporate level assets, including excess capital held in our subsidiaries and other unallocated equity and other revenues as well as unallocated corporate expenses. The Corporate & Other segment also includes revenues and expenses of CIEs, which are excluded on an operating basis.The following table presents the results of operations of our Corporate & Other segment on an operating basis: Three Months Ended September 30,     2014 2013 Change (in millions)  Revenues       Net investment income (loss)$(3) $(1) $(2) NMOther revenues2 2 — — %Total revenues(1) 1 (2) NMBanking and deposit interest expense— — — —Total net revenues(1) 1 (2) NMExpenses       Distribution expenses1 — 1 —Interest and debt expense3 3 — —General and administrative expense48 43 5 12Total expenses52 46 6 13Operating loss$(53) $(45) $(8) (18)%NM Not Meaningful.Our Corporate & Other segment pretax operating loss excludes net realized gains or losses, the impact of consolidating CIEs and integration/restructuring charges.

The market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits (net of hedges and the related DSIC and DAC amortization) was an expense of $60 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2014, which included a $2 million expense associated with policyholder movement of investments in Portfolio Navigator funds under certain in force variable annuities with living benefit guarantees to the Portfolio Stabilizer funds, compared to an expense of $66 million for the prior year period, which included a $17 million benefit associated with unlocking. The negative impact on earnings from spread compression in our interest sensitive product lines was approximately $28 million pretax for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 compared to the prior year period. 76AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. The following table presents the total pretax impacts on our revenues and expenses attributable to unlocking and model changes for the nine months ended September 30: Pretax Increase (Decrease) 2014 2013  (in millions)Other revenues $(29) $(18)     Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses 6 (5)Amortization of DAC 8 (79)Total expenses 14 (84)Total (1) $(43) $66(1) Includes a $17 million net benefit related to the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits for the nine months ended September 30, 2013.Net RevenuesNet revenues increased $926 million, or 11%, to $9.2 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 compared to $8.3 billion for the prior year period primarily due to higher management and financial advice fees and other revenues.Management and financial advice fees increased $465 million, or 12%, to $4.3 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 compared to $3.9 billion for the prior year period primarily due to higher asset-based fees driven by an increase in average AUM. Average AUM increased $65.5 billion, or 11%, compared to the prior year period primarily due to market appreciation and wrap account net inflows, partially offset by asset management net outflows. See our discussion on the changes in AUM in our segment results of operations section below. Distribution fees increased $87 million, or 7%, to $1.4 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 compared to $1.3 billion for the prior year period due to higher client assets.Net investment income decreased $99 million, or 7%, to $1.3 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 compared to $1.4 billion for the prior year period primarily due to a $80 million decrease in investment income on fixed maturities driven by low interest rates, a $9 million decrease associated with affordable housing partnerships and a $7 million decrease in net investment income of CIE’s.Premiums increased $77 million, or 8%, to $1.0 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 compared to $949 million for the prior year period primarily due to growth in auto and home premiums driven by continued new policy sales growth, primarily from our affinity relationships with Costco and Progressive. Auto and home policies in force increased 11% compared to the prior year period.Other revenues increased $393 million, or 55%, to $1.1 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 compared to $718 million for the prior year period due to a $346 million increase in other revenues of CIEs and higher fees from variable annuity guarantee sales in the prior year where the fees start on the first anniversary date, as well as higher average fee rates, partially offset by the impact of unlocking. Other revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 included a $29 million negative impact from unlocking compared to an $18 million negative impact in the prior year period. The primary driver of the unlocking impact to other revenues in both periods was lower projected gains on reinsurance contracts resulting from favorable mortality experience.ExpensesTotal expenses increased $428 million, or 6%, to $7.2 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 compared to $6.8 billion for the prior year period primarily due to increases in distribution expenses and amortization of DAC.Distribution expenses increased $248 million, or 11%, to $2.4 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 compared to $2.2 billion for the prior year period driven by higher compensation due to growth in assets under management. See our discussion on the changes in AUM in our segment results of operations section below.Interest credited to fixed accounts decreased $71 million, or 12%, to $529 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 compared to $600 million for the prior year period driven by lower average fixed annuity account balances and a lower average crediting rate on interest sensitive fixed annuities. Average fixed annuity account balances decreased $827 million, or 6%, to $12.8 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 compared to the prior year period due to net outflows reflecting elevated surrenders on products sold through third parties where rates have reset. The average fixed annuity crediting rate excluding capitalized interest decreased to 3.1% for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 compared to 3.6% for the prior year period reflecting the re-pricing of the five-year guarantee block. See additional discussion on the re-pricing in the Annuities segment.77AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses increased $23 million, or 2%, to $1.4 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 compared to $1.4 billion for the prior year period primarily reflecting the following items:•The nine months ended September 30, 2014 included a $6 million expense from unlocking, which included nil related to the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits. The prior year period included a $5 million benefit from unlocking, which included a $22 million benefit related to the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits. The market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits is discussed below. The unlocking impact for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 reflected the difference between our previously assumed interest rates versus the continued low interest rate environment, partially offset by a benefit from updating our variable annuity living benefit withdrawal utilization assumption. The unlocking impact for the prior year period reflected the impact of assumed interest rates and changes in assumed policyholder behavior, partially offset by the impact of variable annuity model changes.•A $99 million increase in expense related to our auto and home business driven by higher claim and claim adjustment expense reflecting the impact of growth in exposures due to a 7% increase in gross new policies, an increase in catastrophe losses due to severe weather and a $30 million increase in auto liability reserves in the first quarter of 2014 based upon additional analysis and information regarding continued adverse development of bodily injury claims associated with prior accident years. Catastrophe losses were $56 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 compared to $35 million for the prior year period. •A $21 million increase in expense related to higher reserve funding driven by the impact of higher fees from variable annuity guarantee sales in the prior year where the fees start on the first anniversary date.•A $48 million decrease in expenses from policyholder movement of investments in Portfolio Navigator funds under certain in force variable annuities with living benefit guarantees to the Portfolio Stabilizer funds, which included a $2 million expense related to the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits. See additional discussion in the Annuities segment.•A decrease in expense compared to the prior year period due to an $8 million increase in disability income reserves in the second quarter of 2013 related to prior periods.•A $248 million decrease in expense compared to the prior year period from the unhedged nonperformance credit spread risk adjustment on variable annuity guaranteed benefits.•A $234 million increase in expense from other market impacts on variable annuity guaranteed benefits, net of hedges in place to offset those risks and the related DSIC amortization. The $234 million increase was the result of an unfavorable $1.9 billion change in the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits reserves, a favorable $1.7 billion change in the market impact on derivatives hedging the variable annuity guaranteed benefits and no difference in the DSIC offset. The main market drivers contributing to these changes are summarized below:•Interest rates were down in 2014 and up in 2013 resulting in an unfavorable change in the variable annuity guaranteed living benefits liability, partially offset by a favorable change in the related hedge assets. •Equity market and volatility impacts on the hedge assets resulted in a smaller increase in expense in 2014 compared to 2013. This benefit was partially offset by an unfavorable change in 2014 compared to 2013 from equity market and volatility impacts on the related variable annuity guaranteed living benefits liability.•Other unhedged items, including the difference between the assumed and actual underlying separate account investment performance, fixed income credit exposures, transaction costs and various behavioral items, were a net favorable impact compared to the prior year period.Amortization of DAC increased $128 million, or 84%, to $281 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 compared to $153 million for the prior year period primarily reflecting the following items: •Amortization of DAC for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 included an $8 million expense from unlocking, primarily driven by the difference between our previously assumed interest rates versus the continued low interest rate environment, partially offset by favorable persistency and mortality experience and a benefit from updating our variable annuity living benefit withdrawal utilization assumption. Amortization of DAC for the prior year period included a $79 million benefit from unlocking, which included a $5 million expense related to the DAC offset to the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits, primarily driven by the impact of assumed interest rates and changes in assumed policyholder behavior. •An $8 million expense related to the DAC offset to the benefit from policyholder movement of investments in Portfolio Navigator funds under certain in force variable annuities with living benefit guarantees to the Portfolio Stabilizer funds.•The DAC offset to the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits (net of hedges and the related DSIC amortization) was a benefit of $3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 compared to a benefit of $11 million for the prior year period.Interest and debt expense increased $43 million, or 22%, to $237 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 compared to $194 million for the prior year period primarily due to a $31 million increase in interest and debt expense of CIEs, as well as 78AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. expenses related to the early redemption of our senior notes due 2039 in the second quarter of 2014 and higher average outstanding debt balances.General and administrative expenses increased $57 million, or 3%, to $2.3 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 compared to $2.3 billion for the prior year period primarily due to provisions for regulatory reserves in the second quarter of 2014, higher performance driven compensation, investments in the business and an $8 million increase in general and administrative expenses of CIEs. Income TaxesOur effective tax rate on income from continuing operations including income attributable to noncontrolling interests was 22.2% for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 compared to 26.4% for the prior year period. Our effective tax rate on income from continuing operations excluding income attributable to noncontrolling interests was 26.9% for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 compared to 27.5% for the prior year period. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 was lower than the statutory rate as a result of tax preferred items including the dividends received deduction and low income housing tax credits, as well as a $17 million benefit in the first quarter of 2014 related to the completion of an IRS audit. In July 2014, the IRS issued a Directive with respect to the hedging of variable annuity guaranteed minimum benefits. The Directive provides an elective safe harbor method of tax accounting for hedge gains and losses related to variable annuity guaranteed benefits. On October 8, 2014, we filed with the IRS an application for change in accounting method, to conform, in part, to the Directive. If accepted by the IRS, the change in accounting method could have a material impact on our current and deferred income tax balances.Results of Operations by Segment for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2014 and 2013 Operating earnings is the measure of segment profit or loss management uses to evaluate segment performance. Operating earnings should not be viewed as a substitute for GAAP income from continuing operations before income tax provision. We believe the presentation of segment operating earnings as we measure it for management purposes enhances the understanding of our business by reflecting the underlying performance of our core operations and facilitating a more meaningful trend analysis. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the presentation of segment results and our definition of operating earnings.The following table presents summary financial information by segment: Nine Months Ended September 30, 2014 2013 (in millions)Advice & Wealth Management   Net revenues$3,557 $3,168Expenses2,977 2,736Operating earnings$580 $432Asset Management   Net revenues$2,490 $2,345Expenses1,900 1,841Operating earnings$590 $504Annuities   Net revenues$1,942 $1,908Expenses1,468 1,451Operating earnings$474 $457Protection   Net revenues$1,687 $1,622Expenses1,471 1,360Operating earnings$216 $262Corporate & Other   Net revenues$3 $8Expenses186 163Operating loss$(183) $(155)79AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC.

The negative impact of lower spreads on cash sweep accounts and certificates was approximately $9 million compared to the prior year period. Pretax operating margin was 16.3% for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 compared to 13.6% for the prior year period.Net RevenuesNet revenues exclude net realized gains or losses. Net revenues increased $389 million, or 12%, to $3.6 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 compared to $3.2 billion for the prior year period primarily reflecting wrap account net inflows and market appreciation, partially offset by the negative impact of low interest rates. Operating net revenue per branded advisor increased to $367,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2014, up 13%, from $324,000 the prior year period driven primarily by asset growth. Total branded advisors were 9,696 at September 30, 2014 compared to 9,761 at September 30, 2013.Management and financial advice fees increased $284 million, or 19%, to $1.8 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 compared to $1.5 billion for the prior year period driven by growth in wrap account assets. Average wrap account assets increased $27.1 billion, or 20%, compared to the prior year period due to net inflows and market appreciation. See our discussion of the changes in wrap account assets above.Distribution fees increased $85 million, or 5%, to $1.6 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 compared to $1.6 billion for the prior year period primarily due to higher client assets.ExpensesTotal expenses increased $241 million, or 9%, to $3.0 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 compared to $2.7 billion for the prior year period due to a $235 million increase in distribution expenses driven by higher compensation due to growth in client assets.Asset ManagementIn aggregate, we voluntarily waived fees of $9 million for both the nine months ended September 30, 2014 and 2013.

Total segment AUM net outflows were $3.6 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2014. Management expects, consistent with prior patterns of outflows, that outflows of primarily low margin assets directly or indirectly affiliated with Threadneedle and Columbia former parent companies will continue for the foreseeable future. The overall impact to segment results is difficult to quantify due to uncertain timing, volume and mix of the outflows. Columbia managed assets increased $0.9 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2014 primarily due to market appreciation, partially offset by net outflows. Total Columbia net outflows were $4.8 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2014. Columbia retail funds decreased $2.3 billion, or 1%, during the nine months ended September 30, 2014 primarily due to net outflows and distributions, partially offset by market appreciation. Columbia retail net outflows of $4.4 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2014 included $8.8 billion of outflows, partially offset by $4.4 billion of reinvested dividends, some of which was related to normal seasonal increases in the second quarter from funds underlying our variable annuity products. Columbia retail net new outflows for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 included $3.8 billion of outflows in the defined contribution/83AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. investment only channel, $1.0 billion of outflows from a former parent affiliated distribution relationship, $1.1 billion of outflows in the RIA channel and $0.5 billion of outflows from a third party sub-advisor. Columbia institutional AUM increased $2.4 billion, or 3%, during the nine months ended September 30, 2014 due to market appreciation, partially offset by net outflows of $0.9 billion. Outflows reflect former parent affiliated distribution and former parent influenced mandates, partially offset by third party institutional inflows. Threadneedle managed assets increased $3.0 billion, or 2%, during the nine months ended September 30, 2014 due to net inflows and market appreciation, partially offset by a negative impact of foreign currency translation. Threadneedle retail funds decreased $2.4 billion, or 5%, during the nine months ended September 30, 2014 primarily due to net outflows and the negative impact of foreign currency translation. Threadneedle retail net outflows were $1.9 billion reflecting approximately $4.1 billion of outflows from the U.S. equities product where we had a portfolio manager change earlier in the year offset by otherwise strong underlying net inflows. Threadneedle institutional AUM increased $5.3 billion, or 6%, during the nine months ended September 30, 2014 primarily due to net inflows and a market appreciation, partially offset by a negative impact of foreign currency translation. Threadneedle institutional net inflows of $3.1 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2014 included a $5.6 billion mandate from a leading UK wealth management firm to manage assets in a Strategic Managed fund, partially offset by $2.6 billion of outflows from legacy insurance assets.

Net RevenuesNet revenues, which exclude net realized gains or losses, increased $145 million, or 6%, to $2.5 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 compared to $2.3 billion for the prior year period driven by an increase in management and financial advice fees, partially offset by a decrease in net investment income.Management and financial advice fees increased $149 million, or 8%, to $2.1 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 compared to $1.9 billion for the prior year period primarily due to an increase in assets under management. Average assets under management increased 9% compared to the prior year period driven by equity market appreciation, partially offset by net outflows. See our discussion above on the changes in assets under management.Distribution fees increased $20 million, or 6%, to $368 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 compared to $348 million for the prior year period primarily due to higher assets levels due to market appreciation, partially offset by the impact of net outflows.84AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. Net investment income decreased $26 million, or 52%, to $24 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 compared to $50 million for the prior year period due to a $30 million gain on the sale of Threadneedle’s investment in Cofunds in the prior year period.ExpensesTotal expenses increased $59 million, or 3%, to $1.9 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 compared to $1.8 billion for the prior year period primarily due to an increase in distribution expenses and an increase in general and administrative expense. Distribution expenses increased $36 million, or 4%, to $863 million for the three months ended September 30, 2014 compared to $827 million for the prior year period primarily due to higher average retail fund assets, partially offset by net outflows. General and administrative expense increased $22 million, or 2%, to $1.0 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2014 compared to $984 million for the prior year period due to higher performance driven compensation, negative impacts of foreign exchange rates and investments in the business, partially offset by lower expenses as a result of net outflows for the period.AnnuitiesThe following table presents the results of operations of our Annuities segment on an operating basis: Nine Months Ended September 30,     2014 2013 Change (in millions)  Revenues       Management and financial advice fees$563 $523 $40 8 %Distribution fees270 252 18 7Net investment income711 784 (73) (9)Premiums84 81 3 4Other revenues314 268 46 17Total revenues1,942 1,908 34 2Banking and deposit interest expense— — — —Total net revenues1,942 1,908 34 2Expenses       Distribution expenses326 307 19 6Interest credited to fixed accounts423 490 (67) (14)Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses335 396 (61) (15)Amortization of deferred acquisition costs183 66 117 NMInterest and debt expense28 26 2 8General and administrative expense173 166 7 4Total expenses1,468 1,451 17 1Operating earnings$474 $457 $17 4 %NM Not Meaningful.Our Annuities segment pretax operating income, which excludes net realized gains or losses and the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits (net of hedges and the related DSIC and DAC amortization), increased $17 million, or 4%, to $474 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 compared to $457 million for the prior year period due to a benefit from policyholder movement of investments in Portfolio Navigator funds under certain in force variable annuities with living benefit guarantees to the Portfolio Stabilizer funds and market appreciation partially offset by the impact of unlocking. The impact of unlocking was a decrease to pretax operating income of $22 million for the third quarter of 2014 compared to an increase of $60 million for the prior year period. During the fourth quarter of 2013, we added Portfolio Stabilizer fund options for our in force variable annuities with living benefit guarantees. During the nine months ended September 30, 2014, approximately $4.1 billion of account value was moved into these funds, exceeding expectations. The resulting earnings benefit for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 was $42 million.RiverSource variable annuity account balances increased 5% to $76.1 billion at September 30, 2014 compared to the prior year period due to market appreciation, partially offset by net outflows of $1.6 billion. RiverSource fixed annuity account balances declined 8% to $12.4 billion at September 30, 2014 compared to the prior year period reflecting expected elevated surrenders on products sold through third parties where crediting rates have reset. This decline was offset by the change in crediting rates, which decreased the 85AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. level of spread compression for the nine months ended September 30, 2014. Approximately 98% of the five-year guarantee block totaling $4.1 billion has been re-priced as of September 30, 2014.Net RevenuesNet revenues, which exclude net realized gains or losses, increased $34 million, or 2%, to $1.9 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 compared to $1.9 billion for the prior year period primarily due to an increase in management and financial advice fees and other revenues partially offset by a decrease in net investment income.Management and financial advice fees increased $40 million, or 8%, to $563 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 compared to $523 million for the prior year period due to higher fees on variable annuities driven by higher separate account balances. Average variable annuity account balances increased $5.1 billion, or 8%, compared to the prior year period due to market appreciation, partially offset by net outflows.Distribution fees increased $18 million, or 7%, to $270 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 compared to $252 million for the prior year period due to higher fees on variable annuities driven by higher separate account balances.Net investment income, which excludes net realized gains or losses, decreased $73 million, or 9%, to $711 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 compared to $784 million for the prior year period primarily reflecting a decrease of approximately $25 million from lower invested assets due to fixed annuity net outflows and approximately $52 million from lower interest rates.Other revenues increased $46 million, or 17%, to $314 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 compared to $268 million for the prior year period due to higher fees from variable annuity guarantee sales in the prior year where the fees start on the first anniversary date.ExpensesTotal expenses, which exclude the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits (net of hedges and the related DSIC and DAC amortization) increased $17 million, or 1%, to $1.5 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 compared to $1.5 billion for the prior year period primarily due to an increase in amortization of DAC, partially offset by a decrease in interest credited to fixed accounts and benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses. Distribution expenses increased $19 million, or 6%, to $326 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 compared to $307 million for the prior year period primarily due to higher variable annuity compensation driven by higher variable annuity contact values.Interest credited to fixed accounts decreased $67 million, or 14%, to $423 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 compared to $490 million for the prior year period driven by lower average fixed annuity account balances and a lower average crediting rate on interest sensitive fixed annuities. Average fixed annuity account balances decreased $827 million, or 6%, to $12.8 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 compared to the prior year period due to net outflows reflecting expected elevated surrenders on products sold through third parties where rates have reset. The average fixed annuity crediting rate excluding capitalized interest decreased to 3.1% for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 compared to 3.6% for the prior year period reflecting the re-pricing of the five-year guarantee block.Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses, which exclude the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits (net of hedges and the related DSIC amortization), decreased $61 million, or 15%, to $335 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 compared to $396 million for the prior year period primarily due to a $50 million benefit from policyholder movement of investments in Portfolio Navigator funds under certain in force variable annuities with living benefit guarantees to the Portfolio Stabilizer funds, partially offset by an increase in expense of $21 million related to higher reserve funding driven by the impact of higher fees from variable annuity guarantee sales in the prior year where the fees start on the first anniversary date and the impact of unlocking. Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 included a $5 million expense from unlocking primarily reflecting the difference between our previously assumed interest rates versus the continued low interest rate environment, partially offset by a benefit from updating our variable annuity living benefit withdrawal utilization assumption. Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses for the prior year period included a $21 million expense from unlocking primarily reflecting the impact of variable annuity model changes.Amortization of DAC, which excludes the DAC offset to the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits, increased $117 million to $183 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 compared to $66 million for the prior year period primarily reflecting the impact of unlocking. Amortization of DAC for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 included a $17 million expense from unlocking primarily driven by the difference between our previously assumed interest rates versus the continued low interest rate environment, partially offset by favorable persistency and mortality experience and a benefit from updating our variable annuity living benefit withdrawal utilization assumption. Amortization of DAC for the prior year period included an $81 million benefit from unlocking primarily driven by the impact of assumed interest rates and changes in assumed policyholder behavior. In addition, amortization of DAC for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 included an $8 million expense related to the DAC offset to the benefit from policyholder movement of investments in Portfolio Navigator funds under certain in force variable annuities with living benefit guarantees to the Portfolio Stabilizer funds.86AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC.

Auto and home policies in force increased 11% compared to the prior year period.Other revenues decreased $13 million, or 4%, to $288 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 compared to $301 million for the prior year period due to a $29 million unfavorable impact from unlocking for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 compared to an $18 million unfavorable impact in the prior year period. The primary driver of the unlocking impact to other revenues in both periods was lower projected gains on reinsurance contracts resulting from favorable mortality experience.ExpensesTotal expenses, which exclude the market impact on indexed universal life benefits (net of hedges and the related DAC amortization), increased $111 million, or 8%, to $1.5 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 compared to $1.4 billion for the prior year period primarily due to higher expenses related to our auto and home business and the impact of unlocking.Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses increased $98 million, or 11%, to $1.0 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 compared to $918 million for the prior year period due to the impact of unlocking and higher auto and home claim and claim adjustment expense, partially offset by an $8 million increase in disability income reserves in the second quarter of 87AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. 2013 related to prior periods. The increase in auto and home claim and claim adjustment expense reflected the impact of growth in exposures due to a 7% increase in gross new policies, an increase in catastrophe losses due to severe weather and a $30 million increase in auto liability reserves in the first quarter of 2014 based upon additional analysis and information regarding continued adverse development of bodily injury claims associated with prior accident years. Catastrophe losses were $56 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 compared to $35 million for the prior year period. The impact of unlocking was an expense of $1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 primarily driven by the difference between our previously assumed interest rates versus the continued low interest rate environment, partially offset by favorable mortality experience. The impact of unlocking was a benefit of $4 million for the prior year period primarily driven by favorable mortality experience.Corporate & OtherThe following table presents the results of operations of our Corporate & Other segment on an operating basis: Nine Months Ended September 30,     2014 2013 Change (in millions)  Revenues       Distribution fees$1 $1 $— — %Net investment income (loss)(4) 2 (6) NMOther revenues6 5 1 20Total revenues3 8 (5) (63)Banking and deposit interest expense— — — —Total net revenues3 8 (5) (63)Expenses       Distribution expenses1 1 — —Interest and debt expense16 11 5 45General and administrative expense169 151 18 12Total expenses186 163 23 14Operating loss$(183) $(155) $(28) (18)%NM Not Meaningful.Our Corporate & Other segment pretax operating loss excludes net realized gains or losses, the impact of consolidating CIEs and restructuring charges. Our Corporate & Other segment pretax operating loss was $183 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 compared to $155 million for the prior year period. Our Corporate & Other segment results for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 included higher expenses primarily related to the early redemption of our senior notes due 2039, an incremental increase to a provision for potential resolution of a regulatory matter which was recorded during the second quarter and long-term performance compensation awards.Market RiskOur primary market risk exposures are interest rate, equity price, foreign currency exchange rate and credit risk. Equity price and interest rate fluctuations can have a significant impact on our results of operations, primarily due to the effects they have on the asset management and other asset-based fees we earn, the spread income generated on our fixed annuities, fixed insurance, brokerage client cash balances, face-amount certificate products and the fixed portion of our variable annuities and variable insurance contracts, the value of DAC and DSIC assets, the value of liabilities for guaranteed benefits associated with our variable annuities and the value of derivatives held to hedge these benefits.Our earnings from fixed annuities, fixed insurance, and the fixed portion of variable annuities and variable insurance contracts are based upon the spread between rates earned on assets held and the rates at which interest is credited to accounts. We primarily invest in fixed rate securities to fund the rate credited to clients. We guarantee an interest rate to the holders of these products. Investment assets and client liabilities generally differ as it relates to basis, repricing or maturity characteristics. Rates credited to clients’ accounts generally reset at shorter intervals than the yield on the underlying investments. Therefore, in an increasing interest rate environment, higher interest rates may be reflected in crediting rates to clients sooner than in rates earned on invested assets, which could result in a reduced spread between the two rates, reduced earned income and a negative impact on pretax income. However, the current low interest rate environment is resulting in interest rates below the level of some of our liability guaranteed minimum interest rates (“GMIRs”). Hence, a modest rise in interest rates would not necessarily result in changes to all the liability credited rates while projected asset purchases would capture the full increase in interest rates. This dynamic would result in widening spreads under a 88AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. modestly rising rate scenario given the current relationship between the current level of interest rates and the underlying GMIRs on the business. As a result of the low interest rate environment, our current reinvestment yields are generally lower than the current portfolio yield. We expect our portfolio income yields to continue to decline in future periods if interest rates remain low. The carrying value and weighted average yield of non-structured fixed maturity securities and commercial mortgage loans that may generate proceeds to reinvest through 2015 due to prepayment, maturity or call activity at the option of the issuer, excluding securities with a make-whole provision, were $2.6 billion and 3.8%, respectively, as of September 30, 2014. In addition, residential mortgage-backed securities, which are subject to prepayment risk as a result of the low interest rate environment, totaled $6.2 billion and had a weighted average yield of 3.1% as of September 30, 2014. While these amounts represent investments that could be subject to reinvestment risk, it is also possible that these investments will be used to fund liabilities or may not be prepaid and will remain invested at their current yields. In addition to the interest rate environment, the mix of benefit payments versus product sales as well as the timing and volumes associated with such mix may impact our investment yield. Furthermore, reinvestment activities and the associated investment yield may also be impacted by corporate strategies implemented at management’s discretion. The average yield for investment purchases during the nine months ended September 30, 2014 was approximately 2.7%.The reinvestment of proceeds from maturities, calls and prepayments at rates below the current portfolio yield, which may be below the level of some liability guaranteed minimum interest rates, will have a negative impact to future operating results. To mitigate the unfavorable impact that the low interest rate environment has on our spread income, we assess reinvestment risk in our investment portfolio and monitor this risk in accordance with our asset/liability management framework. In addition, we may reduce the crediting rates on our fixed products when warranted, subject to guaranteed minimums. In the first nine months of 2014, we continued the process of setting lower renewal interest rates for a portion of our fixed annuities that are above the guaranteed minimum interest rates, which helps relieve some of the spread compression caused by low rates. Approximately 98% of the five-year guarantee block totaling $4.1 billion has been re-priced as of September 30, 2014.The following table presents the account values of fixed annuities, fixed insurance, and the fixed portion of variable annuities and variable insurance contracts by range of guaranteed minimum crediting rates and the range of the difference between rates credited to contractholders as of September 30, 2014 and the respective guaranteed minimums, as well as the percentage of account values subject to rate reset in the time period indicated. Rates are reset at our discretion, subject to guaranteed minimums.

Each of these guaranteed benefits guarantees payouts to the annuity holder under certain specific conditions regardless of the performance of the underlying invested assets.The variable annuity guarantees continue to be managed by utilizing a hedging program which attempts to match the sensitivity of the assets with the sensitivity of the liabilities. This approach works with the premise that matched sensitivities will produce a highly 89AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. effective hedging result. Our comprehensive hedging program focuses mainly on first order sensitivities of assets and liabilities: Equity Market Level (Delta), Interest Rate Level (Rho) and Volatility (Vega). Additionally, various second order sensitivities are managed. We use various index options across the term structure, interest rate swaps and swaptions, total return swaps and futures to manage the risk exposures. The exposures are measured and monitored daily, and adjustments to the hedge portfolio are made as necessary.We have a macro hedge program to provide protection against the statutory tail scenario risk arising from variable annuity reserves on our statutory surplus and to cover some of the residual risks not covered by other hedging activities. We assess the residual risk under a range of scenarios in creating and executing the macro hedge program. As a means of economically hedging these risks, we use a combination of options and/or swaps. Certain of the macro hedge derivatives used contain settlement provisions linked to both equity returns and interest rates; the remaining are interest rate contracts or equity contracts. The macro hedge program could result in additional earnings volatility as changes in the value of the macro hedge derivatives, which are designed to reduce statutory capital volatility, may not be closely aligned to changes in the variable annuity guarantee embedded derivatives.To evaluate interest rate and equity price risk we perform sensitivity testing which measures the impact on pretax income from the sources listed below for a 12-month period following a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates or a hypothetical 10% decline in equity prices. The interest rate risk test assumes a sudden 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve, with rates then staying at those levels for the next 12 months. The equity price risk test assumes a sudden 10% drop in equity prices, with equity prices then staying at those levels for the next 12 months. In estimating the values of variable annuity riders, equity indexed annuities, stock market certificates, indexed universal life insurance and the associated hedge assets, we assume no change in implied market volatility despite the 10% drop in equity prices.The following tables present our estimate of the impact on pretax income from the above defined hypothetical market movements as of September 30, 2014:  Equity Price Exposure to Pretax IncomeEquity Price Decline 10% BeforeHedge Impact Hedge Impact Net Impact  (in millions)Asset-based management and distribution fees (1) $(251) $4 $(247)DAC and DSIC amortization (2) (3) (98) — (98)Variable annuity riders:      GMDB and GMIB (3) (100) — (100)GMWB (229) 216 (13)GMAB (35) 32 (3)DAC and DSIC amortization (4) N/A N/A 3Total variable annuity riders (364) 248 (113)Macro hedge program (5) — 19 19Equity indexed annuities 1 (1) —Certificates 3 (3) —Indexed universal life insurance 14 (18) (4)Total $(695) $249 $(443)90AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC.

This is a significantly more conservative estimate than if we assumed management follows its mean reversion guideline and increased near-term rates to recover the drop in equity values over a five-year period. We make this same conservative assumption in estimating the impact from GMDB and GMIB riders.(4) Market impact on DAC and DSIC amortization related to variable annuity riders is modeled net of hedge impact.(5) The market impact of the macro hedge program is modeled net of any related impact to DAC and DSIC amortization.The above results compare to an estimated negative net impact to pretax income of $389 million related to a 10% equity price decline and an estimated positive net impact to pretax income of $49 million related to a 100 basis point increase in interest rates as of December 31, 2013. Net impacts shown in the above table from GMWB and GMAB riders result largely from differences between the liability valuation basis and the hedging basis. Liabilities are valued using fair value accounting principles, with risk margins incorporated in contractholder behavior assumptions and with discount rates increased to reflect a current market estimate of our risk of nonperformance specific to these liabilities. The nonperformance spread risk is not hedged.Actual results could differ materially from those illustrated above as they are based on a number of estimates and assumptions. These include assuming that implied market volatility does not change when equity prices fall by 10%, that management does not increase assumed equity asset growth rates to anticipate recovery of the drop in equity values when valuing DAC, DSIC and GMDB and GMIB liability values and that the 100 basis point increase in interest rates is a parallel shift of the yield curve. Furthermore, we have not tried to anticipate changes in client preferences for different types of assets or other changes in client behavior, nor have we tried to anticipate actions management might take to increase revenues or reduce expenses in these scenarios.The selection of a 100 basis point interest rate increase as well as a 10% equity price decline should not be construed as a prediction of future market events. Impacts of larger or smaller changes in interest rates or equity prices may not be proportional to those shown for a 100 basis point increase in interest rates or a 10% decline in equity prices.Fair Value MeasurementsWe report certain assets and liabilities at fair value; specifically, separate account assets, derivatives, embedded derivatives, properties held by our consolidated property funds, and most investments and cash equivalents. Fair value assumes the exchange of assets or liabilities occurs in orderly transactions and is not the result of a forced liquidation or distressed sale. We include actual market prices, or observable inputs, in our fair value measurements to the extent available. Broker quotes are obtained when quotes from pricing services are not available. We validate prices obtained from third parties through a variety of means such as: price variance analysis, subsequent sales testing, stale price review, price comparison across pricing vendors and due diligence reviews of vendors. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our fair value measurements.91AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. Fair Value of Liabilities and Nonperformance RiskCompanies are required to measure the fair value of liabilities at the price that would be received to transfer the liability to a market participant (an exit price). Since there is not a market for the obligations of our variable annuity riders and indexed universal life insurance, we consider the assumptions participants in a hypothetical market would make to reflect an exit price. As a result, we adjust the valuation of variable annuity riders and indexed universal life insurance by updating certain contractholder assumptions, adding explicit margins to provide for profit, risk and expenses, and adjusting the rates used to discount expected cash flows to reflect a current market estimate of our nonperformance risk. The nonperformance risk adjustment is based on broker quotes for credit default swaps that are adjusted to estimate the risk of our life insurance company subsidiaries not fulfilling these liabilities. Consistent with general market conditions, this estimate resulted in a spread over the LIBOR swap curve as of September 30, 2014. As our estimate of this spread widens or tightens, the liability will decrease or increase. If this nonperformance credit spread moves to a zero spread over the LIBOR swap curve, the reduction to net income would be approximately $120 million, net of DAC, DSIC, unearned revenue amortization, the reinsurance accrual and income taxes (calculated at the statutory tax rate of 35%), based on September 30, 2014 credit spreads. Liquidity and Capital Resources OverviewWe maintained substantial liquidity during the nine months ended September 30, 2014. At September 30, 2014, we had $2.9 billion in cash and cash equivalents compared to $2.6 billion at December 31, 2013. We have additional liquidity available through an unsecured revolving credit facility for up to $500 million that expires in September 2018. Under the terms of the underlying credit agreement, we can increase this facility to $750 million upon satisfaction of certain approval requirements. Available borrowings under this facility are reduced by any outstanding letters of credit. At September 30, 2014, we had no outstanding borrowings under this credit facility and had $2.0 million of outstanding letters of credit. Our junior subordinated notes due 2066 and credit facility contain various administrative, reporting, legal and financial covenants. We were in compliance with all such covenants at September 30, 2014.On September 18, 2014, the Company issued $550 million of unsecured senior notes due October 15, 2024, and incurred debt issuance costs of $5 million. Interest payments are due semi-annually in arrears on April 15 and October 15, commencing on April 15, 2015. In May 2014, we issued a notice of redemption for $200 million of our senior notes due 2039. The notes were redeemed on June 16, 2014 pursuant to the terms of the indenture at the principal value plus accrued interest to the redemption date. We recognized an expense for the remaining unamortized debt issuance costs on the notes in the second quarter of 2014.We enter into short-term borrowings, which may include repurchase agreements and Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) advances, to reduce reinvestment risk from higher levels of expected annuity net cash flows. Short-term borrowings allow us to receive cash to reinvest in longer-duration assets, while paying back the short-term debt with cash flows generated by the fixed income portfolio. The balance of repurchase agreements at both September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013 was $50 million, which is collateralized with agency residential mortgage backed securities and commercial mortgage backed securities from our investment portfolio. Our subsidiary, RiverSource Life Insurance Company (“RiverSource Life”), is a member of the FHLB of Des Moines, which provides access to collateralized borrowings. As of September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013, we had $150 million and $450 million, respectively, of borrowings from the FHLB, which is collateralized with commercial mortgage backed securities. We believe cash flows from operating activities, available cash balances and our availability of revolver borrowings will be sufficient to fund our operating liquidity needs.Dividends from SubsidiariesAmeriprise Financial is primarily a parent holding company for the operations carried out by our wholly owned subsidiaries. Because of our holding company structure, our ability to meet our cash requirements, including the payment of dividends on our common stock, substantially depends upon the receipt of dividends or return of capital from our subsidiaries, particularly our life insurance subsidiary, RiverSource Life, our face-amount certificate subsidiary, Ameriprise Certificate Company (“ACC”), AMPF Holding Corporation, which is the parent company of our retail introducing broker-dealer subsidiary, Ameriprise Financial Services, Inc. (“AFSI”) and our clearing broker-dealer subsidiary, American Enterprise Investment Services, Inc. (“AEIS”), our Auto and Home insurance subsidiary, IDS Property Casualty Insurance Company (“IDS Property Casualty”), doing business as Ameriprise Auto & Home Insurance, our transfer agent subsidiary, Columbia Management Investment Services Corp., our investment advisory company, Columbia Management Investment Advisers, LLC, and Threadneedle. The payment of dividends by many of our subsidiaries is restricted and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to regulatory capital requirements.92AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. Actual capital and regulatory capital requirements for our wholly owned subsidiaries subject to regulatory capital requirements were as follows: Actual Capital Regulatory Capital Requirements September 30, 2014 December 31, 2013 September 30, 2014 December 31, 2013 (in millions)RiverSource Life(1)(2)$3,412 $2,747 N/A $591RiverSource Life of NY(1)(2)297 251 N/A 49IDS Property Casualty(1)(3)584 531 $194 177Ameriprise Insurance Company(1)(3)45 44 2 2ACC(4)(5)246 230 227 215Threadneedle(6)236 257 207 158Ameriprise National Trust Bank(7)18 19 10 10AFSI(3)(4)88 78 — 2Ameriprise Captive Insurance Company(3)73 62 11 11Ameriprise Trust Company(3)26 58 23 56AEIS(3)(4)106 100 50 44RiverSource Distributors, Inc.(3)(4)13 23 # #Columbia Management Investment Distributors, Inc.(3)(4)19 23 # #N/A Not applicable.# Amounts are less than $1 million.(1) Actual capital is determined on a statutory basis.(2) Regulatory capital requirement is based on the statutory risk-based capital filing.(3) Regulatory capital requirement is based on the applicable regulatory requirement, calculated as of September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013.(4) Actual capital is determined on an adjusted GAAP basis.(5) ACC is required to hold capital in compliance with the Minnesota Department of Commerce and SEC capital requirements.(6) Actual capital and regulatory capital requirements are determined in accordance with U.K. regulatory legislation.

In addition, Threadneedle paid a non-cash dividend of $152 million to the parent holding company consisting of a note receivable. During the nine months ended September 30, 2013, the parent holding company received cash dividends or a return of capital from its subsidiaries of $1.3 billion (including $675 million from RiverSource Life) and contributed cash to its subsidiaries of $44 million.Dividends Paid to Shareholders and Share Repurchases We paid regular quarterly dividends to our shareholders totaling $326 million and $307 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively. On October 28, 2014, we announced a quarterly dividend of $0.58 per common share. The dividend will be paid on November 21, 2014 to our shareholders of record at the close of business on November 10, 2014.In October 2012, our Board of Directors authorized an expenditure of up to $2.0 billion for the repurchase of shares of our common stock through 2014. In April 2014, our Board of Directors authorized an expenditure of up to an additional $2.5 billion for the repurchase of shares of our common stock through April 28, 2016. As of September 30, 2014, the Company had $2.1 billion remaining under its share repurchase authorization. We intend to fund share repurchases through existing working capital, future earnings and other customary financing methods. The share repurchase programs do not require the purchase of any minimum number of shares, and depending on market conditions and other factors, these purchases may be commenced or suspended at any time without prior notice. Acquisitions under the share repurchase programs may be made in the open market, through privately negotiated transactions or block trades or other means. During the nine months ended September 30, 2014, we repurchased a total of 9.1 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $114.19 per share.93AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. Cash FlowsCash flows of CIEs are reflected in our cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities, investing activities and financing activities. Cash held by CIEs is not available for general use by Ameriprise Financial, nor is Ameriprise Financial cash available for general use by its CIEs. As such, the operating, investing and financing cash flows of the CIEs have no impact to the change in cash and cash equivalents.Operating ActivitiesNet cash provided by operating activities was $2.0 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $1.1 billion for the prior year period. The change in net cash provided by operating activities compared to prior year period was primarily due to a $534 million increase in cash flows related to net sales of investment properties held by CIEs, a $276 million increase in cash flows related to changes in amounts due to brokers and an increase in fee revenue partially offset by related expenses.Investing ActivitiesOur investing activities primarily relate to our Available-for-Sale investment portfolio. Further, this activity is significantly affected by the net flows of our investment certificate, fixed annuity and universal life products reflected in financing activities.Net cash used in investing activities increased $29 million to $172 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 compared to $143 million for the prior year period primarily due to a $572 million decrease in proceeds from sales, maturities and repayments of investments by consolidated investment entities and a $970 million decrease in proceeds from maturities, sinking fund payments and calls of Available-for-Sale securities, partially offset by a $1.6 billion decrease in cash used for purchases of Available-for-Sale securities.Financing ActivitiesNet cash used in financing activities increased $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 compared to $207 million for the prior year period. Cash outflows from policyholder account balances increased $593 million compared to the prior year period. Cash outflows related to investment certificates and banking time deposits increased $127 million compared to the prior period. Cash outflows from changes in short-term borrowings increased $299 million compared to the prior year period as we reduced our borrowings from the FHLB during the nine months ended September 30, 2014. Cash outflows related to repayments of debt increased $200 million due to the redemption of our senior notes due 2039 in the second quarter of 2014. Contractual CommitmentsThere have been no material changes to our contractual obligations disclosed in our 2013 10-K. Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe provide asset management services to various collateralized debt obligations and other investment products, which are sponsored by us for the investment of client assets in the normal course of business. Certain of these investment entities are considered to be variable interest entities while others are considered to be voting rights entities. We consolidate certain of these investment entities. For entities that we do not consolidate, our maximum exposure to loss is our investment in the entity, which was not material as of September 30, 2014. We have no obligation to provide further financial or other support to these structured investments nor have we provided any support to these structured investments.
