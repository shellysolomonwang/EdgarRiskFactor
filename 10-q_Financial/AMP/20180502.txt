Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2017 10-K and other factors as discussed herein.Equity price, credit market and interest rate fluctuations can have a significant impact on our results of operations, primarily due to the effects they have on the asset management and other asset-based fees we earn, the “spread” income generated on our fixed deferred annuities, fixed insurance, deposit products and the fixed portion of variable annuities and variable insurance contracts, the value of deferred acquisition costs (“DAC”) and deferred sales inducement costs (“DSIC”) assets, the values of liabilities for guaranteed benefits associated with our variable annuities and the values of derivatives held to hedge these benefits.Earnings, as well as adjusted operating earnings, will be negatively impacted by the ongoing low interest rate environment should it continue. In addition to continuing spread compression in our interest sensitive product lines, a sustained low interest rate environment may result in increases to our reserves and changes in various rate assumptions we use to amortize DAC and DSIC, which may negatively impact our adjusted operating earnings. For additional discussion on our interest rate risk, see Item 3. “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.”We consolidate certain variable interest entities for which we provide asset management services. These entities are defined as consolidated investment entities (“CIEs”). While the consolidation of the CIEs impacts our balance sheet and income statement, our exposure to these entities is unchanged and there is no impact to the underlying business results. For further information on CIEs, see Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. The results of operations of the CIEs are reflected in the Corporate & Other segment. On a consolidated basis, the management fees we earn for the services we provide to the CIEs and the related general and administrative expenses are eliminated and the changes in the fair value of assets and liabilities related to the CIEs, primarily syndicated loans and debt, are reflected in net investment income. We include the fees from these entities in the management and financial advice fees line within our Asset Management segment. While our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), management believes that adjusted operating measures, which exclude net realized investment gains or losses, net of the related DSIC and DAC amortization, unearned revenue amortization and the reinsurance accrual; the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits, net of hedges and the related DSIC and DAC amortization; the market impact on indexed universal life (“IUL”) benefits, net of hedges and the related DAC amortization, unearned revenue amortization and the reinsurance accrual; the market impact on fixed index annuity benefits, net of hedges and the related DAC amortization; the market impact of hedges to offset interest rate changes on unrealized gains or losses for certain investments; integration and restructuring charges; and the impact of consolidating CIEs, best reflect the underlying performance of our core operations and facilitate a more meaningful trend analysis. Management uses certain of these non-GAAP measures to evaluate our financial performance on a basis comparable to that used by some securities analysts and investors. Also, certain of these non-GAAP measures are taken into consideration, to varying degrees, for purposes of business planning and analysis and for certain compensation-related matters. Throughout our Management’s Discussion and Analysis, these non-GAAP measures are referred to as adjusted operating measures. These non-GAAP measures should not be viewed as a substitute for U.S. GAAP measures. Effective January 1, 2018, the Company changed the naming convention for its non-GAAP 50AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. financial measures from “operating” to “adjusted operating” to more clearly differentiate between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. The definition of these measures remains unchanged. It is management’s priority to increase shareholder value over a multi-year horizon by achieving our on-average, over-time financial targets.Our financial targets are:•Adjusted operating total net revenue growth of 6% to 8%,•Adjusted operating earnings per diluted share growth of 12% to 15%, and•Adjusted operating return on equity excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) of 19% to 23%.The following tables reconcile our GAAP measures to adjusted operating measures:  Three Months Ended March 31,2018 2017(in millions)Total net revenues$3,168 $2,926Less: Revenue attributable to CIEs22 22Less: Net realized investment gains (losses)6 17Less: Market impact on indexed universal life benefits13 1Less: Market impact of hedges on investments16 1Adjusted operating total net revenues$3,111 $2,885 Three Months Ended March 31, Per Diluted ShareThree Months Ended March 31,2018 20172018 2017(in millions, except per share amounts)Net income$594 $403 $3.91 $2.52Less: Net income (loss) attributable to CIEs— 1 — 0.01Add: Integration/restructuring charges (1)3 — 0.02 —Add: Market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits (1)5 63 0.03 0.40Add: Market impact on indexed universal life benefits (1)(25) — (0.16) —Add: Market impact of hedges on investments (1)(16) (1) (0.11) (0.01)Less: Net realized investment gains (losses) (1)6 16 0.04 0.10Tax effect of adjustments (2)8 (16) 0.05 (0.10)Adjusted operating earnings$563 $432 $3.70 $2.70        Weighted average common shares outstanding:       Basic149.5 157.5    Diluted152.1 160.1    (1) Pretax adjusted operating adjustments.(2) Calculated using the statutory tax rate of 21% in 2018 and 35% in 2017.51AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC.

After-tax is calculated using the statutory tax rate of 21% in 2018 and 35% in 2017. Adjusted operating return on equity, excluding AOCI is higher reflecting core business improvement, market appreciation and cumulative share repurchases. The Department of Labor published regulations in April 2016 that expanded the scope of who is considered an ERISA fiduciary and these regulations focus in large part on investment recommendations made by financial advisors, registered investment advisors, and other investment professionals to retirement investors, how financial advisors are able to discuss IRA rollovers, as well as how financial advisors and affiliates can transact with retirement investors. Tax qualified accounts, particularly IRAs, make up a significant portion of our assets under management and administration. The first phase of the regulations went into effect on June 9, 2017 and requires financial advisors to make recommendations related to assets held in IRAs and employer sponsored retirement plans in accordance with the following impartial conduct standards: recommendations must be in the best interest of the client, compensation paid for the recommendations must be reasonable and the financial advisor must not make any misleading statements. We adopted policies and procedures designed to comply with the impartial conduct standards and communicated those policies and procedures to our advisors and staff. The second phase of the regulation pertaining to a new “best interest contract exemption” would put into place a number of additional requirements including entering into a best interest contract with clients, enhanced disclosure of fees and conflicts of interest, limits on differential commissions within a product category, the adoption of policies and procedures to ensure the best interest standard is met, and findings related to platforms that are limited to products that pay third-party payments and/or include proprietary products. The second phase of the regulation is currently scheduled to become effective on July 1, 2019. However, on March 15, 2018, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit issued a decision vacating the Department’s regulations in its entirety. The Fifth Circuit’s decision would be effective as of the date the court files its mandate (currently scheduled for May 7, 2018). Recently, several interested parties have filed a request to intervene and to have the case reheard by the Fifth Circuit en banc. It is not clear whether the Fifth Circuit will grant either of these motions. In addition, the SEC recently proposed its own fiduciary standard that would apply to recommendations made by financial advisors who work on a commission basis and would apply regardless of the type of account (IRA or non-qualified) an investor holds. Furthermore, several states have either issued their own fiduciary rules or are considering doing so and those rules may extend to certain types of products (e.g. insurance and annuities, financial planning, etc.) or may broadly cover all recommendations made by financial advisors. The Certified Financial Planner Board has issued its own fiduciary standard that applies to financial advisors who hold a Certified Financial Planner designation. Currently, Ameriprise has approximately 4,100 financial advisors that hold a Certified 52AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. Financial Planner designation. In light of the various fiduciary rules and regulations that have been proposed or finalized, we continue to exert significant efforts to evaluate and prepare to comply with each rule. Critical Accounting EstimatesThe accounting and reporting policies that we use affect our Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of our accounting and reporting policies are critical to an understanding of our consolidated results of operations and financial condition and, in some cases, the application of these policies can be significantly affected by the estimates, judgments and assumptions made by management during the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements. These accounting policies are discussed in detail in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis — Critical Accounting Estimates” in our 2017 10-K.Recent Accounting PronouncementsFor information regarding recent accounting pronouncements and their expected impact on our future consolidated results of operations and financial condition, see Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.Assets Under Management and AdministrationAssets under management (“AUM”) include external client assets for which we provide investment management services, such as the assets of the Columbia Threadneedle Investments funds, assets of institutional clients and assets of clients in our advisor platform held in wrap accounts as well as assets managed by sub-advisors selected by us. AUM also includes certain assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets for which we provide investment management services and recognize management fees in our Asset Management segment, such as the assets of the general account and the variable product funds held in the separate accounts of our life insurance subsidiaries and CIEs. These assets do not include assets under advisement, for which we provide model portfolios but do not have full discretionary investment authority. Corporate & Other AUM primarily includes former bank assets that are managed within our Corporate & Other segment.Assets under administration (“AUA”) include assets for which we provide administrative services such as client assets invested in other companies’ products that we offer outside of our wrap accounts. These assets include those held in clients’ brokerage accounts. We generally record revenues received from administered assets as distribution fees. We do not exercise management discretion over these assets and do not earn a management fee. These assets are not reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. AUA also includes certain assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets for which we do not provide investment management services and do not recognize management fees, such as investments in non-affiliated funds held in the separate accounts of our life insurance subsidiaries. These assets do not include assets under advisement, for which we provide model portfolios but do not have full discretionary investment authority.The following table presents detail regarding our AUM and AUA: March 31, Change2018 2017(in billions)  Assets Under Management and Administration       Advice & Wealth Management AUM$249.6 $211.7 $37.9 18 %Asset Management AUM485.3 467.0 18.3 4Corporate & Other AUM— 0.3 (0.3) NMEliminations(26.3) (24.6) (1.7) (7)Total Assets Under Management708.6 654.4 54.2 8Total Assets Under Administration178.6 163.2 15.4 9Total AUM and AUA$887.2 $817.6 $69.6 9 %NM Not Meaningful.Total AUM increased $54.2 billion, or 8%, to $708.6 billion as of March 31, 2018 compared to $654.4 billion as of March 31, 2017 primarily due to a $37.9 billion increase in Advice & Wealth Management AUM driven by wrap account net inflows and market appreciation and an $18.3 billion increase in Asset Management AUM driven by market appreciation and a positive impact of foreign currency translation, partially offset by net outflows and retail fund distributions. See our segment results of operations discussion below for additional information on changes in our AUM.53AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. Consolidated Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 The following table presents our consolidated results of operations: Three Months Ended March 31, Change2018 2017(in millions)  Revenues       Management and financial advice fees$1,669 $1,487 $182 12 %Distribution fees468 441 27 6Net investment income396 391 5 1Premiums343 339 4 1Other revenues308 278 30 11Total revenues3,184 2,936 248 8Banking and deposit interest expense16 10 6 60Total net revenues3,168 2,926 242 8Expenses       Distribution expenses905 823 82 10Interest credited to fixed accounts141 162 (21) (13)Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses494 567 (73) (13)Amortization of deferred acquisition costs92 72 20 28Interest and debt expense51 50 1 2General and administrative expense789 777 12 2Total expenses2,472 2,451 21 1Pretax income696 475 221 47Income tax provision102 72 30 42Net income$594 $403 $191 47 %OverallPretax income increased $221 million, or 47%, to $696 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $475 million for the prior year period primarily reflecting market appreciation, wrap account net inflows and a positive impact from higher short-term interest rates, partially offset by the cumulative impact of asset management net outflows. The following impacts were also significant drivers of the period-over-period change in pretax income: •The market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits (net of hedges and the related DSIC and DAC amortization) was an expense of $5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to an expense of $63 million for the prior year period. •The market impact on indexed universal life benefits (net of hedges and the related DAC amortization, unearned revenue amortization and the reinsurance accrual) was a benefit of $25 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to nil for the prior year period.Net RevenuesNet revenues increased $242 million, or 8%, to $3.2 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $2.9 billion for the prior year period. Management and financial advice fees increased $182 million, or 12%, to $1.7 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $1.5 billion for the prior year period primarily due to an increase in AUM. Average AUM increased $75.7 billion, or 12%, compared to the prior year period due to market appreciation, wrap account net inflows and a positive impact of foreign currency translation, partially offset by asset management net outflows. See our discussion on the changes in AUM in our segment results of operations section. Distribution fees increased $27 million, or 6%, to $468 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $441 million for the prior year period primarily due to market appreciation, higher brokerage cash spread due to an increase in short-term interest rates and increased transactional activity, partially offset by a $30 million decrease related to our transition to share classes without 12b-1 fees in advisory accounts, which we completed during the first quarter of 2017.54AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. Other revenues increased $30 million, or 11%, to $308 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $278 million for the prior year period primarily due to the unearned revenue amortization and the reinsurance accrual offset to the market impact on indexed universal life benefits, a vendor credit of $14 million and higher fees from variable annuity guarantee sales in the prior year where the fees start on the first anniversary date and higher average fee rates. The unearned revenue amortization and reinsurance accrual offset to the market impact on indexed universal life benefits was a benefit of $13 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to a benefit of $1 million for the prior year period. ExpensesDistribution expenses increased $82 million, or 10%, to $905 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $823 million for the prior year period reflecting higher advisor compensation due to market appreciation and wrap account net inflows and increased transactional activity, partially offset by a $16 million decrease from changes related to our transition to share classes without 12b-1 fees in advisory accounts. Interest credited to fixed accounts decreased $21 million, or 13%, to $141 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $162 million for the prior year period primarily due to the market impact on indexed universal life benefits, net of hedges, which was a benefit of $21 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to nil for the prior year period. Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses decreased $73 million, or 13%, to $494 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $567 million for the prior year period primarily reflecting a $78 million decrease in expense from the unhedged nonperformance credit spread risk adjustment on variable annuity guaranteed benefits. As the embedded derivative liability on which the nonperformance credit spread is applied increases (decreases), the impact of the nonperformance credit spread is favorable (unfavorable) to expense. The favorable impact of the nonperformance credit spread was $13 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to an unfavorable impact of $65 million for the prior year period.Amortization of DAC increased $20 million, or 28%, to $92 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $72 million for the prior year period primarily reflecting the following items:•The DAC offset to the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits (net of hedges and the related DSIC amortization) was an expense of $5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to a benefit of $9 million for the prior year period.•The DAC offset to the market impact on indexed universal life benefits (net of hedges, unearned revenue amortization and the reinsurance accrual) was an expense of $9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to an expense of $1 million for the prior year period.•The impact on DAC from actual versus expected market performance based on our view of bond and equity performance was nil for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to a benefit of $9 million for the prior year period reflecting favorable equity market returns.•The positive impact on DAC from lower than expected lapses on variable annuities was $7 million.Income TaxesOur effective tax rate was 14.7% for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to 15.2% for the prior year period. See Note 16 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion on income taxes.55AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. Results of Operations by Segment for the Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 Adjusted operating earnings is the measure of segment profit or loss management uses to evaluate segment performance. Adjusted operating earnings should not be viewed as a substitute for GAAP pretax income. We believe the presentation of segment adjusted operating earnings as we measure it for management purposes enhances the understanding of our business by reflecting the underlying performance of our core operations and facilitating a more meaningful trend analysis. See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the presentation of segment results and our definition of adjusted operating earnings.The following table presents summary financial information by segment: Three Months Ended March 31,2018 2017(in millions)Advice & Wealth Management   Net revenues$1,501 $1,321Expenses1,185 1,073Adjusted operating earnings$316 $248Asset Management   Net revenues$778 $725Expenses583 575Adjusted operating earnings$195 $150Annuities   Net revenues$613 $608Expenses481 469Adjusted operating earnings$132 $139Protection   Net revenues$519 $521Expenses449 458Adjusted operating earnings$70 $63Corporate & Other   Net revenues$57 $57Expenses113 137Adjusted operating loss$(56) $(80)Advice & Wealth ManagementThe following table presents the changes in wrap account assets and average balances for the three months ended March 31: 2018 2017(in billions)Beginning balance$248.2 $201.1Net flows5.7 3.9Market appreciation (depreciation) and other(2.9) 7.9Ending balance$251.0 $212.9    Advisory wrap account assets ending balance (1)$248.7 $210.9Average advisory wrap account assets (2)$249.6 $205.4(1) Advisory wrap account assets represent those assets for which clients receive advisory services and are the primary driver of revenue earned on wrap accounts.

The change was a decrease of $0.2 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2017. In a referendum in June 2016, the United Kingdom (UK) voted to leave the European Union (EU), which caused volatility in capital and currency markets. Further, in March 2017 the UK invoked article 50 of the Treaty of Lisbon in serving its relevant notice to leave the European Union on March 30, 2019 and in March 2018 the terms of a transitional agreement, which is intended to be incorporated into the final version of the withdrawal agreement, were published, generally providing for very little change in the UK’s relationship with the EU until the end of 2020. The full impact of the British exit from the EU (commonly known as “Brexit”) remains uncertain. This uncertainty may have a negative impact on our UK and European net flows and foreign currency translation if the British Pound weakens.Total segment AUM decreased $9.3 billion, or 2%, during the three months ended March 31, 2018 driven by net outflows of $7.7 billion and market depreciation, partially offset by a positive impact of foreign currency translation. In the quarter, outflows were elevated primarily from redemptions from institutional clients that were driven by shifts in asset allocation decisions away from equity and high yield products, as well as from an institutional client seeking liquidity. Underlying U.S. retail outflows improved, with increased gross sales at top intermediary partner firms. In Europe, Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”), market volatility drove an increase in retail redemptions during the quarter.In November 2017, we completed our acquisition of Lionstone Partners, LLC (“Lionstone Investments”), a leading national real estate investment firm, specializing in investment strategies based upon proprietary analytics. The acquisition added $5.4 billion in assets under management.

Net RevenuesNet revenues, which exclude net realized investment gains or losses, increased $53 million, or 7%, to $778 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $725 million for the prior year period.Management and financial advice fees increased $48 million, or 8%, to $645 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $597 million for the prior year period driven by market appreciation, a $17 million positive foreign currency translation impact and the Lionstone acquisition, partially offset by cumulative net outflows from former parent-related assets and higher fee yielding retail funds. Our average weighted equity index, which is a proxy for equity movements on AUM, increased 17% for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the prior year period. 61AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. Other revenues increased $14 million to $17 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $3 million for the prior year period due to a vendor credit related to the completion of our front, middle and back-office integration.ExpensesTotal expenses increased $8 million, or 1%, to $583 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $575 million for the prior year period. General and administrative expense increased $16 million, or 5%, to $325 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $309 million for the prior year period reflecting a $10 million negative foreign currency translation impact, an $8 million increase related to the Lionstone acquisition, higher research costs related to MiFID II and investments in growth initiatives, partially offset by disciplined expense management.AnnuitiesThe following table presents the results of operations of our Annuities segment on an adjusted operating basis: Three Months Ended March 31, Change2018 2017(in millions)  RevenuesManagement and financial advice fees$200 $191 $9 5 %Distribution fees88 83 5 6Net investment income164 179 (15) (8)Premiums24 27 (3) (11)Other revenues137 128 9 7Total revenues613 608 5 1Banking and deposit interest expense— — — —Total net revenues613 608 5 1ExpensesDistribution expenses110 102 8 8Interest credited to fixed accounts113 118 (5) (4)Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses150 143 7 5Amortization of deferred acquisition costs50 47 3 6Interest and debt expense9 8 1 13General and administrative expense49 51 (2) (4)Total expenses481 469 12 3Adjusted operating earnings$132 $139 $(7) (5)%Our Annuities segment pretax adjusted operating income, which excludes net realized investment gains or losses (net of the related DSIC and DAC amortization), the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits (net of hedges and the related DSIC and DAC amortization) and the market impact on fixed index annuity benefits (net of hedges and the related DAC amortization), decreased $7 million, or 5%, to $132 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $139 million for the prior year period primarily due to lower investment income and the impact on DAC, DSIC and reserves for insurance features in non-traditional long-duration contracts from actual versus expected market performance based on our view of bond and equity performance, partially offset by equity market appreciation. The impact on DAC, DSIC and reserves for insurance features in non-traditional long-duration contracts from actual versus expected market performance based on our view of bond and equity performance was a benefit of $6 million (nil for DAC, nil for DSIC and $6 million for insurance features in non-traditional long duration contracts) for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to a benefit of $18 million ($8 million for DAC, $2 million for DSIC and $8 million for insurance features in non-traditional long duration contracts) for the prior year period.RiverSource variable annuity account balances increased 3% to $78.7 billion at March 31, 2018 compared to the prior year period due to equity market appreciation, partially offset by net outflows of $3.7 billion. Variable annuity net outflows for the first quarter of 2018 were lower than the prior year period driven by a 20% increase in sales, as well as lower lapses. RiverSource fixed deferred annuity account balances declined 7% to $9.1 billion at March 31, 2018 compared to the prior year period as older policies continue to lapse and new sales are limited due to low interest rates. Given the current interest rate environment, 62AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. our current fixed deferred annuity book is expected to gradually run off and earnings on our fixed deferred annuity business will trend down.Net RevenuesNet revenues, which exclude net realized investment gains or losses, increased $5 million, or 1%, to $613 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $608 million for the prior year period.Management and financial advice fees increased $9 million, or 5%, to $200 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $191 million for the prior year period due to higher fees on variable annuities driven by higher average separate account balances. Average variable annuity account balances increased $4.6 billion, or 6%, from the prior year period due to market appreciation, partially offset by net outflows.Net investment income, which excludes net realized investment gains or losses, decreased $15 million, or 8%, to $164 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $179 million for the prior year period reflecting a decrease of approximately $8 million from lower earned interest rates and approximately $7 million from lower invested assets due to fixed annuity net outflows.Other revenues increased $9 million, or 7%, to $137 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $128 million for the prior year period due to higher fees from variable annuity guarantee sales in the prior year where the fees start on the first anniversary date and higher average fee rates.ExpensesTotal expenses, which exclude the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits (net of hedges and the related DSIC and DAC amortization), the market impact on fixed index annuity benefits (net of hedges and the related DAC amortization) and the DAC and DSIC offset to net realized investment gains or losses, increased $12 million, or 3%, to $481 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $469 million for the prior year period. Distribution expenses increased $8 million, or 8%, to $110 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $102 million for the prior year period primarily reflecting equity market appreciation.Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses, which exclude the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits (net of hedges and the related DSIC amortization) and the DSIC offset to net realized investment gains or losses, increased $7 million, or 5%, to $150 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $143 million for the prior year period primarily reflecting higher reserve funding driven by the impact of higher fees from variable annuity guarantee sales in the prior year period where the fees start on the first anniversary date.ProtectionThe following table presents the results of operations of our Protection segment on an adjusted operating basis: Three Months Ended March 31, Change2018 2017(in millions)  RevenuesManagement and financial advice fees$14 $14 $— — %Distribution fees24 24 — —Net investment income84 85 (1) (1)Premiums301 294 7 2Other revenues96 104 (8) (8)Total revenues519 521 (2) —Banking and deposit interest expense— — — —Total net revenues519 521 (2) —ExpensesDistribution expenses16 17 (1) (6)Interest credited to fixed accounts49 44 5 11Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses292 297 (5) (2)Amortization of deferred acquisition costs25 28 (3) (11)Interest and debt expense6 6 — —General and administrative expense61 66 (5) (8)Total expenses449 458 (9) (2)Adjusted operating earnings$70 $63 $7 11 %63AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC.

Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses decreased $5 million, or 2%, to $292 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $297 million for the prior year period primarily due to a decrease in net catastrophe losses and a $6 million decrease in DI insurance claims, partially offset by a higher non-catastrophe loss ratio and a volume-driven increase for auto insurance. Catastrophe losses (net of the impact of reinsurance), which were higher than anticipated in both periods due to storms, were $14 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $25 million for the prior year period.Corporate & OtherThe following table presents the results of operations of our Corporate & Other segment on an adjusted operating basis: Three Months Ended March 31, Change2018 2017(in millions)  RevenuesNet investment income$30 $28 $2 7 %Premiums26 27 (1) (4)Other revenues2 2 — —Total revenues58 57 1 2Banking and deposit interest expense1 — 1 —Total net revenues57 57 — —ExpensesDistribution expenses(2) (3) 1 33Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses56 58 (2) (3)Amortization of deferred acquisition costs— — — —Interest and debt expense6 8 (2) (25)General and administrative expense53 74 (21) (28)Total expenses113 137 (24) (18)Adjusted operating loss$(56) $(80) $24 30 %Our Corporate & Other segment pretax adjusted operating loss excludes net realized investment gains or losses, the market impact of hedges to offset interest rate changes on unrealized gains or losses for certain investments, integration and restructuring charges, and the impact of consolidating CIEs. Our Corporate & Other segment pretax adjusted operating loss decreased $24 million, or 30%, to $56 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $80 million for the prior year period primarily due to a $21 million decrease in general and administrative expense reflecting a $7 million decline in DOL planning and implementation expenses, lower project-related costs and a $9 million expense in the prior year period related to the renegotiation of a vendor arrangement.64AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. Market Risk Our primary market risk exposures are interest rate, equity price, foreign currency exchange rate and credit risk. Equity price and interest rate fluctuations can have a significant impact on our results of operations, primarily due to the effects they have on the asset management and other asset-based fees we earn, the spread income generated on our fixed deferred annuities, fixed insurance, brokerage client cash balances, face-amount certificate products and the fixed portion of our variable annuities and variable insurance contracts, the value of DAC and DSIC assets, the value of liabilities for guaranteed benefits associated with our variable annuities and the value of derivatives held to hedge these benefits.Our earnings from fixed deferred annuities, fixed insurance, and the fixed portion of variable annuities and variable insurance contracts are based upon the spread between rates earned on assets held and the rates at which interest is credited to accounts. We primarily invest in fixed rate securities to fund the rate credited to clients. We guarantee an interest rate to the holders of these products. Investment assets and client liabilities generally differ as it relates to basis, repricing or maturity characteristics. Rates credited to clients’ accounts generally reset at shorter intervals than the yield on the underlying investments. Therefore, in an increasing interest rate environment, higher interest rates may be reflected in crediting rates to clients sooner than in rates earned on invested assets, which could result in a reduced spread between the two rates, reduced earned income and a negative impact on pretax income. However, the current low interest rate environment is resulting in interest rates below the level of some of our liability guaranteed minimum interest rates (“GMIRs”). Hence, a modest rise in interest rates would not necessarily result in changes to all the liability credited rates while projected asset purchases would capture the full increase in interest rates. This dynamic would result in widening spreads under a modestly rising rate scenario given the current relationship between the current level of interest rates and the underlying GMIRs on the business. As a result of the low interest rate environment, our current reinvestment yields are generally lower than the current portfolio yield. We expect our portfolio income yields to continue to decline in future periods if interest rates remain low. The carrying value and weighted average yield of total non-structured fixed maturity securities, certificate of deposits and commercial mortgage loans in our investment portfolio that may generate proceeds to reinvest through March 31, 2020 due to prepayment, maturity or call activity at the option of the issuer, excluding securities with a make-whole provision, were $6.1 billion and 3.7%, respectively, as of March 31, 2018. In addition, residential mortgage-backed securities, which are subject to prepayment risk as a result of the low interest rate environment, totaled $6.0 billion and had a weighted average yield of 2.91% as of March 31, 2018. While these amounts represent investments that could be subject to reinvestment risk, it is also possible that these investments will be used to fund liabilities or may not be prepaid and will remain invested at their current yields. In addition to the interest rate environment, the mix of benefit payments versus product sales as well as the timing and volumes associated with such mix may impact our investment yield. Furthermore, reinvestment activities and the associated investment yield may also be impacted by corporate strategies implemented at management’s discretion. The average yield for investment purchases during the three months ended March 31, 2018 was approximately 2.7%.The reinvestment of proceeds from maturities, calls and prepayments at rates below the current portfolio yield, which may be below the level of some liability GMIRs, will have a negative impact to future operating results. To mitigate the unfavorable impact that the low interest rate environment has on our spread income, we assess reinvestment risk in our investment portfolio and monitor this risk in accordance with our asset/liability management framework. In addition, we may reduce the crediting rates on our fixed products when warranted, subject to guaranteed minimums.In addition to the fixed rate exposures noted above, RiverSource Life also has the following variable annuity guarantee benefits: guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits (“GMWB”), guaranteed minimum accumulation benefits (“GMAB”), guaranteed minimum death benefits (“GMDB”) and guaranteed minimum income benefits (“GMIB”). Each of these benefits guarantees payouts to the annuity holder under certain specific conditions regardless of the performance of the underlying invested assets.The variable annuity guarantees continue to be managed by utilizing a hedging program which attempts to match the sensitivity of the assets with the sensitivity of the liabilities. This approach works with the premise that matched sensitivities will produce a highly effective hedging result. Our comprehensive hedging program focuses mainly on first order sensitivities of assets and liabilities: Equity Market Level (Delta), Interest Rate Level (Rho) and Volatility (Vega). Additionally, various second order sensitivities are managed. We use various index options across the term structure, interest rate swaps and swaptions, total return swaps and futures to manage the risk exposures. The exposures are measured and monitored daily, and adjustments to the hedge portfolio are made as necessary.We have a macro hedge program to provide protection against the statutory tail scenario risk arising from variable annuity reserves on our statutory surplus and to cover some of the residual risks not covered by other hedging activities. We assess the residual risk under a range of scenarios in creating and executing the macro hedge program. As a means of economically hedging these risks, we may use a combination of futures, options, swaps and swaptions. Certain of the macro hedge derivatives used contain settlement provisions linked to both equity returns and interest rates; the remaining are interest rate contracts or equity contracts. The macro hedge program could result in additional earnings volatility as changes in the value of the macro hedge derivatives, which are designed to reduce statutory capital volatility, may not be closely aligned to changes in the variable annuity guarantee embedded derivatives.65AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. To evaluate interest rate and equity price risk we perform sensitivity testing which measures the impact on pretax income from the sources listed below for a 12-month period following a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates or a hypothetical 10% decline in equity prices. The interest rate risk test assumes a sudden 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve, with rates then staying at those levels for the next 12 months. The equity price risk test assumes a sudden 10% drop in equity prices, with equity prices then staying at those levels for the next 12 months. In estimating the values of variable annuity riders, indexed annuities, stock market certificates, indexed universal life insurance and the associated hedge assets, we assume no change in implied market volatility despite the 10% drop in equity prices.The following tables present our estimate of the impact on pretax income from the above defined hypothetical market movements as of March 31, 2018:Equity Price Decline 10% Equity Price Exposure to Pretax IncomeBefore Hedge Impact Hedge Impact Net Impact  (in millions)Asset-based management and distribution fees (1) $(260) $5 $(255)DAC and DSIC amortization (2)(3) (128) — (128)Variable annuity riders:      GMDB and GMIB (3) (30) — (30)GMWB (3)(4) (385) 227 (158)GMAB (20) 20 —DAC and DSIC amortization (4) N/A N/A (2)Total variable annuity riders (435) 247 (190)Macro hedge program (5) — 36 36Indexed annuities 1 (1) —Certificates 3 (3) —Indexed universal life insurance 59 (48) 11Total $(760) $236 $(526)Interest Rate Increase 100 Basis Points Interest Rate Exposure to Pretax IncomeBefore Hedge Impact Hedge Impact Net Impact  (in millions)Asset-based management and distribution fees (1) $(56) $— $(56)Variable annuity riders:      GMDB and GMIB — — —GMWB 833 (679) 154GMAB 16 (12) 4DAC and DSIC amortization (4) N/A N/A (23)Total variable annuity riders 849 (691) 135Macro hedge program (5) — — —Indexed annuities (1) — (1)Fixed annuities, fixed insurance and fixed portion of variable annuities and variable insurance products 90 — 90Brokerage client cash balances 113 — 113Certificates 3 — 3Indexed universal life insurance 95 2 97Total $1,093 $(689) $381N/A Not Applicable.(1) Excludes incentive income which is impacted by market and fund performance during the period and cannot be readily estimated.(2) Market impact on DAC and DSIC amortization resulting from lower projected profits.(3) In estimating the impact on DAC and DSIC amortization resulting from lower projected profits, we have not changed our assumed equity asset growth rates. This is a significantly more conservative estimate than if we assumed management follows its mean reversion guideline and 66AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. increased near-term rates to recover the drop in equity values over a five-year period. We make this same conservative assumption in estimating the impact from GMDB and GMIB riders and the life contingent benefits associated with GMWB.(4) Market impact on DAC and DSIC amortization related to variable annuity riders is modeled net of hedge impact.(5) The market impact of the macro hedge program is modeled net of any related impact to DAC and DSIC amortization.The above results compare to an estimated negative net impact to pretax income of $551 million related to a 10% equity price decline and an estimated positive net impact to pretax income of $192 million related to a 100 basis point increase in interest rates as of December 31, 2017. The change in interest rate exposure was driven by variable annuity riders primarily due to changes in market rates.Net impacts shown in the above table from GMWB riders result largely from differences between the liability valuation basis and the hedging basis. Liabilities are valued using fair value accounting principles, with risk margins incorporated in contractholder behavior assumptions and with discount rates increased to reflect a current market estimate of our risk of nonperformance specific to these liabilities. Our hedging is based on our determination of economic risk, which excludes certain items in the liability valuation including the nonperformance spread risk.Actual results could differ materially from those illustrated above as they are based on a number of estimates and assumptions. These include assuming that implied market volatility does not change when equity prices fall by 10%; that management does not increase assumed equity asset growth rates to anticipate recovery of the drop in equity values when valuing DAC, DSIC and the liability values associated with GMDB, GMIB and the life contingent benefits associated with GMWB; and that the 100 basis point increase in interest rates is a parallel shift of the yield curve. Furthermore, we have not tried to anticipate changes in client preferences for different types of assets or other changes in client behavior, nor have we tried to anticipate actions management might take to increase revenues or reduce expenses in these scenarios.The selection of a 100 basis point interest rate increase as well as a 10% equity price decline should not be construed as a prediction of future market events. Impacts of larger or smaller changes in interest rates or equity prices may not be proportional to those shown for a 100 basis point increase in interest rates or a 10% decline in equity prices.Fair Value MeasurementsWe report certain assets and liabilities at fair value; specifically, separate account assets, derivatives, embedded derivatives and most investments and cash equivalents. Fair value assumes the exchange of assets or liabilities occurs in orderly transactions and is not the result of a forced liquidation or distressed sale. We include actual market prices, or observable inputs, in our fair value measurements to the extent available. Broker quotes are obtained when quotes from pricing services are not available. We validate prices obtained from third parties through a variety of means such as: price variance analysis, subsequent sales testing, stale price review, price comparison across pricing vendors and due diligence reviews of vendors. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our fair value measurements.Fair Value of Liabilities and Nonperformance RiskCompanies are required to measure the fair value of liabilities at the price that would be received to transfer the liability to a market participant (an exit price). Since there is not a market for our obligations of our variable annuity riders, indexed annuities and indexed universal life insurance, we consider the assumptions participants in a hypothetical market would make to reflect an exit price. As a result, we adjust the valuation of variable annuity riders, indexed annuities and indexed universal life insurance by updating certain contractholder assumptions, adding explicit margins to provide for profit, risk and expenses, and adjusting the rates used to discount expected cash flows to reflect a current market estimate of our nonperformance risk. The nonperformance risk adjustment is based on observable market data adjusted to estimate the risk of our life insurance company subsidiaries not fulfilling these liabilities. Consistent with general market conditions, this estimate resulted in a spread over the LIBOR swap curve as of March 31, 2018. As our estimate of this spread widens or tightens, the liability will decrease or increase. If this nonperformance credit spread moves to a zero spread over the LIBOR swap curve, the reduction to future net income would be approximately $295 million, net of DAC, DSIC, unearned revenue amortization, the reinsurance accrual and income taxes (calculated at the statutory tax rate of 21%), based on March 31, 2018 credit spreads.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesOverviewWe maintained substantial liquidity during the three months ended March 31, 2018. At March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, we had $2.1 billion and $2.5 billion, respectively, in cash and cash equivalents excluding CIEs. We have additional liquidity available through an unsecured revolving credit facility for up to $750 million that expires in October 2022. Under the terms of the credit agreement, we can increase this facility to $1 billion upon satisfaction of certain approval requirements. Available borrowings under this facility are reduced by any outstanding letters of credit. At March 31, 2018, we had no outstanding borrowings under this credit facility and had $1 million of outstanding letters of credit. Our credit facility contains various administrative, reporting, legal and financial covenants. We were in compliance with all such covenants at March 31, 2018. We enter into short-term borrowings, which may include repurchase agreements and Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) advances, to reduce reinvestment risk. Short-term borrowings allow us to receive cash to reinvest in longer-duration assets, while paying back the short-term debt with cash flows generated by the fixed income portfolio. The balance of repurchase agreements as of both 67AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 was $50 million, which is collateralized with agency residential mortgage backed securities and commercial mortgage backed securities from our investment portfolio. Our subsidiary, RiverSource Life Insurance Company (“RiverSource Life”), is a member of the FHLB of Des Moines, which provides access to collateralized borrowings. We had $151 million and $150 million of borrowings from the FHLB, which is collateralized with commercial mortgage backed securities, as of March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. We believe cash flows from operating activities, available cash balances and our availability of revolver borrowings will be sufficient to fund our operating liquidity needs.Dividends from SubsidiariesAmeriprise Financial is primarily a parent holding company for the operations carried out by our wholly owned subsidiaries. Because of our holding company structure, our ability to meet our cash requirements, including the payment of dividends on our common stock, substantially depends upon the receipt of dividends or return of capital from our subsidiaries, particularly our life insurance subsidiary, RiverSource Life, our face-amount certificate subsidiary, Ameriprise Certificate Company (“ACC”), AMPF Holding Corporation, which is the parent company of our retail introducing broker-dealer subsidiary, Ameriprise Financial Services, Inc. (“AFSI”) and our clearing broker-dealer subsidiary, American Enterprise Investment Services, Inc. (“AEIS”), our Auto and Home insurance subsidiary, IDS Property Casualty Insurance Company (“IDS Property Casualty”), doing business as Ameriprise Auto & Home Insurance, our transfer agent subsidiary, Columbia Management Investment Services Corp., our investment advisory company, Columbia Management Investment Advisers, LLC, and Ameriprise International Holdings GmbH, which is the parent company of Threadneedle Asset Management Holdings Sàrl. The payment of dividends by many of our subsidiaries is restricted and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to regulatory capital requirements.Actual capital and regulatory capital requirements for our wholly owned subsidiaries subject to regulatory capital requirements were as follows:  Actual Capital Regulatory Capital RequirementsMarch 31, 2018 December 31, 2017March 31, 2018 December 31, 2017(in millions)RiverSource Life (1)(2)$2,934 $2,451 N/A $562RiverSource Life of NY (1)(2)290 269 N/A 36IDS Property Casualty (1)(3)787 781 $224 214Ameriprise Insurance Company (1)(3)49 48 3 3ACC(4)(5)379 365 351 343Threadneedle Asset Management Holdings Sàrl (6)557 426 177 170Ameriprise National Trust Bank (7)23 22 10 10AFSI (3)(4)145 63 # #Ameriprise Captive Insurance Company (3)52 51 13 8Ameriprise Trust Company (3)31 31 27 27AEIS (3)(4)128 125 23 22RiverSource Distributors, Inc.

The regulatory capital requirements at March 31, 2018 represent calculations at December 31, 2017 of the rule based requirements, as specified by FCA regulations.(7) Ameriprise National Trust Bank is required to maintain capital in compliance with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency regulations and policies.In addition to the particular regulations restricting dividend payments and establishing subsidiary capitalization requirements, we take into account the overall health of the business, capital levels and risk management considerations in determining a dividend strategy for payments to our parent holding company from our subsidiaries, and in deciding to use cash to make capital contributions to our subsidiaries.During the three months ended March 31, 2018, the parent holding company received cash dividends or a return of capital from its 68AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. subsidiaries of $484 million (including $200 million from RiverSource Life) and contributed no cash to its subsidiaries. During the three months ended March 31, 2017, the parent holding company received cash dividends or a return of capital from its subsidiaries of $458 million (including $300 million from RiverSource Life) and contributed cash to its subsidiaries of $25 million.In 2009, RiverSource established an agreement to protect its exposure to Genworth Life Insurance Company (“GLIC”) for its reinsured LTC. In 2016, substantial enhancements to this reinsurance protection agreement were finalized. The terms of these confidential provisions within the agreement have been shared, in the normal course of regular reviews, with our domiciliary regulator and rating agencies. Management believes that this agreement and offsetting non LTC legacy arrangements with Genworth will enable RiverSource to recover on all net exposure in the event of an insolvency of GLIC.Dividends Paid to Shareholders and Share Repurchases We paid regular quarterly dividends to our shareholders totaling $125 million and $121 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. On April 23, 2018, we announced a quarterly dividend of $0.90 per common share. The dividend will be paid on May 18, 2018 to our shareholders of record at the close of business on May 7, 2018.In April 2017, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase up to $2.5 billion of our common stock through June 30, 2019. As of March 31, 2018, we had $1.7 billion remaining under this share repurchase authorization. We intend to fund share repurchases through existing working capital, future earnings and other customary financing methods. The share repurchase program does not require the purchase of any minimum number of shares, and depending on market conditions and other factors, these purchases may be commenced or suspended at any time without prior notice. Acquisitions under the share repurchase program may be made in the open market, through privately negotiated transactions or block trades or other means. During the three months ended March 31, 2018, we repurchased a total of 2.4 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $159.57 per share.Cash Flows Cash flows of CIEs and restricted and segregated cash are reflected in our cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities, investing activities and financing activities. Cash held by CIEs is not available for general use by Ameriprise Financial, nor is Ameriprise Financial cash available for general use by its CIEs. Cash segregated under federal and other regulations is held for the exclusive benefit of our brokerage customers and is not available for general use by Ameriprise Financial.Operating ActivitiesNet cash used in operating activities was $208 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $6 million for the prior year period primarily due to a $284 million decrease in cash from changes in brokerage deposits.Investing ActivitiesOur investing activities primarily relate to our Available-for-Sale investment portfolio. Further, this activity is significantly affected by the net flows of our investment certificate, fixed annuity and universal life products reflected in financing activities.Net cash provided by investing activities decreased $124 million to $87 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $211 million for the prior year period primarily due to a $321 million increase in cash used for purchases of Available-for-Sale securities, a $79 million decrease in proceeds from maturities, sinking fund payments and calls of Available-for-Sale securities and a $61 million decrease in proceeds from sales and collections of other investments, partially offset by a $315 million increase in proceeds from sales of Available-for-Sale securities.Financing ActivitiesNet cash used in financing activities increased $130 million to $564 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $434 million for the prior year period due to a $57 million decrease in net cash inflows related to investment certificates, a $58 million decrease in deposits and other additions related to policyholder account balances and a $52 million increase in repayments of debt by CIEs.Contractual CommitmentsThere have been no material changes to our contractual obligations disclosed in our 2017 10-K. Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe provide asset management services to investment entities which are considered to be VIEs, such as CLOs, hedge funds, property funds and private equity funds, which are sponsored by us. We consolidate certain CLOs. We have determined that consolidation is not required for hedge funds, property funds and private equity funds, which are sponsored by us. Our maximum exposure to loss with respect to our investment in these non-consolidated entities is limited to our carrying value.
