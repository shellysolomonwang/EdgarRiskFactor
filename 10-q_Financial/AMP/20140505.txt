Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2013 10-K and other factors as discussed herein.Equity price, credit market and interest rate fluctuations can have a significant impact on our results of operations, primarily due to the effects they have on the asset management and other asset-based fees we earn, the “spread” income generated on our fixed annuities, fixed insurance, deposit products and the fixed portion of variable annuities and variable insurance contracts, the value of deferred acquisition costs (“DAC”) and deferred sales inducement costs (“DSIC”) assets, the values of liabilities for guaranteed benefits associated with our variable annuities and the values of derivatives held to hedge these benefits.Earnings, as well as operating earnings, will continue to be negatively impacted by the ongoing low interest rate environment. In addition to continuing spread compression in our interest sensitive product lines, a sustained low interest rate environment may result in increases to our reserves and changes in various rate assumptions we use to amortize DAC and DSIC, which may negatively impact our operating earnings. For additional discussion on our interest rate risk, see Item 3. “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.”We consolidate certain collateralized debt obligations (“CDOs”) and other investment products (collectively, “investment entities”) for which we provide asset management services to and sponsor for the investment of client assets in the normal course of business. These entities are defined as consolidated investment entities (“CIEs”). For further information on CIEs, see Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Changes in the valuation of the CIE assets and liabilities impact pretax income. The net income (loss) of the CIEs is reflected in net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests. The results of operations of the CIEs are reflected in the Corporate & Other segment. On a consolidated basis, the management fees we earn for the services we provide to the CIEs and the related general and administrative expenses are eliminated and the changes in the assets and liabilities related to the CIEs, primarily debt and underlying syndicated loans, are reflected in net investment income. We continue to include the fees in the management and financial advice fees line within our Asset Management segment.While our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), management believes that operating measures, which exclude net realized gains or losses; the market impact on variable 51AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. annuity guaranteed benefits, net of hedges and the related DSIC and DAC amortization; the market impact on indexed universal life benefits, net of hedges and the related DAC amortization, unearned revenue amortization and the reinsurance accrual; restructuring charges; income (loss) from discontinued operations; and the impact of consolidating CIEs, best reflect the underlying performance of our core operations and facilitate a more meaningful trend analysis. While the consolidation of the CIEs impacts our balance sheet and income statement, our exposure to these entities is unchanged and there is no impact to the underlying business results. Management uses certain of these non-GAAP measures to evaluate our financial performance on a basis comparable to that used by some securities analysts and investors. Also, certain of these non-GAAP measures are taken into consideration, to varying degrees, for purposes of business planning and analysis and for certain compensation-related matters. Throughout our Management’s Discussion and Analysis, these non-GAAP measures are referred to as operating measures.It is management’s priority to increase shareholder value over a multi-year horizon by achieving our on-average, over-time financial targets.Our financial targets are:•Operating total net revenue growth of 6% to 8%,•Operating earnings per diluted share growth of 12% to 15%, and•Operating return on equity excluding accumulated other comprehensive income of 15% to 18%.The following tables reconcile our GAAP measures to operating measures: Three Months Ended March 31, 2014 2013 (in millions)Total net revenues$2,996 $2,691Less: Revenue attributable to CIEs177 82Less: Net realized gains5 1Less: Market impact on indexed universal life benefits2 —Operating total net revenues$2,812 $2,608     Per Diluted Share Three Months Ended March 31, Three Months Ended March 31, 2014 2013 2014 2013 (in millions, except per share amounts)Net income$515 $365    Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests115 30    Net income attributable to Ameriprise Financial400 335 $2.01 $1.58Less: Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax(1) (1) — —Net income from continuing operations attributable to Ameriprise Financial401 336 2.01 1.58Add: Restructuring charges, net of tax (1)— 1 — —Add: Market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits, net of tax (1)10 2 0.05 0.01Add: Market impact on indexed universal life benefits, net of tax (1)(1) — — —Less: Net realized gains (losses), net of tax (1)3 1 0.02 —Operating earnings$407 $338 $2.04 $1.59        Weighted average common shares outstanding:       Basic195.5 208.4    Diluted199.1 212.3    (1) Calculated using the statutory tax rate of 35%.52AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC.

Certain of our accounting and reporting policies are critical to an understanding of our consolidated results of operations and financial condition and, in some cases, the application of these policies can be significantly affected by the estimates, judgments and assumptions made by management during the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements. These accounting policies are discussed in detail in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis — Critical Accounting Policies” in our 2013 10-K.Recent Accounting PronouncementsFor information regarding recent accounting pronouncements and their expected impact on our future consolidated results of operations and financial condition, see Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. 53AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. Assets Under Management and AdministrationAssets under management (“AUM”) include external client assets for which we provide investment management services, such as the assets of the Columbia funds and Threadneedle funds, assets of institutional clients and assets of clients in our advisor platform held in wrap accounts as well as assets managed by sub-advisers selected by us. AUM also includes certain assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets for which we provide investment management services and recognize management fees in our Asset Management segment, such as the assets of the general account and the variable product funds held in the separate accounts of our life insurance subsidiaries and client assets of CIEs. These assets do not include assets under advisement, for which we provide model portfolios but do not have full discretionary investment authority. Corporate & Other AUM primarily includes former bank assets that are managed within our Corporate & Other segment.Assets under administration (“AUA”) include assets for which we provide administrative services such as client assets invested in other companies’ products that we offer outside of our wrap accounts. These assets include those held in clients’ brokerage accounts. We generally record revenues received from administered assets as distribution fees. We do not exercise management discretion over these assets and do not earn a management fee. These assets are not reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. AUA also includes certain assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets for which we do not provide investment management services and do not recognize management fees, such as investments in non-affiliated funds held in the separate accounts of our life insurance subsidiaries. These assets do not include assets under advisement, for which we provide model portfolios but do not have full discretionary investment authority.The following table presents detail regarding our AUM and AUA: March 31,   2014 2013 Change (in billions)  Assets Under Management and Administration       Advice & Wealth Management AUM$159.8 $134.2 $25.6 19 %Asset Management AUM503.9 466.5 37.4 8Corporate & Other AUM0.9 1.0 (0.1) (10)Eliminations(20.5) (19.1) (1.4) (7)Total Assets Under Management644.1 582.6 61.5 11Total Assets Under Administration138.7 125.1 13.6 11Total AUM and AUA$782.8 $707.7 $75.1 11 %Total AUM increased $61.5 billion, or 11%, to $644.1 billion as of March 31, 2014 compared to $582.6 billion as of March 31, 2013 due to a $25.6 billion increase in Advice & Wealth Management AUM driven by wrap account net inflows and market appreciation and a $37.4 billion increase in Asset Management AUM driven by market appreciation, partially offset by net outflows.

Consolidated Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended March 31, 2014 and 2013 The following table presents our consolidated results of operations: Three Months Ended March 31,   2014 2013 Change (in millions)  Revenues       Management and financial advice fees$1,386 $1,244 $142 11 %Distribution fees476 434 42 10Net investment income471 489 (18) (4)Premiums330 310 20 6Other revenues340 222 118 53Total revenues3,003 2,699 304 11Banking and deposit interest expense7 8 (1) (13)Total net revenues2,996 2,691 305 11Expenses       Distribution expenses786 698 88 13Interest credited to fixed accounts186 198 (12) (6)Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses450 409 41 10Amortization of deferred acquisition costs87 75 12 16Interest and debt expense79 66 13 20General and administrative expense758 758 — —Total expenses2,346 2,204 142 6Income from continuing operations before income tax provision650 487 163 33Income tax provision134 121 13 11Income from continuing operations516 366 150 41Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax(1) (1) — NMNet income515 365 150 41Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests115 30 85 NMNet income attributable to Ameriprise Financial$400 $335 $65 19 %NM Not Meaningful.OverallIncome from continuing operations before income tax provision increased $163 million, or 33%, to $650 million for the three months ended March 31, 2014 compared to $487 million for the prior year period primarily reflecting the impact of market appreciation, wrap account net inflows, a $27 million benefit from policyholder movement of investments in Portfolio Navigator funds under certain in-force variable annuities with living benefit guarantees to the managed volatility funds and an increase in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, partially offset by the negative impact from spread compression in our interest sensitive product lines, the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits (net of hedges and the related DSIC and DAC amortization), approximately $20 million in higher weather-related losses in the first quarter of 2014, a $30 million increase in auto liability reserves in the first quarter of 2014 and asset management net outflows. The market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits (net of hedges and the related DSIC and DAC amortization) was an expense of $15 million for the first quarter of 2014, which included a $2 million expense associated with policyholder movement of investments in Portfolio Navigator funds under certain in-force variable annuities with living benefit guarantees to the managed volatility funds, compared to an expense of $2 million for the prior year period. The negative impact on earnings from spread compression in our interest sensitive product lines was approximately $18 million pretax for the three months ended March 31, 2014 compared to the prior year period.     Net RevenuesNet revenues increased $305 million, or 11%, to $3.0 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2014 compared to $2.7 billion for the prior year period primarily due to higher management and financial advice fees, distribution fees and other revenues.55AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. Management and financial advice fees increased $142 million, or 11%, to $1.4 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2014 compared to $1.2 billion for the prior year period primarily due to higher asset-based fees driven by an increase in average AUM. Average AUM increased $64.3 billion, or 11%, compared to the prior year period primarily due to market appreciation and wrap account net inflows, partially offset by asset management net outflows. See our discussion on the changes in AUM in our segment results of operations section below. Distribution fees increased $42 million, or 10%, to $476 million for the three months ended March 31, 2014 compared to $434 million for the prior year period due to higher client assets and increased client activity.Other revenues increased $118 million, or 53%, to $340 million for the three months ended March 31, 2014 compared to $222 million for the prior year period due to a $100 million increase in other revenues of CIEs and higher fees from variable annuity guarantees driven by higher volumes due to prior year sales with a first fee collected on the anniversary date, as well as higher fee rates. ExpensesTotal expenses increased $142 million, or 6%, to $2.3 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2014 compared to $2.2 billion for the prior year period primarily due to increases in distribution expenses and benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses.Distribution expenses increased $88 million, or 13%, to $786 million for the three months ended March 31, 2014 compared to $698 million for the prior year period driven by growth in assets under management. See our discussion on the changes in AUM in our segment results of operations section below.Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses increased $41 million, or 10%, to $450 million for the three months ended March 31, 2014 compared to $409 million for the prior year period primarily reflecting the following items:•An increase in expenses related to our auto and home business driven by higher claim and claim adjustment expense reflecting the impact of growth in exposures due to a 14% increase in gross new policies, approximately $20 million of expense in the first quarter of 2014 for weather-related losses from severe winter weather and a $30 million increase in auto liability reserves in the first quarter of 2014 based upon additional analysis and information regarding continued adverse development of bodily injury claims associated with prior accident years. •An increase in expenses of approximately $9 million related to higher reserve funding driven by the impact of higher fees from prior year sales with variable annuity guarantees.•A $32 million decrease in expenses from policyholder movement of investments in Portfolio Navigator funds under certain in-force variable annuities with living benefit guarantees to the managed volatility funds, which included a $2 million expense related to the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits. See additional discussion in the Annuities segment.•A $109 million decrease in expense compared to the prior year period from the unhedged nonperformance credit spread risk adjustment on variable annuity guaranteed benefits.•A $123 million increase in expense from other market impacts on variable annuity guaranteed benefits, net of hedges in place to offset those risks and the related DSIC amortization. The $123 million increase was the result of an unfavorable $805 million change in the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits reserves, a favorable $681 million change in the market impact on derivatives hedging the variable annuity guaranteed benefits and a favorable $1 million DSIC offset. The main market drivers contributing to these changes are summarized below:•Interest rates were down in 2014 and up in 2013 resulting in an unfavorable change in the variable annuity guaranteed living benefits liability, partially offset by a favorable change in the related hedge assets. •Equity market and volatility impacts on the hedge assets resulted in lower expenses in 2014 compared to 2013. This benefit was partially offset by an unfavorable change in 2014 compared to 2013 from equity market and volatility impacts on the corresponding variable annuity guaranteed living benefits liability. •Other unhedged items, including the difference between the assumed and actual underlying separate account investment performance, fixed income credit exposures, transaction costs and various behavioral items, were a net favorable impact compared to the prior year period.Amortization of DAC increased $12 million, or 16%, to $87 million for the three months ended March 31, 2014 compared to $75 million for the prior year period due to the market impact on DAC and a $5 million expense related to the DAC offset to the benefit from policyholder movement of investments in Portfolio Navigator funds under certain in-force variable annuities with living benefit guarantees to the managed volatility funds. The market impact on DAC was a benefit of $6 million for the first quarter of 2014 compared to a benefit of $12 million for the prior year period as a result of less favorable equity market returns partially offset by more favorable bond fund returns compared to the prior year period.56AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. Interest and debt expense increased $13 million, or 20%, to $79 million for the three months ended March 31, 2014 compared to $66 million for the prior year period primarily due to a $9 million increase in interest and debt expense of CIEs, as well as higher average outstanding debt balances.Income TaxesOur effective tax rate on income from continuing operations including income attributable to noncontrolling interests was 20.7% for the three months ended March 31, 2014 compared to 25.0% for the prior year period. The decrease in the effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2014 compared to the prior year period is primarily the result of a $17 million benefit related to the completion of an Internal Revenue Service audit. Our effective tax rate on income from continuing operations excluding income attributable to noncontrolling interests was 25.1% for the three months ended March 31, 2014 compared to 26.6% for the prior year period. The effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2014 was lower than the statutory rate as a result of tax preferred items including the dividends received deduction and low income housing tax credits, as well as the audit benefit. Results of Operations by Segment for the Three Months Ended March 31, 2014 and 2013 Operating earnings is the measure of segment profit or loss management uses to evaluate segment performance. Operating earnings should not be viewed as a substitute for GAAP income from continuing operations before income tax provision. We believe the presentation of segment operating earnings as we measure it for management purposes enhances the understanding of our business by reflecting the underlying performance of our core operations and facilitating a more meaningful trend analysis. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the presentation of segment results and our definition of operating earnings.The following table presents summary financial information by segment: Three Months Ended March 31, 2014 2013 (in millions)Advice & Wealth Management   Net revenues$1,149 $1,018Expenses968 888Operating earnings$181 $130Asset Management   Net revenues$807 $746Expenses624 608Operating earnings$183 $138Annuities   Net revenues$636 $624Expenses460 482Operating earnings$176 $142Protection   Net revenues$555 $537Expenses496 434Operating earnings$59 $103Corporate & Other   Net revenues$6 $4Expenses61 57Operating loss$(55) $(53)57AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. Advice & Wealth ManagementOur Advice & Wealth Management segment provides financial planning and advice, as well as full-service brokerage services, primarily to retail clients through our advisors. These services are centered on long-term, personal relationships between our advisors and our clients and focus on helping clients confidently achieve their financial goals. Our advisors provide a distinctive approach to financial planning and have access to a broad selection of both affiliated and non-affiliated products to help clients meet their financial needs. A significant portion of revenues in this segment is fee-based, driven by the level of client assets, which is impacted by both market movements and net asset flows. We also earn net investment income on invested assets primarily from certificate products. This segment earns revenues (distribution fees) for distributing non-affiliated products and intersegment revenues (distribution fees) for distributing our affiliated products and services to our retail clients. Intersegment expenses for this segment include expenses for investment management services provided by the Asset Management segment.In addition to purchases of affiliated and non-affiliated mutual funds and other securities on a stand-alone basis, clients may purchase mutual funds, among other securities, in connection with investment advisory fee-based “wrap account” programs or services, and pay fees based on a percentage of their assets.The following table presents the changes in wrap account assets and average balances for the three months ended March 31: 2014 2013 (in billions)Beginning balance$153.5 $124.6Net flows4.2 4.1Market appreciation and other1.7 5.1Ending balance$159.4 $133.8    Average balance (1)$155.7 $129.4(1) Average ending balances are calculated using an average of the prior period’s ending balance and all months in the current period.Wrap account assets increased $5.9 billion, or 4%, during the three months ended March 31, 2014 due to net inflows of $4.2 billion and market appreciation and other of $1.7 billion.

The negative impact of lower spreads on cash sweep accounts and certificates was approximately $8 million compared to the prior year period. We expect there will continue to be earnings pressure from low short-term interest rates during the balance of the year. Pretax operating margin was 15.8% for the three months ended March 31, 2014 compared to 12.8% for the prior year period.Net RevenuesNet revenues exclude net realized gains or losses. Net revenues increased $131 million, or 13%, to $1.1 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2014 compared to $1.0 billion for the prior year period reflecting retail client net inflows, market appreciation and increased client activity, partially offset by the negative impact of low interest rates. Operating net revenue per branded advisor was $118,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2014, up 13% from the prior year period driven by the combination of asset growth and strong client activity. Total branded advisors were 9,704 at March 31, 2014 compared to 9,777 at March 31, 2013.Management and financial advice fees increased $79 million, or 17%, to $555 million for the three months ended March 31, 2014 compared to $476 million for the prior year period driven by growth in wrap account assets. Average wrap account assets increased $26.3 billion, or 20%, compared to the prior year period due to net inflows and market appreciation. See our discussion of the changes in wrap account assets above.Distribution fees increased $44 million, or 9%, to $547 million for the three months ended March 31, 2014 compared to $503 million for the prior year period primarily due to higher client assets and increased client activity.ExpensesTotal expenses increased $80 million, or 9%, to $968 million for the three months ended March 31, 2014 compared to $888 million for the prior year period due to an $81 million increase in distribution expenses driven by higher compensation due to growth in client assets and increased client activity.59AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. Asset ManagementOur Asset Management segment provides investment advice and investment products to retail, high net worth and institutional clients on a global scale through Columbia Management and Threadneedle. Columbia Management primarily provides products and services in the U.S. and Threadneedle primarily provides products and services internationally. We provide clients with U.S. domestic individual products through unaffiliated third party financial institutions and through our Advice & Wealth Management segment, and we provide institutional products and services through our institutional sales force. International retail products are primarily distributed through third-party financial institutions and unaffiliated financial advisors. Individual products include U.S. mutual funds and non-U.S. equivalents, exchange-traded funds and variable product funds underlying insurance and annuity separate accounts. Institutional asset management services are designed to meet specific client objectives and may involve a range of products, including those that focus on traditional asset classes, separately managed accounts, individually managed accounts, collateralized loan obligations, hedge funds, collective funds and property funds. Collateralized loan obligations, hedge funds and certain private funds are often classified as alternative assets. Revenues in this segment are primarily earned as fees based on managed asset balances, which are impacted by market movements, net asset flows, asset allocation and product mix. We may also earn performance fees from certain accounts where investment performance meets or exceeds certain pre-identified targets. Our Asset Management segment also provides intercompany asset management services for Ameriprise Financial subsidiaries. The fees for such services are reflected within the Asset Management segment results through intersegment transfer pricing. Intersegment expenses for this segment include distribution expenses for services provided by our Advice & Wealth Management, Annuities and Protection segments.From time to time, fee waivers have been provided to the Columbia Money Market Funds (the “Funds”) by Columbia Management and certain other subsidiaries performing services for the Funds for the purposes of reducing the expenses charged to a Fund in a given period to maintain or improve a Fund’s net yield in that period. Our subsidiaries may enter into contractual arrangements with the Funds identifying the specific fees to be waived and/or expenses to be reimbursed, as well as the time period for which such waivers will apply. In aggregate, we voluntarily waived fees of $3 million for both the three months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013.60AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC.

Total segment AUM net outflows were $3.9 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2014. Management expects, consistent with prior patterns of outflows, that outflows of primarily low margin assets directly or indirectly affiliated with Threadneedle and Columbia former parent companies will continue for the foreseeable future. The overall impact to segment results is difficult to quantify due to uncertain timing, volume and mix of the outflows. Columbia managed assets increased $1.2 billion during the three months ended March 31, 2014 primarily due to market appreciation, partially offset by net outflows. Total Columbia net outflows were $2.7 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2014. Columbia retail funds were essentially flat compared to December 31, 2013 as market appreciation was offset by net outflows and distributions. Columbia retail net outflows of $2.6 billion during the first quarter of 2014 included $0.4 billion of outflows from a former parent affiliated distribution relationship and $1.0 billion of outflows in the defined contribution/investment only channel that reflected poor performance in a few funds where changes have been made to improve results. Columbia institutional AUM increased $0.8 billion, or 1%, during the three months ended March 31, 2014 due to market appreciation, partially offset by net 65AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. outflows of $0.4 billion related to former parent affiliated distribution. Columbia alternative AUM increased $0.4 billion, or 7%, during the first quarter of 2014 primarily due to net inflows from launching a new CDO.Threadneedle managed assets increased $1.9 billion, or 1%, during the three months ended March 31, 2014 due to market appreciation and a positive impact of foreign currency translation, partially offset by net outflows. Threadneedle retail funds were essentially flat compared to December 31, 2013 as market appreciation and a positive impact of foreign currency translation were offset by net outflows. At Threadneedle, strong retail net inflows were offset by approximately $2.1 billion of outflows related to the departure of members of the U.S. Equities team, resulting in retail net outflows of $0.9 billion for the first quarter of 2014. Following the departures, Threadneedle has been investing in its London-based team and increasing its collaboration with Columbia Management’s U.S. Equities teams, to bring clients the benefit of a fully resourced team that leverages the intellectual capital of both organizations. The outflows associated with the departures were in line with management’s expectations and we may experience some related outflows this year. Excluding the impact of the departures, Threadneedle retail net inflows were $1.2 billion in the quarter, with particular strength in U.K. and Global equity products. In addition, in April Threadneedle won a $5.5 billion retail mandate to manage assets in a Strategic Managed fund, which holds a combination of global and U.K. domestic equities and bonds. We expect it to fund in the second quarter of 2014. Threadneedle institutional AUM increased $1.7 billion, or 2%, during the three months ended March 31, 2014 primarily due to market appreciation and a positive impact of foreign currency translation, partially offset by net outflows. Threadneedle institutional net outflows of $0.3 billion during the first quarter of 2014 primarily reflected $1.0 billion of outflows from legacy insurance assets, partially offset by funding of new mandates and additional flows into existing funds.

Net RevenuesNet revenues, which exclude net realized gains or losses, increased $61 million, or 8%, to $807 million for the three months ended March 31, 2014 compared to $746 million for the prior year period driven by an increase in management and financial advice fees.Management and financial advice fees increased $53 million, or 8%, to $680 million for the three months ended March 31, 2014 compared to $627 million for the prior year period primarily due to an increase in assets under management. Average assets under management increased 9% compared to the prior year period driven by equity market appreciation, partially offset by net outflows. See our discussion above on the changes in assets under management.66AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. ExpensesTotal expenses increased $16 million, or 3%, to $624 million for the three months ended March 31, 2014 compared to $608 million for the prior year period due to a $16 million increase in distribution expenses driven by higher retail fund assets.  AnnuitiesOur Annuities segment provides variable and fixed annuity products of RiverSource Life companies to individual clients. We provide our variable annuity products through our advisors, and our fixed annuity products are distributed through both affiliated and unaffiliated advisors and financial institutions. Revenues for our variable annuity products are primarily earned as fees based on underlying account balances, which are impacted by both market movements and net asset flows. Revenues for our fixed annuity products are primarily earned as net investment income on assets supporting fixed account balances, with profitability significantly impacted by the spread between net investment income earned and interest credited on the fixed account balances. We also earn net investment income on owned assets supporting reserves for immediate annuities and for certain guaranteed benefits offered with variable annuities and on capital supporting the business. Intersegment revenues for this segment reflect fees paid by our Asset Management segment for marketing support and other services provided in connection with the availability of variable insurance trust funds (“VIT Funds”) under the variable annuity contracts. Intersegment expenses for this segment include distribution expenses for services provided by our Advice & Wealth Management segment, as well as expenses for investment management services provided by our Asset Management segment.The following table presents the results of operations of our Annuities segment on an operating basis: Three Months Ended March 31,     2014 2013 Change (in millions)  Revenues       Management and financial advice fees$183 $170 $13 8 %Distribution fees88 81 7 9Net investment income242 264 (22) (8)Premiums26 28 (2) (7)Other revenues97 81 16 20Total revenues636 624 12 2Banking and deposit interest expense— — — —Total net revenues636 624 12 2Expenses       Distribution expenses107 97 10 10Interest credited to fixed accounts148 164 (16) (10)Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses86 116 (30) (26)Amortization of deferred acquisition costs54 41 13 32Interest and debt expense10 8 2 25General and administrative expense55 56 (1) (2)Total expenses460 482 (22) (5)Operating earnings$176 $142 $34 24 %Our Annuities segment pretax operating income, which excludes net realized gains or losses and the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits (net of hedges and the related DSIC and DAC amortization), increased $34 million, or 24%, to $176 million for the three months ended March 31, 2014 compared to $142 million for the prior year period due to a benefit from policyholder movement of investments in Portfolio Navigator funds under certain in-force variable annuities with living benefit guarantees to the managed volatility funds and equity market appreciation, partially offset by fixed annuity spread compression.During the fourth quarter of 2013, we added managed volatility fund options for our in-force variable annuities with living benefit guarantees. These additional investment options continue to be well received by existing policyholders with $1.8 billion of asset movement into the funds in the first quarter of 2014. The resulting earnings benefit in the first quarter of 2014 was $29 million.RiverSource variable annuity account balances increased 7% to $75.9 billion at March 31, 2014 compared to the prior year period due to equity market appreciation, partially offset by net outflows of $964 million. RiverSource fixed annuity account balances 67AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. declined 5% to $12.9 billion at March 31, 2014 compared to the prior year period reflecting elevated surrenders on products sold through third parties where rates have been reset. This decline is offset by the change in crediting rates, which decreased the level of spread compression in the first quarter of 2014. Approximately $3.0 billion of the five-year guarantee block has been re-priced and approximately $1.1 billion will be re-priced in the balance of the year.Net RevenuesNet revenues, which exclude net realized gains or losses, increased $12 million, or 2%, to $636 million for the three months ended March 31, 2014 compared to $624 million for the prior year period primarily due to higher management and financial advice fees, distribution fees and other revenues, partially offset by a decrease in net investment income.Management and financial advice fees increased $13 million, or 8%, to $183 million for the three months ended March 31, 2014 compared to $170 million for the prior year period due to higher fees on variable annuities driven by higher separate account balances. Average variable annuities contract accumulation values increased $5.3 billion, or 8%, compared to the prior year period due to equity market appreciation, partially offset by net outflows.Distribution fees increased $7 million, or 9%, to $88 million for the three months ended March 31, 2014 compared to $81 million for the prior year period due to higher fees on variable annuities driven by higher separate account balances.Net investment income, which excludes net realized gains or losses, decreased $22 million, or 8%, to $242 million for the three months ended March 31, 2014 compared to $264 million for the prior year period primarily reflecting a decrease of approximately $6 million from lower invested assets due to fixed annuity net outflows and approximately $17 million from lower interest rates.Other revenues increased $16 million, or 20%, to $97 million for the three months ended March 31, 2014 compared to $81 million for the prior year period due to higher fees from variable annuity guarantees driven by higher volumes due to prior year sales with a first fee collected on the anniversary date, as well as higher fee rates.ExpensesTotal expenses, which exclude the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits (net of hedges and the related DSIC and DAC amortization) decreased $22 million, or 5%, to $460 million for the three months ended March 31, 2014 compared to $482 million for the prior year period. Distribution expenses increased $10 million, or 10%, to $107 million for the three months ended March 31, 2014 compared to $97 million for the prior year period primarily due to higher variable annuity compensation driven by higher variable annuity contract values.Interest credited to fixed accounts decreased $16 million, or 10%, to $148 million for the three months ended March 31, 2014 compared to $164 million for the prior year period driven by lower average fixed annuity account balances and lower crediting rates. Average fixed annuities contract accumulation values decreased $651 million, or 5%, to $13.1 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2014 compared to the prior year period due to net outflows. Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses, which exclude the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits (net of hedges and the related DSIC amortization), decreased $30 million, or 26%, to $86 million for the three months ended March 31, 2014 compared to $116 million for the prior year period primarily due to a $34 million benefit from policyholder movement of investments in Portfolio Navigator funds under certain in-force variable annuities with living benefit guarantees to the managed volatility funds, partially offset by an increase in expenses of approximately $9 million related to higher reserve funding driven by the impact of higher fees from prior year sales with variable annuity guarantees.Amortization of DAC, which excludes the DAC offset to the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits, increased $13 million, or 32%, to $54 million for the three months ended March 31, 2014 compared to $41 million for the prior year period primarily due to the market impact on DAC and a $5 million expense related to the DAC offset to the benefit from policyholder movement of investments in Portfolio Navigator funds under certain in-force variable annuities with living benefit guarantees to the managed volatility funds. The market impact on DAC was a benefit of $6 million for the first quarter of 2014 compared to a benefit of $11 million for the prior year period as a result of less favorable equity market returns partially offset by more favorable bond fund returns compared to the prior year period. 68AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. ProtectionOur Protection segment offers a variety of products to address the protection and risk management needs of our retail clients including life, disability income and property-casualty insurance. Life and disability income products are primarily provided through our advisors. Our property-casualty products are sold primarily through affinity relationships. We issue insurance policies through our life insurance subsidiaries and the Property Casualty companies. The primary sources of revenues for this segment are premiums, fees and charges we receive to assume insurance-related risk. We earn net investment income on owned assets supporting insurance reserves and capital supporting the business. We also receive fees based on the level of assets supporting variable universal life (“VUL”) separate account balances. This segment earns intersegment revenues from fees paid by our Asset Management segment for marketing support and other services provided in connection with the availability of VIT Funds under the VUL contracts. Intersegment expenses for this segment include distribution expenses for services provided by our Advice & Wealth Management segment, as well as expenses for investment management services provided by our Asset Management segment.The following table presents the results of operations of our Protection segment on an operating basis: Three Months Ended March 31,     2014 2013 Change (in millions)  Revenues       Management and financial advice fees$15 $14 $1 7 %Distribution fees23 22 1 5Net investment income108 110 (2) (2)Premiums308 286 22 8Other revenues101 105 (4) (4)Total revenues555 537 18 3Banking and deposit interest expense— — — —Total net revenues555 537 18 3Expenses       Distribution expenses14 13 1 8Interest credited to fixed accounts38 34 4 12Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses349 292 57 20Amortization of deferred acquisition costs28 29 (1) (3)Interest and debt expense7 6 1 17General and administrative expense60 60 — —Total expenses496 434 62 14Operating earnings$59 $103 $(44) (43)%Our Protection segment pretax operating income, which excludes net realized gains or losses and the market impact on indexed universal life benefits (net of hedges and the related DAC amortization, unearned revenue amortization and the reinsurance accrual), decreased $44 million, or 43%, to $59 million for the three months ended March 31, 2014 compared to $103 million for the prior year period reflecting lower auto and home earnings.Net RevenuesNet revenues, which exclude net realized gains or losses and the unearned revenue amortization and the reinsurance accrual offset to the market impact on indexed universal life benefits, increased $18 million, or 3%, to $555 million for the three months ended March 31, 2014 compared to $537 million for the prior year period due to growth in auto and home premiums.Premiums increased $22 million, or 8%, to $308 million for the three months ended March 31, 2014 compared to $286 million for the prior year period primarily due to growth in auto and home premiums driven by continued strong new policy sales growth across market segments, primarily from our affinity relationships with Costco and Progressive. Auto and home policy counts increased 11% year-over-year.69AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC.

The Corporate & Other segment also includes revenues and expenses of CIEs, which are excluded on an operating basis.The following table presents the results of operations of our Corporate & Other segment on an operating basis: Three Months Ended March 31,     2014 2013 Change (in millions)  Revenues       Distribution fees$1 $— $1 NMNet investment income4 1 3 NMOther revenues1 3 (2) (67)%Total revenues6 4 2 50Banking and deposit interest expense— — — —Total net revenues6 4 2 50Expenses       Distribution expenses— 1 (1) NMInterest and debt expense4 4 — —General and administrative expense57 52 5 10Total expenses61 57 4 7Operating loss$(55) $(53) $(2) (4)%NM Not Meaningful.Our Corporate & Other segment pretax operating loss excludes net realized gains or losses, the impact of consolidating CIEs and restructuring charges. Our Corporate & Other segment pretax operating loss was $55 million for the three months ended March 31, 2014 compared to $53 million for the prior year period. Market RiskOur primary market risk exposures are interest rate, equity price, foreign currency exchange rate and credit risk. Equity price and interest rate fluctuations can have a significant impact on our results of operations, primarily due to the effects they have on the asset management and other asset-based fees we earn, the spread income generated on our fixed annuities, fixed insurance, brokerage client cash balances, face amount certificate products and the fixed portion of our variable annuities and variable insurance contracts, the value of DAC and DSIC assets, the value of liabilities for guaranteed benefits associated with our variable annuities and the value of derivatives held to hedge these benefits.Our earnings from fixed annuities, fixed insurance, and the fixed portion of variable annuities and variable insurance contracts are based upon the spread between rates earned on assets held and the rates at which interest is credited to accounts. We primarily invest in fixed rate securities to fund the rate credited to clients. We guarantee an interest rate to the holders of these products. Investment assets and client liabilities generally differ as it relates to basis, repricing or maturity characteristics. Rates credited to clients’ accounts generally reset at shorter intervals than the yield on the underlying investments. Therefore, in an increasing interest rate 70AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. environment, higher interest rates may be reflected in crediting rates to clients sooner than in rates earned on invested assets, which could result in a reduced spread between the two rates, reduced earned income and a negative impact on pretax income. However, the current low interest rate environment is resulting in interest rates below the level of some of our liability guaranteed minimum interest rates (“GMIRs”). Hence, a modest rise in interest rates would not necessarily result in changes to all the liability credited rates while projected asset purchases would capture the full increase in interest rates. This dynamic would result in widening spreads under a modestly rising rate scenario given the current relationship between the current level of interest rates and the underlying GMIRs on the business. As a result of the low interest rate environment, our current reinvestment yields are generally lower than the current portfolio yield. We expect our portfolio income yields to continue to decline in future periods if interest rates remain low. The carrying value and weighted average yield of non-structured fixed maturity securities and commercial mortgage loans that may generate proceeds to reinvest through 2015 due to prepayment, maturity or call activity at the option of the issuer, excluding securities with a make-whole provision, was $3.4 billion and 3.9%, respectively, as of March 31, 2014. In addition, residential mortgage-backed securities, which are subject to prepayment risk as a result of the low interest rate environment, totaled $6.1 billion and had a weighted average yield of 3.4% as of March 31, 2014. While these amounts represent investments that could be subject to reinvestment risk, it is also possible that these investments will be used to fund liabilities or may not be prepaid and will remain invested at their current yields. In addition to the interest rate environment, the mix of benefit payments versus product sales as well as the timing and volumes associated with such mix may impact our investment yield. Furthermore, reinvestment activities and the associated investment yield may also be impacted by corporate strategies implemented at management discretion. The average yield for investment purchases during the three months ended March 31, 2014 was approximately 2.9%.The reinvestment of proceeds from maturities, calls and prepayments at rates below the current portfolio yield, which may be below the level of some liability guaranteed minimum interest rates, will have a negative impact to future operating results. To mitigate the unfavorable impact that the low interest rate environment has on our spread income, we assess reinvestment risk in our investment portfolio and monitor this risk in accordance with our asset/liability management framework. In addition, we may reduce the crediting rates on our fixed products when warranted, subject to guaranteed minimums. In the first quarter of 2014, we continued the process of setting lower renewal interest rates for a portion of our fixed annuities that are above the guaranteed minimum, which helps relieve some of the spread compression caused by low rates. Approximately $3.0 billion of the five-year guarantee block has been re-priced and approximately $1.1 billion will be re-priced in the balance of the year.The following table presents the account values of fixed annuities, fixed insurance, and the fixed portion of variable annuities and variable insurance contracts by range of guaranteed minimum crediting rates and the range of the difference between rates credited to contractholders as of March 31, 2014 and the respective guaranteed minimums, as well as the percentage of account values subject to rate reset in the time period indicated. Rates are reset at our discretion, subject to guaranteed minimums.

In addition to the fixed rate exposures noted above, RiverSource Life also has the following variable annuity guarantee benefits: guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits (“GMWB”), guaranteed minimum accumulation benefits (“GMAB”), guaranteed minimum death benefits (“GMDB”) and guaranteed minimum income benefits (“GMIB”). Each of these guaranteed benefits guarantees payouts to the annuity holder under certain specific conditions regardless of the performance of the underlying investment assets.The variable annuity guarantees continue to be managed by utilizing a hedging program which attempts to match the sensitivity of the assets with the sensitivity of the liabilities. This approach works with the premise that matched sensitivities will produce a highly effective hedging result. Our comprehensive hedging program focuses mainly on first order sensitivities of assets and liabilities: Equity Market Level (Delta), Interest Rate Level (Rho) and Volatility (Vega). Additionally, various second order sensitivities are managed. We use various index options across the term structure, interest rate swaps and swaptions, total return swaps and futures to manage the risk exposures. The exposures are measured and monitored daily, and adjustments to the hedge portfolio are made as necessary.In 2013, we established a macro hedge program which uses a combination of options and/or swaps to provide protection against the statutory tail scenario risk arising from variable annuity reserves on our statutory surplus. The program also covers some of the residual risks not covered by other hedging activities. We assess this residual risk under a range of scenarios in creating and executing the macro hedge program. The macro hedge program could result in additional earnings volatility as changes in the value of the macro hedge derivatives, which are designed to reduce statutory capital volatility, may not be closely aligned to changes in the variable annuity guaranty embedded derivatives.To evaluate interest rate and equity price risk we perform sensitivity testing which measures the impact on pretax income from the sources listed below for a 12-month period following a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates or a hypothetical 10% decline in equity prices. The interest rate risk test assumes a sudden 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve, with rates then staying at those levels for the next 12 months. The equity price risk test assumes a sudden 10% drop in equity prices, with equity prices then staying at those levels for the next 12 months. In estimating the values of variable annuity riders, equity indexed annuities, stock market certificates, indexed universal life insurance and the associated hedge assets, we assume no change in implied market volatility despite the 10% drop in equity prices.The following tables present our estimate of the impact on pretax income from the above defined hypothetical market movements as of March 31, 2014:  Equity Price Exposure to Pretax IncomeEquity Price Decline 10% Before Hedge Impact Hedge Impact Net Impact  (in millions)Asset-based management and distribution fees (1) $(258) $4 $(254)DAC and DSIC amortization (2) (3) (99) — (99)Variable annuity riders:      GMDB and GMIB (3) (84) — (84)GMWB (172) 148 (24)GMAB (35) 29 (6)DAC and DSIC amortization (4) N/A N/A 5Total variable annuity riders (291) 177 (109)Macro hedge program (5) — 20 20Equity indexed annuities 1 (1) —Certificates 2 (2) —Indexed universal life insurance 11 (12) (1)Total $(634) $186 $(443)72AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC.

This is a significantly more conservative estimate than if we assumed management follows its mean reversion guideline and increased near-term rates to recover the drop in equity values over a five-year period. We make this same conservative assumption in estimating the impact from GMDB and GMIB riders.(4) Market impact on DAC and DSIC amortization related to variable annuity riders is modeled net of hedge impact.(5) The market impact of the macro hedge program is modeled net of any related impact to DAC and DSIC amortization.The above results compare to an estimated negative net impact to pretax income of $389 million related to a 10% equity price decline and an estimated positive net impact to pretax income of $49 million related to a 100 basis point increase in interest rates as of December 31, 2013. Net impacts shown in the above table from GMWB and GMAB riders result largely from differences between the liability valuation basis and the hedging basis. Liabilities are valued using fair value accounting principles, with risk margins incorporated in contractholder behavior assumptions and with discount rates increased to reflect a current market estimate of our risk of nonperformance specific to these liabilities. The nonperformance spread risk is not hedged.Actual results could differ materially from those illustrated above as they are based on a number of estimates and assumptions. These include assuming that implied market volatility does not change when equity prices fall by 10%, that management does not increase assumed equity asset growth rates to anticipate recovery of the drop in equity values when valuing DAC, DSIC and GMDB and GMIB liability values and that the 100 basis point increase in interest rates is a parallel shift of the yield curve. Furthermore, we have not tried to anticipate changes in client preferences for different types of assets or other changes in client behavior, nor have we tried to anticipate actions management might take to increase revenues or reduce expenses in these scenarios.The selection of a 100 basis point interest rate increase as well as a 10% equity price decline should not be construed as a prediction of future market events. Impacts of larger or smaller changes in interest rates or equity prices may not be proportional to those shown for a 100 basis point increase in interest rates or a 10% decline in equity prices.Fair Value MeasurementsWe report certain assets and liabilities at fair value; specifically, separate account assets, derivatives, embedded derivatives, properties held by our consolidated property funds, and most investments and cash equivalents. Fair value assumes the exchange of assets or liabilities occurs in orderly transactions and is not the result of a forced liquidation or distressed sale. We include actual market prices, or observable inputs, in our fair value measurements to the extent available. Broker quotes are obtained when quotes from pricing services are not available. We validate prices obtained from third parties through a variety of means such as: price variance analysis, subsequent sales testing, stale price review, price comparison across pricing vendors and due diligence reviews of vendors. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our fair value measurements.73AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. Fair Value of Liabilities and Nonperformance RiskCompanies are required to measure the fair value of liabilities at the price that would be received to transfer the liability to a market participant (an exit price). Since there is not a market for our obligations of our variable annuity riders and indexed universal life insurance, we consider the assumptions participants in a hypothetical market would make to reflect an exit price. As a result, we adjust the valuation of variable annuity riders and indexed universal life insurance by updating certain contractholder assumptions, adding explicit margins to provide for profit, risk and expenses, and adjusting the rates used to discount expected cash flows to reflect a current market estimate of our nonperformance risk. The nonperformance risk adjustment is based on broker quotes for credit default swaps that are adjusted to estimate the risk of our life insurance company subsidiaries not fulfilling these liabilities. Consistent with general market conditions, this estimate resulted in a spread over the LIBOR swap curve as of March 31, 2014. As our estimate of this spread widens or tightens, the liability will decrease or increase. If this nonperformance credit spread moves to a zero spread over the LIBOR swap curve, the reduction to net income would be approximately $84 million, net of DAC, DSIC and unearned revenue amortization, the reinsurance accrual and income taxes (calculated at the statutory tax rate of 35%), based on March 31, 2014 credit spreads. Liquidity and Capital ResourcesOverviewWe maintained substantial liquidity during the three months ended March 31, 2014. At March 31, 2014, we had $2.4 billion in cash and cash equivalents compared to $2.6 billion at December 31, 2013. We have additional liquidity available through an unsecured revolving credit facility for up to $500 million that expires in September 2018. Under the terms of the underlying credit agreement, we can increase this facility to $750 million upon satisfaction of certain approval requirements. Available borrowings under this facility are reduced by any outstanding letters of credit. At March 31, 2014, we had no outstanding borrowings under this credit facility and had $2 million of outstanding letters of credit. Our junior subordinated notes due 2066 and credit facility contain various administrative, reporting, legal and financial covenants. We were in compliance with all such covenants at March 31, 2014.We enter into short-term borrowings, which may include repurchase agreements and Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) advances, to reduce reinvestment risk from higher levels of expected annuity net cash flows. Short-term borrowings allow us to receive cash to reinvest in longer-duration assets, while paying back the short-term debt with cash flows generated by the fixed income portfolio. The balance of repurchase agreements at both March 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013 was $50 million, which is collateralized with agency residential mortgage backed securities and commercial mortgage backed securities from our investment portfolio. Our subsidiary, RiverSource Life Insurance Company (“RiverSource Life”), is a member of the FHLB of Des Moines, which provides access to collateralized borrowings. As of March 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, we had $250 million and $450 million, respectively, of borrowings from the FHLB, which is collateralized with commercial mortgage backed securities. We believe cash flows from operating activities, available cash balances and our availability of revolver borrowings will be sufficient to fund our operating liquidity needs.Dividends from SubsidiariesAmeriprise Financial is primarily a parent holding company for the operations carried out by our wholly owned subsidiaries. Because of our holding company structure, our ability to meet our cash requirements, including the payment of dividends on our common stock, substantially depends upon the receipt of dividends or return of capital from our subsidiaries, particularly our life insurance subsidiary, RiverSource Life, our face-amount certificate subsidiary, Ameriprise Certificate Company (“ACC”), AMPF Holding Corporation, which is the parent company of our retail introducing broker-dealer subsidiary, Ameriprise Financial Services, Inc. (“AFSI”) and our clearing broker-dealer subsidiary, American Enterprise Investment Services, Inc. (“AEIS”), our Auto and Home insurance subsidiary, IDS Property Casualty Insurance Company (“IDS Property Casualty”), doing business as Ameriprise Auto & Home Insurance, our transfer agent subsidiary, Columbia Management Investment Services Corp., our investment advisory company, Columbia Management Investment Advisers, LLC, and Threadneedle. The payment of dividends by many of our subsidiaries is restricted and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to regulatory capital requirements.74AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. Actual capital and regulatory capital requirements for our wholly owned subsidiaries subject to regulatory capital requirements were as follows: Actual Capital Regulatory Capital Requirements March 31, 2014 December 31, 2013 March 31, 2014 December 31, 2013 (in millions)RiverSource Life(1)(2)$2,999 $2,747 N/A $591RiverSource Life of NY(1)(2)284 251 N/A 49IDS Property Casualty(1)(3)519 531 $182 177Ameriprise Insurance Company(1)(3)44 44 2 2ACC(4)(5)236 230 219 215Threadneedle(6)386 257 166 158Ameriprise National Trust Bank(7)13 19 10 10AFSI(3)(4)165 78 2 2Ameriprise Captive Insurance Company(3)65 62 15 11Ameriprise Trust Company(3)24 58 22 56AEIS(3)(4)73 100 46 44RiverSource Distributors, Inc.(3)(4)18 23 # #Columbia Management Investment Distributors, Inc.(3)(4)23 23 # #N/A Not applicable.# Amounts are less than $1 million.(1) Actual capital is determined on a statutory basis.(2) Regulatory capital requirement is based on the statutory risk-based capital filing.(3) Regulatory capital requirement is based on the applicable regulatory requirement, calculated as of March 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013.(4) Actual capital is determined on an adjusted GAAP basis.(5) ACC is required to hold capital in compliance with the Minnesota Department of Commerce and SEC capital requirements.(6) Actual capital and regulatory capital requirements are determined in accordance with U.K. regulatory legislation. The regulatory capital requirements at March 31, 2014 represent management’s assessment at December 31, 2013 of the risk based requirements, as specified by FCA regulations.(7) Ameriprise National Trust Bank is required to maintain capital in compliance with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency regulations and policies.In addition to the particular regulations restricting dividend payments and establishing subsidiary capitalization requirements, we take into account the overall health of the business, capital levels and risk management considerations in determining a dividend strategy for payments to our company from our subsidiaries, and in deciding to use cash to make capital contributions to our subsidiaries.During the three months ended March 31, 2014, the parent holding company received cash dividends or a return of capital from its subsidiaries of $350 million (including $150 million from RiverSource Life) and contributed cash to its subsidiaries of $3 million. During the three months ended March 31, 2013, the parent holding company received cash dividends or a return of capital from its subsidiaries of $575 million (including $325 million from RiverSource Life) and contributed cash to its subsidiaries of $16 million.Dividends Paid to Shareholders and Share RepurchasesWe paid regular quarterly dividends to our shareholders totaling $103 million and $94 million for the three months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. On April 28, 2014, we announced a quarterly dividend of $0.58 per common share. The dividend will be paid on May 23, 2014 to our shareholders of record at the close of business on May 9, 2014.In October 2012, our Board of Directors authorized an expenditure of up to $2.0 billion for the repurchase of shares of our common stock through 2014. As of March 31, 2014, we had $295 million remaining under this share repurchase authorization. In April 2014, our Board of Directors authorized an expenditure of up to an additional $2.5 billion for the repurchase of shares of our common stock through April 28, 2016. We intend to fund share repurchases through existing working capital, future earnings and other customary financing methods. The share repurchase programs do not require the purchase of any minimum number of shares, and depending on market conditions and other factors, these purchases may be commenced or suspended at any time without prior notice. Acquisitions under the share repurchase programs may be made in the open market, through privately negotiated transactions or block trades or other means. During the three months ended March 31, 2014, we repurchased a total of 3.2 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $109.54 per share.75AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. Cash FlowsCash flows of CIEs are reflected in our cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities, investing activities and financing activities. Cash held by CIEs is not available for general use by Ameriprise Financial, nor is Ameriprise Financial cash available for general use by its CIEs. As such, the operating, investing and financing cash flows of the CIEs have no impact to the change in cash and cash equivalents.Operating ActivitiesNet cash provided by operating activities was $434 million for the three months ended March 31, 2014 compared to net cash used in operating activities of $466 million for the prior year period. Cash activity related to our freestanding derivatives and related collateral resulted in an increase in cash of approximately $396 million compared to the prior year period. Cash flows related to investment properties of CIEs and other operating assets and liabilities of CIEs, net increased $142 million compared to the prior year period primarily due to lower purchases and higher sales of investment properties. Changes in cash held by CIEs increased $230 million compared to the prior year period.Investing ActivitiesOur investing activities primarily relate to our Available-for-Sale investment portfolio. Further, this activity is significantly affected by the net flows of our investment certificate, fixed annuity and universal life products reflected in financing activities.Net cash used in investing activities was $145 million for the three months ended March 31, 2014 compared to net cash provided by investing activities of $389 million for the prior year period. The decrease in cash of $534 million compared to the prior year period was primarily due to a $211 million increase in purchases of investments by consolidated investment entities and a $272 million decrease in proceeds from sales, maturities and repayments of investments by consolidated investment entities. Financing ActivitiesNet cash used in financing activities increased $407 million to $521 million for the three months ended March 31, 2014 compared to $114 million for the prior year period. Cash outflows from maturities, withdrawals and cash surrenders of investment certificates increased $125 million compared to the prior year period. Cash outflows from surrenders and other benefits of policyholder account balances increased $149 million compared to the prior year period. Cash outflows from changes in short-term borrowings increased $199 million compared to the prior year period as we reduced our borrowings from the FHLB in the first quarter of 2014. Cash inflows related to CIEs increased $101 million compared to the prior year period primarily due to a $206 million increase in cash from lower repayments of CIE debt, partially offset by a $116 million decrease in cash from changes in noncontrolling interests in CIEs.Contractual CommitmentsThere have been no material changes to our contractual obligations disclosed in our 2013 10-K. Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe provide asset management services to various collateralized debt obligations and other investment products, which are sponsored by us for the investment of client assets in the normal course of business. Certain of these investment entities are considered to be variable interest entities while others are considered to be voting rights entities. We consolidate certain of these investment entities. For entities that we do not consolidate, our maximum exposure to loss is our investment in the entity, which was not material as of March 31, 2014. We have no obligation to provide further financial or other support to these structured investments nor have we provided any support to these structured investments. See Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our arrangements with structured investments.76AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC.
