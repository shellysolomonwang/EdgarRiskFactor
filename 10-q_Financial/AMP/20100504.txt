ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS   Part I, Item 1A of our 2009 10-K sets forth information relating to the material risks and uncertainties that affect our business and common stock. In addition to those risk factors, we believe the following risk factor is also relevant to an understanding of our business, financial condition and results of operations.   Changes in accounting standards could have a material impact on our financial statements.   From time to time, the FASB, the SEC, and other regulators change the financial accounting and reporting standards governing the preparation of our financial statements. In some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in our restating prior period financial statements. These changes are difficult to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations and other financial data, even in instances where they may not have an economic impact on our business.   For example, the FASB updated the accounting standard related to the required consolidation of certain VIEs, effective January 1, 2010. We adopted the accounting standard effective January 1, 2010 and recorded as a cumulative change in accounting principle an increase to appropriated retained earnings of consolidated investment entities and consolidated client assets and liabilities in VIEs onto our consolidated balance sheets that were not previously consolidated. While the economics of our business have not changed, the financial statements were impacted. See “Adoption of New Accounting Standards — Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities” in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in this report, which portion is incorporated herein by reference. Further revisions to this standard may have an additional impact on us, which cannot be predicted at this time.   ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS
