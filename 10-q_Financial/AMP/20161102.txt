Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2015 10-K, “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2016 filed with the SEC on May 5, 2016, “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2016 filed with the SEC on August 1, 2016, this Form 10-Q and other factors as discussed herein.Equity price, credit market and interest rate fluctuations can have a significant impact on our results of operations, primarily due to the effects they have on the asset management and other asset-based fees we earn, the “spread” income generated on our fixed annuities, fixed insurance, deposit products and the fixed portion of variable annuities and variable insurance contracts, the value of deferred acquisition costs (“DAC”) and deferred sales inducement costs (“DSIC”) assets, the values of liabilities for guaranteed benefits associated with our variable annuities and the values of derivatives held to hedge these benefits.Earnings, as well as operating earnings, will continue to be negatively impacted by the ongoing low interest rate environment. In addition to continuing spread compression in our interest sensitive product lines, a sustained low interest rate environment may result in increases to our reserves and changes in various rate assumptions we use to amortize DAC and DSIC, which may negatively impact our operating earnings. For additional discussion on our interest rate risk, see Item 3. “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.”In the third quarter of the year, we updated our market-related inputs and implemented model changes related to our living benefit valuation. In addition, we conducted our annual review of life insurance and annuity valuation assumptions relative to current experience and management expectations including modeling changes. These aforementioned changes are collectively referred to as unlocking. Our unlocking process also impacts premium deficiency testing for certain insurance products. The unfavorable unlocking impact in the third quarter of 2016 primarily reflected continued low interest rates and higher persistency on living benefit contracts that more than offset benefits from persistency on annuity contracts without living benefits, an update to market-related inputs related to our living benefit valuation and other model updates. Our long-term interest rate assumption remains unchanged, but we extended the period it would take for rates to reach our long term level from 3.5 years to 5.5 years. In addition, our review of our closed long term care (“LTC”) business in the third quarter of 2016 resulted in a loss recognition of $31 million due to continued low interest rates, higher morbidity and higher reinsurance expenses, slightly offset by premium increases. The $31 million is comprised of $58 million of amortization of DAC and the release of the related deferred reinsurance liability of $27 million. The favorable unlocking impact in the third quarter of 2015 primarily reflected improved policyholder behavior, an update to market-related inputs related to our living benefit valuation and model changes that more than offset the difference between our previously assumed interest rates versus the low interest rate environment. Our review of our LTC business in the third quarter of 2015 resulted in no loss recognition as better-than-expected premium increases, which were reflected in our projections, offset higher morbidity and lower interest rates. See 56AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. our Consolidated and Segment Results of Operations sections below for the pretax impacts on our revenues and expenses attributable to unlocking and additional discussion of the drivers of the unlocking impact.We consolidate certain variable interest entities for which we provide asset management services. These entities are defined as consolidated investment entities (“CIEs”). While the consolidation of the CIEs impacts our balance sheet and income statement, our exposure to these entities is unchanged and there is no impact to the underlying business results. For further information on CIEs, see Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Effective January 1, 2016, we adopted ASU 2015-02 - Consolidation: Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis and deconsolidated several collateralized loan obligations (“CLOs”) and all previously consolidated property funds. See Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the adoption impact. Effective January 1, 2016, we no longer have net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests primarily due to the deconsolidation of property funds. The results of operations of the CIEs are reflected in the Corporate & Other segment. On a consolidated basis, the management fees we earn for the services we provide to the CIEs and the related general and administrative expenses are eliminated and the changes in the fair value of assets and liabilities related to the CIEs, primarily syndicated loans and debt, are reflected in net investment income. We continue to include the fees from these entities in the management and financial advice fees line within our Asset Management segment. Effective January 1, 2016, we adopted ASU 2014-13 - Consolidation: Measuring the Financial Assets and the Financial Liabilities of a Consolidated Collateralized Financing Entity and elected the measurement alternative. As a result, the carrying value of the CIE debt is set equal to the fair value of the CIE assets; therefore the changes in the fair value of assets and liabilities related to CIEs is nil. The CIE debt held by Ameriprise Financial is eliminated in consolidation. See Note 2 and Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.While our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), management believes that operating measures, which exclude net realized investment gains or losses, net of the related DSIC and DAC amortization, unearned revenue amortization and the reinsurance accrual; the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits, net of hedges and the related DSIC and DAC amortization; the market impact on indexed universal life benefits, net of hedges and the related DAC amortization, unearned revenue amortization and the reinsurance accrual; the market impact of hedges to offset interest rate changes on unrealized gains or losses for certain investments; integration and restructuring charges; income (loss) from discontinued operations; and the impact of consolidating CIEs, best reflect the underlying performance of our core operations and facilitate a more meaningful trend analysis. Management uses certain of these non-GAAP measures to evaluate our financial performance on a basis comparable to that used by some securities analysts and investors. Also, certain of these non-GAAP measures are taken into consideration, to varying degrees, for purposes of business planning and analysis and for certain compensation-related matters. Throughout our Management’s Discussion and Analysis, these non-GAAP measures are referred to as operating measures. These non-GAAP measures should not be viewed as a substitute for U.S. GAAP measures.It is management’s priority to increase shareholder value over a multi-year horizon by achieving our on-average, over-time financial targets.Our financial targets are:•Operating total net revenue growth of 6% to 8%,•Operating earnings per diluted share growth of 12% to 15%, and•Operating return on equity excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) of 19% to 23%.The following tables reconcile our GAAP measures to operating measures:  Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 2015 2016 2015 (in millions)Total net revenues$2,998 $2,886 $8,634 $9,067Less: Revenue attributable to CIEs27 43 77 333Less: Net realized gains (losses)6 (10) (5) 5Less: Market impact on indexed universal life benefits6 9 18 5Less: Market impact of hedges on investments5 (31) (54) (32)Operating total net revenues$2,954 $2,875 $8,598 $8,75657AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC.

After-tax is calculated using the statutory rate of 35%.On April 8, 2016, the Department of Labor published its final rule regarding the definition of who is an investment advice fiduciary under ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code, a new “best interest contract” prohibited transaction exemption regarding how such advice can be provided to retirement investors (primarily account holders in 401(k) plans and IRAs and other types of ERISA clients), a new class prohibited transaction exemption for how ERISA investment advice fiduciaries can engage in certain principal transactions with retirement investors, and certain amendments and partial revocations of pre-existing exemptions. These regulations focus in large part on conflicts of interest related to investment recommendations made by financial advisors, registered investment advisors, and other investment professionals to retirement investors, how financial advisors are able to discuss IRA rollovers, as well as how financial advisors and affiliates can transact with retirement investors. Qualified accounts, particularly IRAs, make up a significant portion of our assets under management and administration. We are continuing to review and analyze the potential impact of the regulations on our clients and prospective clients as well as the potential impact on our business. Teams across the company are working diligently to assess these principles-based rules and we will work with, and provide guidance to, our advisors to make the necessary changes to effectively implement these new rules.Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesThe accounting and reporting policies that we use affect our Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of our accounting and reporting policies are critical to an understanding of our consolidated results of operations and financial condition and, in some cases, the application of these policies can be significantly affected by the estimates, judgments and assumptions made by management during the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements. These accounting policies are discussed in detail in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis — Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” in our 2015 10-K.Recent Accounting PronouncementsFor information regarding recent accounting pronouncements and their expected impact on our future consolidated results of operations and financial condition, see Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.59AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. Assets Under Management and AdministrationAssets under management (“AUM”) include external client assets for which we provide investment management services, such as the assets of the Columbia funds and Threadneedle funds, assets of institutional clients and assets of clients in our advisor platform held in wrap accounts as well as assets managed by sub-advisers selected by us. AUM also includes certain assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets for which we provide investment management services and recognize management fees in our Asset Management segment, such as the assets of the general account and the variable product funds held in the separate accounts of our life insurance subsidiaries and CIEs. These assets do not include assets under advisement, for which we provide model portfolios but do not have full discretionary investment authority. Corporate & Other AUM primarily includes former bank assets that are managed within our Corporate & Other segment.Assets under administration (“AUA”) include assets for which we provide administrative services such as client assets invested in other companies’ products that we offer outside of our wrap accounts. These assets include those held in clients’ brokerage accounts. We generally record revenues received from administered assets as distribution fees. We do not exercise management discretion over these assets and do not earn a management fee. These assets are not reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. AUA also includes certain assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets for which we do not provide investment management services and do not recognize management fees, such as investments in non-affiliated funds held in the separate accounts of our life insurance subsidiaries. These assets do not include assets under advisement, for which we provide model portfolios but do not have full discretionary investment authority.The following table presents detail regarding our AUM and AUA: September 30,   2016 2015 Change (in billions)  Assets Under Management and Administration       Advice & Wealth Management AUM$196.2 $173.0 $23.2 13 %Asset Management AUM467.8 471.1 (3.3) (1)Corporate & Other AUM0.3 0.7 (0.4) (57)Eliminations(24.7) (22.2) (2.5) (11)Total Assets Under Management639.6 622.6 17.0 3Total Assets Under Administration156.0 143.2 12.8 9Total AUM and AUA$795.6 $765.8 $29.8 4 %Total AUM increased $17.0 billion, or 3%, to $639.6 billion as of September 30, 2016 compared to $622.6 billion as of September 30, 2015 reflecting a $23.2 billion increase in Advice & Wealth Management AUM driven by wrap account net inflows and market appreciation, partially offset by a $3.3 billion decrease in Asset Management AUM driven by net outflows and the negative impact of foreign currency translation, partially offset by market appreciation.

Consolidated Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 The following table presents our consolidated results of operations: Three Months Ended September 30,   2016 2015 Change (in millions)  Revenues       Management and financial advice fees$1,464 $1,465 $(1) — %Distribution fees455 451 4 1Net investment income387 321 66 21Premiums374 360 14 4Other revenues330 296 34 11Total revenues3,010 2,893 117 4Banking and deposit interest expense12 7 5 71Total net revenues2,998 2,886 112 4Expenses       Distribution expenses798 806 (8) (1)Interest credited to fixed accounts161 171 (10) (6)Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses855 471 384 82Amortization of deferred acquisition costs163 133 30 23Interest and debt expense52 98 (46) (47)General and administrative expense731 744 (13) (2)Total expenses2,760 2,423 337 14Pretax income238 463 (225) (49)Income tax provision23 111 (88) (79)Net income215 352 (137) (39)Less: Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests— (45) 45 NMNet income attributable to Ameriprise Financial$215 $397 $(182) (46)%NM Not Meaningful.OverallPretax income decreased $225 million, or 49%, to $238 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $463 million for the prior year period primarily due to the impact of unlocking, asset management net outflows, a $21 million increase in catastrophe losses, the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits (net of hedges and the related DSIC and DAC amortization) and an unfavorable $29 million LTC reserve correction in the third quarter of 2016, partially offset by market appreciation, a $36 million favorable change in the market impact of hedges on investments, favorable development in prior year auto and home reserves as well as improved current year loss performance, the impact on DAC, DSIC and reserves for insurance features in non-traditional long-duration contracts from actual versus expected market performance based on our view of bond and equity performance and a $45 million decrease in net loss from CIEs. Net loss from CIEs was nil for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $45 million for the prior year period primarily reflecting the deconsolidation of CIEs effective January 1, 2016. As we elected the measurement alternative for the remaining consolidated CLOs as of January 1, 2016, the carrying value of the CIE debt is set equal to the fair value of the CIE assets and therefore the changes in the fair value of assets and liabilities related to CIEs is nil for the three months ended September 30, 2016. The market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits (net of hedges and the related DSIC and DAC amortization) was an expense of $37 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to an expense of $5 million for the prior year period. The impact on DAC, DSIC and reserves for insurance features in non-traditional long-duration contracts from actual versus expected market performance based on our view of bond and equity performance was a benefit of $14 million ($8 million for DAC, $2 million for DSIC and $4 million for insurance features in non-traditional long duration contracts) for the three months ended September 30, 2016 reflecting favorable equity market and bond fund returns compared to an expense of $36 million ($25 million 61AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. for DAC, $6 million for DSIC and $5 million for insurance features in non-traditional long duration contracts) for the prior year period reflecting unfavorable equity market and bond fund returns. The following table presents the total pretax impacts on our revenues and expenses attributable to unlocking for the three months ended September 30:Pretax Increase (Decrease) 2016 2015  (in millions)Premiums $— $(3)Other revenues 64 8Total revenues 64 5     Distribution expenses (27) —Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses 229 (58)Amortization of DAC 81 15Total expenses 283 (43)Total (1) $(219) $48(1) Includes a $16 million and $6 million net benefit related to the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits and indexed universal life benefits for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.Net RevenuesNet revenues increased $112 million, or 4%, to $3.0 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $2.9 billion for the prior year period primarily due to increases in net investment income and other revenues. Net revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2016 included $27 million of CIE revenues compared to $43 million for the prior year period primarily reflecting the CIE deconsolidation. Net investment income increased $66 million, or 21%, to $387 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $321 million for the prior year period primarily due to an increase in CIE net investment income, the market impact of hedges on investments, and net realized investment gains (losses), partially offset by a $10 million impairment on an affordable housing investment in the third quarter of 2016 to align it with the remaining tax benefit cash flows. Net realized investment gains were $6 million for the the third quarter of 2016 compared to net realized investment losses of $10 million for the prior year period. The market impact of hedges on investments was a gain of $5 million for the third quarter of 2016 compared to a loss of $31 million for the prior year period. Net investment income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 included $31 million of CIE net investment income compared to $2 million for the prior year period. Other revenues increased $34 million, or 11%, to $330 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $296 million for the prior year period primarily due to the impact of unlocking, higher fees from variable annuity guarantee sales in the prior year where the fees start on the first anniversary date and higher average fee rates and a $9 million unfavorable impact related to a life reinsurance premium correction in the prior year period, partially offset by a $56 million decrease in CIE other revenues reflecting the CIE deconsolidation. Other revenues for the third quarter of 2016 included a $64 million favorable impact from unlocking compared to an $8 million favorable impact in the prior year period. The primary driver of the unlocking impact to other revenues for the third quarter of 2016 was a positive impact from higher projected gains on reinsurance contracts resulting from unfavorable mortality experience. The primary driver of the unlocking impact to other revenues for the prior year period was a positive impact from model updates related to our indexed universal life product, partially offset by a negative impact from lower projected gains on reinsurance contracts resulting from favorable mortality experience.ExpensesTotal expenses increased $337 million, or 14%, to $2.8 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $2.4 billion for the prior year period primarily due to the impact of unlocking, partially offset by the CIE deconsolidation. Expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 included $27 million of CIE expenses compared to $88 million for the prior year period primarily reflecting the CIE deconsolidation. Distribution expenses decreased $8 million, or 1%, to $798 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $806 million for the prior year period driven by a $27 million benefit related to the write-off of the deferred reinsurance liability in connection with loss recognition testing of LTC insurance products in the third quarter of 2016, partially offset by higher compensation-related expense. Interest credited to fixed accounts decreased $10 million, or 6%, to $161 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $171 million for the prior year period primarily due to lower average fixed annuity account balances and the market impact on indexed universal life benefits, net of hedges, partially offset by higher average variable annuities fixed sub-account balances. The market impact on indexed universal life benefits, net of hedges was a benefit of $5 million for the three months ended 62AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. September 30, 2016 compared to an expense of $4 million for the prior year period. Average fixed annuity account balances decreased $789 million, or 7%, to $10.2 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the prior year period as older policies continue to lapse and new sales are limited due to low interest rates. Average variable annuities fixed sub-account balances increased $213 million, or 4%, to $5.1 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the prior year period.Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses increased $384 million, or 82%, to $855 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $471 million for the prior year period primarily reflecting the following items:•The three months ended September 30, 2016 included a $229 million expense from unlocking compared to a $58 million benefit in the prior year period. The unlocking impact for the third quarter of 2016 primarily reflected continued low interest rates and an unfavorable impact from persistency on living benefit reserves, partially offset by a benefit from updates to withdrawal utilization and fee assumptions, as well as market-related inputs related to our living benefit valuation. The unlocking impact for the prior year period primarily reflected an update to market-related inputs related to our living benefit valuation and a benefit from model changes that more than offset the difference between our previously assumed interest rates versus the low interest rate environment.•A $29 million increase in LTC reserves from a correction related to our claim utilization assumption in the third quarter of 2016.•A $13 million decrease in expense in the third quarter of 2015 related to a LTC future loss reserve adjustment.•An $8 million increase in expense related to higher reserve funding driven by the impact of higher fees from variable annuity guarantee sales in the prior year where the fees start on the first anniversary date.•A $17 million decrease in expense due to the impact on DSIC and insurance features in non-traditional long duration contracts from actual versus expected market performance based on our view of bond and equity performance. This impact was a benefit of $6 million for the third quarter of 2016 compared to an expense of $11 million for the prior year period reflecting favorable equity market and bond fund returns in the third quarter of 2016 compared to unfavorable equity market and bond fund returns in the prior year period.•A $182 million increase in expense compared to the prior year period from the unhedged nonperformance credit spread risk adjustment on variable annuity guaranteed benefits. As the embedded derivative liability on which the nonperformance credit spread is applied increases (decreases), the impact of the nonperformance credit spread is favorable (unfavorable) to expense. The favorable impact of the nonperformance credit spread was $3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to a favorable impact of $185 million for the prior year period.•A $135 million decrease in expense from other market impacts on variable annuity guaranteed benefits, net of hedges in place to offset those risks and the related DSIC amortization. This decrease was the result of a favorable $1.4 billion change in the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits reserves, an unfavorable $1.3 billion change in the market impact on derivatives hedging the variable annuity guaranteed benefits and a favorable $2 million DSIC offset. The main market drivers contributing to these changes are summarized below:•Interest rate impact on the variable annuity guaranteed living benefits liability net of the impact on the corresponding hedge assets resulted in a lower expense in the third quarter of 2016 compared to the prior year period.•Equity market impact on the variable annuity guaranteed living benefits liability net of the impact on the corresponding hedge assets resulted in a benefit in the third quarter of 2016 compared to an expense in the prior year period.•Other unhedged items, including the difference between the assumed and actual underlying separate account investment performance, fixed income credit exposures, transaction costs and various behavioral items, were a net favorable impact compared to the prior year period.Amortization of DAC increased $30 million, or 23%, to $163 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $133 million for the prior year period primarily reflecting the following items:•The impact of unlocking was an expense of $81 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to an expense of $15 million for the prior year period. The impact of unlocking in the third quarter of 2016 primarily reflected continued low interest rates that more than offset benefits from persistency on annuity contracts without living benefits. Our long-term interest rate assumption remains unchanged, but we extended the period it would take for rates to reach our long term level from 3.5 years to 5.5 years. In addition, in connection with the loss recognition on LTC insurance products in the third quarter of 2016, we wrote-off $58 million of DAC due to continued low interest rates, higher morbidity and higher reinsurance expenses, slightly offset by premium increases. •The impact on DAC from actual versus expected market performance based on our view of bond and equity performance was a benefit of $8 million for the third quarter of 2016 compared to an expense of $25 million for the prior year period reflecting favorable equity market and bond fund returns in the third quarter of 2016 compared to unfavorable equity market and bond fund returns in the prior year period.63AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. Interest and debt expense decreased $46 million, or 47%, to $52 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $98 million for the prior year period primarily due to a $43 million decrease in CIE interest and debt expense reflecting the CIE deconsolidation. General and administrative expenses decreased $13 million, or 2%, to $731 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $744 million for the prior year period due an $18 million decrease in CIE expenses reflecting the CIE deconsolidation and a positive impact of foreign exchange, partially offset by $7 million of incremental expense related to the planning and implementation of the new Department of Labor fiduciary standard and higher performance related compensation. The positive impact of foreign exchange was more than offset by a negative impact of foreign exchange on management and financial advice fees. Income TaxesOur effective tax rate was 9.7% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 24.1% for the prior year period. The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was lower than the statutory rate as a result of tax preferred items including the dividends received deduction, low income housing tax credits, and lower taxes on net income from foreign subsidiaries. The decrease in the effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the prior year period was primarily due to lower pretax income.Results of Operations by Segment for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 Operating earnings is the measure of segment profit or loss management uses to evaluate segment performance. Operating earnings should not be viewed as a substitute for GAAP pretax income. We believe the presentation of segment operating earnings as we measure it for management purposes enhances the understanding of our business by reflecting the underlying performance of our core operations and facilitating a more meaningful trend analysis. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the presentation of segment results and our definition of operating earnings.The following table presents summary financial information by segment: Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 2015 (in millions)Advice & Wealth Management   Net revenues$1,272 $1,245Expenses1,041 1,026Operating earnings$231 $219Asset Management   Net revenues$740 $782Expenses585 602Operating earnings$155 $180Annuities   Net revenues$631 $632Expenses699 456Operating earnings (loss)$(68) $176Protection   Net revenues$679 $586Expenses668 561Operating earnings$11 $25Corporate & Other   Net revenues$(15) $(4)Expenses57 38Operating loss$(72) $(42)64AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC.

Pretax operating margin was 18.2% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 17.6% for the prior year period.Net RevenuesNet revenues exclude net realized investment gains or losses. Net revenues increased $27 million, or 2%, to $1.3 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $1.2 billion for the prior year period primarily due to higher management fees. Operating net revenue per branded advisor increased to $131,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, up 3%, from $127,000 for the prior year period. Total branded advisors were 9,747 at September 30, 2016 compared to 9,814 at September 30, 2015. Management and financial fees increased $31 million, or 5%, to $689 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $658 million for the prior year period due to growth in wrap account assets. Average advisory wrap account assets increased $15.0 billion, or 8%, compared to the prior year period primarily reflecting net inflows and equity market appreciation. Distribution fees decreased $9 million, or 2%, to $531 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $540 million for the prior year period primarily due to lower transactional volume, partially offset by higher brokerage cash spread due to an increase in short-term interest rates and equity market appreciation.ExpensesTotal expenses increased $15 million, or 1%, to $1.0 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the prior year period primarily due to a $17 million increase in distribution expenses reflecting higher advisor compensation due to equity market appreciation and wrap account net inflows, partially offset by lower transactional volume.Asset ManagementFee waivers have been provided to the Columbia Money Market Funds (the “Funds”) by Columbia and certain other subsidiaries performing services for the Funds for the purpose of reducing the expenses charged to a Fund in a given period to maintain or improve a Fund’s net yield in that period. Our subsidiaries may enter into contractual arrangements with the Funds identifying the specific fees to be waived and/or expenses to be reimbursed, as well as the time period for which such waivers will apply. In aggregate, we voluntarily waived fees of $1 million and $2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.On September 1, 2016, we completed our acquisition of Emerging Global Advisors, LLC (“EGA”), a New York-based registered investment adviser and provider of strategic beta portfolios focused on emerging markets.

Aggregated Allocation (Managed) Funds include funds that invest in other funds of the Threadneedle range including those funds that invest in both equity and fixed income. Aggregated Threadneedle data includes funds on the Threadneedle platform sub-advised by Columbia as well as advisors not affiliated with Ameriprise Financial, Inc.Beginning in the first quarter of 2016, the Columbia and Threadneedle AUM rollforwards have been combined to align with the Columbia Threadneedle Investments brand, which represents the combined capabilities, resources and reach of both firms. In addition, we combined the rollforwards for Institutional and Alternative AUM and included the change in Affiliated General Account Assets in the market appreciation (depreciation) and other line within the combined AUM rollforward. All changes were made on a retrospective basis. 68AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC.

(3) Prior to the third quarter of 2016, the Foreign currency translation line represented British Pound to US dollar conversion, while the impact of translating assets from a local currency to British Pounds was included in Market appreciation (depreciation) and other. Beginning with the third quarter of 2016, the impact of translating assets from a local currency to British Pounds has been reclassified to the Foreign currency translation line. All prior periods have been restated. (4) Includes $0.8 billion and $0.3 billion for the total change in Affiliated General Account Assets during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.(5) Former parent company related assets and net new flows are included in the rollforwards above.On June 23, 2016, the United Kingdom (UK) held a referendum on membership of the European Union (EU) and the British public voted to leave the EU, which caused volatility in capital and currency markets. The full impact of the UK referendum result remains uncertain. This uncertainty, which is expected to last for a lengthy period of time, has had and may continue to have a negative impact on our UK and European net flows and foreign currency translation resulting from the weakening of the British Pound.Total segment AUM increased $8.2 billion, or 2%, during the three months ended September 30, 2016 driven by market appreciation and other, partially offset by net outflows and a negative impact of foreign currency translation. Total segment AUM net outflows were $4.3 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2016, which included $1.4 billion of outflows of former parent-related assets. Management expects, consistent with prior patterns of outflows, that outflows of primarily low margin assets directly or indirectly affiliated with Threadneedle and Columbia former parent companies will continue for the foreseeable future. The overall impact to segment results is difficult to quantify due to uncertain timing, volume and mix of the outflows. Global retail funds increased $6.8 billion, or 3%, during the three months ended September 30, 2016 due to market appreciation and other, partially offset by net outflows and a negative impact of foreign currency translation. Global retail net outflows of $0.9 billion during the three months ended September 30, 2016 included $0.6 billion of outflows from the Columbia Acorn® Fund, $0.6 billion of outflows of our variable product funds underlying insurance and annuity separate accounts, and $0.4 billion of UK and European net outflows, partially offset by inflows of $1.0 billion related to the EGA acquisition. Global institutional AUM increased $1.4 billion, or 1%, during the three months ended September 30, 2016 due to market appreciation and other, partially offset by net outflows of $3.4 billion and a $2.3 billion negative impact of foreign currency translation. Global institutional net outflows included $1.4 billion of outflows of former parent-related assets and $0.7 billion of outflows from Acorn strategies. The following table presents the results of operations of our Asset Management segment on an operating basis: Three Months Ended September 30, Change 2016 2015 (in millions)  Revenues       Management and financial advice fees$612 $656 $(44) (7)%Distribution fees125 123 2 2Net investment income1 1 — —Other revenues2 2 — —Total revenues740 782 (42) (5)Banking and deposit interest expense— — — —Total net revenues740 782 (42) (5)Expenses       Distribution expenses261 270 (9) (3)Amortization of deferred acquisition costs4 4 — —Interest and debt expense5 6 (1) (17)General and administrative expense315 322 (7) (2)Total expenses585 602 (17) (3)Operating earnings$155 $180 $(25) (14)%Our Asset Management segment pretax operating earnings, which exclude net realized investment gains or losses, decreased $25 million, or 14%, to $155 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $180 million for the prior year period primarily due to net outflows, partially offset by market appreciation. Net RevenuesNet revenues, which exclude net realized investment gains or losses, decreased $42 million, or 5%, to $740 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $782 million for the prior year period primarily due to a decrease in management and financial advice fees.70AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. Management and financial advice fees decreased $44 million, or 7%, to $612 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $656 million for the prior year period primarily due to lower asset-based fees driven by a decrease in average AUM. Average AUM decreased $25.2 billion, or 5%, compared to the prior year period due to net outflows and the negative impact of foreign currency translation, partially offset by market appreciation. Our average weighted equity index, which is a proxy for equity movements on AUM, increased 4% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the prior year period. ExpensesTotal expenses decreased $17 million, or 3%, to $585 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $602 million for the prior year period due to a $9 million decrease in distribution expenses from lower retail fund assets and a decrease in general and administrative expense. General and administrative expense decreased $7 million, or 2%, to $315 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $322 million for the prior year period primarily due to a positive impact of foreign exchange, partially offset by higher performance related compensation. The positive impact of foreign exchange was more than offset by a negative impact of foreign exchange on management and financial advice fees. AnnuitiesThe following table presents the results of operations of our Annuities segment on an operating basis: Three Months Ended September 30, Change 2016 2015 (in millions)  Revenues       Management and financial advice fees$188 $187 $1 1 %Distribution fees89 91 (2) (2)Net investment income192 208 (16) (8)Premiums29 25 4 16Other revenues133 121 12 10Total revenues631 632 (1) —Banking and deposit interest expense— — — —Total net revenues631 632 (1) —Expenses      Distribution expenses106 111 (5) (5)Interest credited to fixed accounts122 125 (3) (2)Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses346 89 257 NMAmortization of deferred acquisition costs66 66 — —Interest and debt expense7 10 (3) (30)General and administrative expense52 55 (3) (5)Total expenses699 456 243 53 %Operating earnings (loss)$(68) $176 $(244) NMNM Not Meaningful.Our Annuities segment pretax operating income (loss), which excludes net realized investment gains or losses (net of the related DSIC and DAC amortization) and the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits (net of hedges and the related DSIC and DAC amortization), was a loss of $68 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to income of $176 million for the prior year period primarily due to the impact of unlocking and lower investment yields, partially offset by equity market appreciation and the impact on DAC, DSIC and reserves for insurance features in non-traditional long-duration contracts from actual versus expected market performance based on our view of bond and equity performance. The impact on DAC, DSIC and reserves for insurance features in non-traditional long-duration contracts from actual versus expected market performance based on our view of bond and equity performance was a benefit of $13 million ($7 million for DAC, $2 million for DSIC and $4 million for insurance features in non-traditional long duration contracts) for the three months ended September 30, 2016 reflecting favorable equity market and bond fund returns compared to an expense of $34 million ($23 million for DAC, $6 million for DSIC and $5 million for insurance features in non-traditional long duration contracts) for the prior year period reflecting unfavorable equity market and bond fund returns.71AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. RiverSource variable annuity account balances increased 4% to $75.9 billion at September 30, 2016 compared to the prior year period due to equity market appreciation, partially offset by net outflows of $1.7 billion. RiverSource fixed annuity account balances declined 7% to $10.2 billion at September 30, 2016 compared to the prior year period as older policies continue to lapse and new sales are limited due to low interest rates. Given the current interest rate environment, our current fixed annuity book is expected to gradually run off and earnings on our fixed annuity business will trend down.Net RevenuesNet revenues, which exclude net realized investment gains or losses, were essentially flat at $631 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $632 million for the prior year period as a decrease in net investment income was offset by higher premiums and other revenues.Net investment income, which excludes net realized investment gains or losses, decreased $16 million, or 8%, to $192 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $208 million for the prior year period reflecting a decrease of approximately $10 million from lower invested assets primarily due to fixed annuity net outflows and approximately $6 million from lower interest rates.Other revenues increased $12 million, or 10%, to $133 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $121 million for the prior year period due to higher fees from variable annuity guarantee sales in the prior year where the fees start on the first anniversary date and higher average fee rates.ExpensesTotal expenses, which exclude the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits (net of hedges and the related DSIC and DAC amortization) and the DAC and DSIC offset to net realized investment gains or losses, increased $243 million, or 53%, to $699 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $456 million for the prior year period due to the impact of unlocking, partially offset by the impact on DAC and DSIC from actual versus expected market performance based on our view of bond and equity performance. Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses, which exclude the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits (net of hedges and the related DSIC amortization) and the DSIC offset to net realized investment gains or losses, increased $257 million to $346 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $89 million for the prior year period primarily reflecting the following items: •Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses for the third quarter of 2016 included a $197 million expense from unlocking primarily reflecting continued low interest rates and an unfavorable impact from persistency on living benefit reserves, partially offset by a benefit from updates to withdrawal utilization and fee assumptions, as well as market-related inputs related to our living benefit valuation. Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses for the third quarter of 2015 included a $61 million benefit from unlocking primarily reflecting an update to market-related inputs related to our living benefit valuation and a benefit from model changes that more than offset the difference between our previously assumed interest rates versus the low interest rate environment. •An $8 million increase in expense related to higher reserve funding driven by the impact of higher fees from variable annuity guarantee sales in the prior year where the fees start on the first anniversary date.•A $17 million decrease in expense compared to the prior year period due to the impact on DSIC and insurance features in non-traditional long duration contracts from actual versus expected market performance based on our view of bond and equity performance. This impact was a benefit of $6 million for the third quarter of 2016 compared to an expense of $11 million for the prior year period reflecting favorable equity market and bond fund returns in the third quarter of 2016 compared to unfavorable equity market and bond fund returns in the prior year period.Amortization of DAC was flat at $66 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the prior year period primarily reflecting the unfavorable impact of unlocking, offset by the impact on DAC from actual versus expected market performance based on our view of bond and equity performance, which was a benefit of $7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to an expense of $23 million for the prior year period reflecting favorable equity market and bond fund returns in the third quarter of 2016 compared to unfavorable equity market and bond fund returns in the prior year period. Amortization of DAC for the third quarter of 2016 included an $18 million expense from unlocking reflecting continued low interest rates, partially offset by benefits from persistency on annuity contracts without living benefits. Our long-term interest rate assumption remains unchanged, but we extended the period it would take for rates to reach our long term level from 3.5 years to 5.5 years. Amortization of DAC for the third quarter of 2015 included a $5 million benefit from unlocking primarily driven by improved persistency that more than offset the difference between our previously assumed interest rates versus the low interest rate environment.72AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC.

Other revenues for the third quarter of 2016 included a $64 million favorable impact from unlocking compared to a $5 million unfavorable impact in the prior year period. The primary driver of the unlocking impact to other revenues for the third quarter of 2016 was a positive impact from higher projected gains on reinsurance contracts resulting from unfavorable mortality experience. The primary driver of the unlocking impact to other revenues for the prior year period was a positive impact from model updates related to our indexed universal life product, partially offset by a negative impact from lower projected gains on reinsurance contracts resulting from favorable mortality experience.ExpensesTotal expenses, which exclude the market impact on indexed universal life benefits (net of hedges and the related DAC amortization) and the DAC offset to net realized investment gains or losses, increased $107 million, or 19%, to $668 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $561 million for the prior year period primarily due to the impact of unlocking, a $29 million increase in LTC reserves from a correction related to our claim utilization assumption in the third quarter of 2016 and a $13 million decrease in the third quarter of 2015 related to a LTC future loss reserve adjustment. 73AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. Distribution expenses decreased $26 million to a negative $14 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $12 million for the prior year period primarily due to a $27 million benefit related to the write-off of the deferred reinsurance liability in connection with loss recognition testing of LTC insurance products in the third quarter of 2016.Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses increased $80 million, or 21%, to $464 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $384 million for the prior year period primarily due to the impact of unlocking, higher catastrophe losses, a $29 million increase in LTC reserves from a correction related to our claim utilization assumption in the third quarter of 2016 and a $13 million decrease in the third quarter of 2015 related to a LTC future loss reserve adjustment, partially offset by a $10 million positive impact from prior year auto and home reserve development and improved current year loss performance. The unlocking impact for the third quarter of 2016 was $46 million and primarily reflected continued low interest rates and unfavorable mortality experience. The impact of unlocking for the prior year period was $6 million. Catastrophe losses were $29 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $8 million for the prior year period. Amortization of DAC increased $47 million, or 94%, to $97 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $50 million for the prior year period primarily due to the impact of unlocking. The impact of unlocking was an expense of $65 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to an expense of $10 million for the prior year period. The unlocking impact for the third quarter of 2016 primarily reflected the DAC write-off of $58 million in connection with the loss recognition on LTC insurance products due to continued low interest rates, higher morbidity and higher reinsurance expenses, slightly offset by premium increases. The unlocking impact for the prior year period was primarily driven by the difference between our previously assumed interest rates versus the low interest rate environment.Corporate & OtherThe following table presents the results of operations of our Corporate & Other segment on an operating basis: Three Months Ended September 30, Change 2016 2015 (in millions)  Revenues       Net investment loss$(18) $(5) $(13) NMOther revenues4 1 3 NMTotal revenues(14) (4) (10) NMBanking and deposit interest expense1 — 1 —Total net revenues(15) (4) (11) NMExpenses       Interest and debt expense5 3 2 67General and administrative expense52 35 17 49Total expenses57 38 19 50Operating loss$(72) $(42) $(30) (71)%NM Not Meaningful.Our Corporate & Other segment pretax operating loss excludes net realized investment gains or losses, the market impact of hedges to offset interest rate changes on unrealized gains or losses for certain investments, integration and restructuring charges, and the impact of consolidating CIEs. Our Corporate & Other segment pretax operating loss increased $30 million, or 71%, to $72 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $42 million for the prior year period primarily due to increases in net investment loss and general and administrative expense. Net investment loss increased $13 million to $18 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $5 million for the prior year period primarily due to a $10 million impairment on an affordable housing partnership investment in the third quarter of 2016 to align it with the remaining tax benefit cash flows.General and administrative expense increased $17 million, or 49%, to $52 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $35 million for the prior year period primarily due to $7 million of incremental expense related to the planning and implementation of the new Department of Labor fiduciary standard and higher performance based compensation. 74AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC.

Results for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 included $34 million of management fees we earned for services provided to deconsolidated CIEs. These fees were eliminated on a consolidated basis in the prior year period.The market impact on indexed universal life benefits (net of hedges and the related DAC amortization, unearned revenue amortization and the reinsurance accrual) was a benefit of $31 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to an expense of $2 million for the prior year period.The impact on DAC, DSIC and reserves for insurance features in non-traditional long-duration contracts from actual versus expected market performance based on our view of bond and equity performance was a benefit of $5 million ($3 million for DAC, $1 million for DSIC and $1 million for insurance features in non-traditional long duration contracts) for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 reflecting favorable equity market and bond fund returns compared to a net expense of $20 million ($20 million for DAC, $5 million for DSIC and a $5 million benefit for insurance features in non-traditional long duration contracts) for the prior year period reflecting unfavorable equity market and bond fund returns. 75AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. See the table of total pretax impacts on our revenues and expenses attributable to unlocking within our Consolidated Results of Operations for the three months ended September 30, 2016.Net RevenuesNet revenues decreased $433 million, or 5%, to $8.6 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $9.1 billion for the prior year period primarily due to decreases in management and financial advice fees, distribution fees, net investment income and other revenues. Net revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 included $77 million of CIE revenues compared to $333 million for the prior year period primarily reflecting the CIE deconsolidation. Management and financial advice fees decreased $162 million, or 4%, to $4.3 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $4.5 billion for the prior year period primarily due to lower asset-based fees driven by a decrease in average AUM, as well as a $16 million decrease in performance fees. Average AUM decreased $32.9 billion, or 5%, compared to the prior year period due to asset management net outflows, market depreciation and the negative impact of foreign currency translation, partially offset by wrap account net inflows. See our discussion on the changes in AUM in our segment results of operations section. Management and financial advice fees for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 included $34 million of fees we earned for services provided to CLOs and property funds that were deconsolidated effective January 1, 2016. These fees were eliminated on a consolidated basis in the prior year period.Distribution fees decreased $51 million, or 4%, to $1.3 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $1.4 billion for the prior year period primarily due to market depreciation and lower transactional volume, partially offset by higher brokerage cash spread due to an increase in short-term interest rates.Net investment income decreased $138 million, or 11%, to $1.1 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $1.2 billion for the prior year period primarily due to a $72 million decrease in CIE net investment income, a $22 million unfavorable change in the market impact of hedges on investments and a $27 million decrease in investment income on fixed maturities driven by low interest rates. In addition, net realized investment losses were $5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, which included an $11 million loss from the sale of consumer loans, compared to net realized investment gains of $5 million for the prior year period. Net investment income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 included $89 million CIE net investment income compared to $161 million for the prior year period primarily reflecting the CIE deconsolidation.Other revenues decreased $107 million, or 11%, to $832 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $939 million for the prior year period due to a $216 million decrease in CIE other revenues reflecting the CIE deconsolidation, partially offset by the impact of unlocking, the unearned revenue amortization and the reinsurance accrual offset to the market impact on indexed universal life benefits and higher fees from variable annuity guarantee sales in the prior year where the fees start on the first anniversary date and higher average fee rates. The unearned revenue amortization and the reinsurance accrual offset to the market impact on indexed universal life benefits was a positive $18 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to a positive $5 million for the prior year period. Other revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 included a $64 million favorable impact from unlocking compared to an $8 million favorable impact in the prior year period. The primary driver of the unlocking impact to other revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was a positive impact from higher projected gains on reinsurance contracts resulting from unfavorable mortality experience. The primary driver of the unlocking impact to other revenues for the prior year period was a positive impact from model updates related to our indexed universal life product, partially offset by a negative impact from lower projected gains on reinsurance contracts resulting from favorable mortality experience.ExpensesTotal expenses increased $140 million, or 2%, to $7.5 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $7.4 billion for the prior year period primarily due to the impact of unlocking, partially offset by the CIE deconsolidation. Expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 included $78 million of CIE expenses compared to $231 million for the prior year period primarily reflecting the CIE deconsolidation.Distribution expenses decreased $89 million, or 4%, to $2.4 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $2.5 billion for the prior year period driven by lower advisor compensation due to equity market depreciation and lower transactional volume, as well as a $27 million benefit related to the write-off of the deferred reinsurance liability in connection with loss recognition testing of LTC insurance products in the third quarter of 2016. Interest credited to fixed accounts decreased $38 million, or 8%, to $465 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $503 million for the prior year period primarily due to lower average fixed annuity account balances and the market impact on indexed universal life benefits, net of hedges, partially offset by higher average variable annuities fixed sub-account balances. The market impact on indexed universal life benefits, net of hedges was a benefit of $25 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to an expense of $5 million for the prior year period. Average fixed annuity account balances decreased $1.0 billion, or 9%, to $10.4 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the prior year period as older policies continue to lapse and new sales are limited due to low interest rates. Average variable annuities fixed sub-account balances increased $149 million, or 3%, to $5.0 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the prior year period.76AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses increased $387 million, or 25%, to $1.9 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $1.5 billion for the prior year period primarily reflecting the following items:•The nine months ended September 30, 2016 included a $229 million expense from unlocking compared to a $58 million benefit in the prior year period. The unlocking impact for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 primarily reflected continued low interest rates and an unfavorable impact from persistency on living benefit reserves, partially offset by a benefit from updates to withdrawal utilization and fee assumptions, as well as market-related inputs related to our living benefit valuation. The unlocking impact for the prior year period primarily reflected an update to market-related inputs related to our living benefit valuation and a benefit from model changes that more than offset the difference between our previously assumed interest rates versus the low interest rate environment.•A $24 million increase in catastrophe losses compared to the prior year period.•A $29 million increase in LTC reserves from a correction related to our claim utilization assumption in the third quarter of 2016.•An $18 million increase in expense related to higher reserve funding driven by the impact of higher fees from variable annuity guarantee sales in the prior year where the fees start on the first anniversary date.Amortization of DAC increased $58 million, or 19%, to $360 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $302 million for the prior year period primarily reflecting the following items:•The impact of unlocking was an expense of $81 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to an expense of $15 million for the prior year period. The unlocking impact for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 primarily reflected continued low interest rates that more than offset benefits from persistency on annuity contracts without living benefits. In addition, in connection with the loss recognition on LTC insurance products in the third quarter of 2016, we wrote-off $58 million of DAC due to continued low interest rates, higher morbidity and higher reinsurance expenses, slightly offset by premium increases. •The impact on DAC from actual versus expected market performance based on our view of bond and equity performance was a benefit of $3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to an expense of $20 million for the prior year period reflecting favorable equity market and bond fund returns in the current year period compared to unfavorable equity market and bond fund returns in the prior year period.•The DAC offset to the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits (net of hedges and the related DSIC amortization) was an expense of $6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to a benefit of $1 million for the prior year period.Interest and debt expense decreased $111 million, or 41%, to $160 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $271 million for the prior year period primarily due to a $105 million decrease in CIE interest and debt expense reflecting the CIE deconsolidation. General and administrative expenses decreased $67 million, or 3%, to $2.2 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $2.3 billion for the prior year period primarily due a $48 million decrease in CIE expenses reflecting the CIE deconsolidation, a $9 million sales and use tax reserve release in the first quarter of 2016, an $8 million decrease in compensation related to lower performance fees, a benefit from the impact of foreign exchange and lower investment spending, partially offset by $19 million of incremental expense related to the planning and implementation of the new Department of Labor fiduciary standard and $23 million of expense in the second quarter of 2016 from the resolution of a legacy legal matter related to the hedge fund business. Income TaxesOur effective tax rate was 18.6% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 23.0% for the prior year period. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was lower than the statutory rate as a result of tax preferred items including the dividends received deduction, low income housing tax credits, and lower taxes on net income from foreign subsidiaries. The decrease in the effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the prior year period was primarily due to lower pretax income.77AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC.

Pretax operating margin was 17.7% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 17.3% for the prior year period.Net RevenuesNet revenues exclude net realized investment gains or losses. Net revenues decreased $27 million, or 1%, to $3.7 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the prior year period due to lower distribution fees, partially offset by higher management and financial advice fees and net investment income. Operating net revenue per branded advisor decreased to $382,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, down 1%, from $385,000 for the prior year period reflecting lower transactional transactional volume. Management and financial fees increased $28 million, or 1%, to $2.0 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the prior year period due to growth in wrap account assets. Average advisory wrap account assets increased $6.8 billion, or 4%, compared to the prior year period reflecting net inflows, partially offset by equity market depreciation. Distribution fees decreased $75 million, or 5%, to $1.6 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the prior year period primarily due to lower transactional volume and equity market depreciation, partially offset by higher brokerage cash spread due to an increase in short-term interest rates.Net investment income increased $30 million, or 28%, to $138 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $108 million for the prior year period primarily due to an increase in invested balances driven by certificate net inflows and higher investment yields.ExpensesTotal expenses decreased $35 million, or 1%, to $3.1 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the prior year period due to a $29 million decrease in distribution expenses reflecting lower advisor compensation due to equity market depreciation and lower transactional volume.Asset ManagementIn aggregate, we voluntarily waived fees of $2 million and $6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

(4) Prior to the third quarter of 2016, the Foreign currency translation line represented British Pound to US dollar conversion, while the impact of translating assets from a local currency to British Pounds was included in Market appreciation (depreciation) and other. Beginning with the third quarter of 2016, the impact of translating assets from a local currency to British Pounds has been reclassified to the Foreign currency translation line. All prior periods have been restated.(5) Includes $2.6 billion and $(0.7) billion for the total change in Affiliated General Account Assets during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.(6) Former parent company related assets and net new flows are included in the rollforwards above.Total segment AUM decreased $4.1 billion, or 1%, during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 driven by net outflows, a negative impact of foreign currency translation and retail fund distributions, partially offset by market appreciation and other. Total segment AUM net outflows were $16.5 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, which included $8.0 billion of outflows of former parent-related assets. Management expects, consistent with prior patterns of outflows, that outflows of primarily low margin assets directly or indirectly affiliated with Threadneedle and Columbia former parent companies will continue for the foreseeable future. The overall impact to segment results is difficult to quantify due to uncertain timing, volume and mix of the outflows. Global retail funds increased $2.1 billion, or 1%, during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 due to market appreciation and other, partially offset by net outflows, distributions and a negative impact of foreign currency translation. Global retail net outflows of $3.9 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 included $1.9 billion of outflows from the Columbia Acorn® Fund, $0.6 billion of outflows from former parent-related assets (includes $0.1 billion of outflows from the Columbia Acorn® Fund), $1.3 billion of outflows of our variable product funds underlying insurance and annuity separate accounts and UK and European net outflows of $1.3 billion, partially offset by reinvested dividends and inflows of $1.0 billion related to the EGA acquisition. Global institutional AUM decreased $6.2 billion, or 3%, during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 due to net outflows of $12.6 billion and an $8.5 billion negative impact of foreign currency translation, partially offset by market appreciation and other. Global institutional net outflows included $0.5 billion of outflows related to a CLO unwind, $0.7 billion from the termination of a former subadvisor and $7.4 billion of outflows of former parent-related assets, of which $4.0 billion was driven by changes made to individually managed accounts by a former affiliated distribution partner.

Net RevenuesNet revenues, which exclude net realized investment gains or losses, decreased $218 million, or 9%, to $2.2 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $2.4 billion for the prior year period primarily due to lower management and financial advice fees.81AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. Management and financial advice fees decreased $200 million, or 10%, to $1.8 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $2.0 billion for the prior year period primarily due to lower asset-based fees driven by a decrease in average AUM, as well as a $16 million decrease in performance fees. Average AUM decreased $38.6 billion, or 8%, compared to the prior year period due to net outflows, equity market depreciation and the negative impact of foreign currency translation. Our average weighted equity index decreased 3% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the prior year period. ExpensesTotal expenses decreased $102 million, or 6%, to $1.8 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $1.9 billion for the prior year period due to a $64 million decrease in distribution expenses from lower retail fund assets and a decrease in general and administrative expense.General and administrative expense decreased $36 million, or 4%, to $960 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $996 million for the prior year period primarily due to an $8 million decrease in compensation related to lower performance fees, a benefit from the impact of foreign exchange and lower investment spending, partially offset by a $9 million expense from the resolution of a legacy legal matter related to the hedge fund business.

The impact on DAC, DSIC and reserves for insurance features in non-traditional long-duration contracts from actual versus expected market performance based on our view of bond and equity performance was a benefit of $5 million ($3 million for DAC, $1 million for DSIC and $1 million for insurance features in non-traditional long duration contracts) for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 reflecting favorable equity market and bond fund returns compared to a net expense of $19 million ($19 million for DAC, $5 million for DSIC and a $5 million benefit for insurance features in non-traditional long duration contracts) for the prior year period reflecting unfavorable equity market and bond fund returns. 82AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. RiverSource variable annuity account balances increased 4% to $75.9 billion at September 30, 2016 compared to the prior year period due to equity market appreciation, partially offset by net outflows of $1.7 billion. RiverSource fixed annuity account balances declined 7% to $10.2 billion at September 30, 2016 compared to the prior year period as older policies continue to lapse and new sales are limited due to low interest rates. Given the current interest rate environment, our current fixed annuity book is expected to gradually run off and earnings on our fixed annuity business will trend down.Net RevenuesNet revenues, which exclude net realized investment gains or losses, decreased $68 million, or 4%, to $1.8 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $1.9 billion for the prior year period primarily due to lower management and financial advice fees and net investment income, partially offset by higher other revenues.Management and financial advice fees decreased $20 million, or 4%, to $549 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $569 million for the prior year period due to lower fees on variable annuities driven by lower average separate account balances. Average variable annuity account balances decreased $3.3 billion, or 5%, from the prior year period due to net outflows and equity market depreciation.Net investment income, which excludes net realized investment gains or losses, decreased $74 million, or 11%, to $573 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $647 million for the prior year period reflecting a decrease of approximately $44 million from lower invested assets primarily due to fixed annuity net outflows and approximately $30 million from lower interest rates.Other revenues increased $28 million, or 8%, to $375 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $347 million for the prior year period due to higher fees from variable annuity guarantee sales in the prior year where the fees start on the first anniversary date and higher average fee rates.ExpensesTotal expenses, which exclude the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits (net of hedges and the related DSIC and DAC amortization) and the DAC and DSIC offset to net realized investment gains or losses, increased $228 million, or 16%, to $1.6 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $1.4 billion for the prior year period primarily due to the impact of unlocking.Distribution expenses decreased $19 million, or 6%, to $316 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $335 million for the prior year period due to lower variable annuity compensation driven by lower sales and lower average separate account balances. Interest credited to fixed accounts decreased $17 million, or 5%, to $360 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $377 million for the prior year period driven by lower average fixed annuity account balances, partially offset by higher average variable annuities fixed sub-account balances. Average fixed annuity account balances decreased $1.0 billion, or 9%, to $10.4 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the prior year period as older policies continue to lapse and new sales are limited due to low interest rates. Average variable annuities fixed sub-account balances increased $149 million, or 3%, to $5.0 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the prior year period.Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses, which exclude the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits (net of hedges and the related DSIC amortization) and the DSIC offset to net realized investment gains or losses, increased $289 million, or 85%, to $628 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $339 million for the prior year period primarily reflecting the following items: •Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 included a $197 million expense from unlocking primarily reflecting continued low interest rates and an unfavorable impact from persistency on living benefit reserves, partially offset by a benefit from updates to withdrawal utilization and fee assumptions, as well as market-related inputs related to our living benefit valuation. Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses for the prior year period included a $61 million benefit from unlocking primarily reflecting an update to market-related inputs related to our living benefit valuation and a benefit from model changes that more than offset the difference between our previously assumed interest rates versus the low interest rate environment. •An $18 million increase in expense related to higher reserve funding driven by the impact of higher fees from variable annuity guarantee sales in the prior year where the fees start on the first anniversary date.83AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC.

Other revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 included a $64 million favorable impact from unlocking compared to a $5 million unfavorable impact in the prior year period. The primary driver of the unlocking impact to other revenues for the current year period was a positive impact from higher projected gains on reinsurance contracts resulting from unfavorable mortality experience. The primary driver of the unlocking impact to other revenues for the prior year period was a positive impact from model updates related to our indexed universal life product, partially offset by a negative impact from lower projected gains on reinsurance contracts resulting from favorable mortality experience.ExpensesTotal expenses, which exclude the market impact on indexed universal life benefits (net of hedges and the related DAC amortization) and the DAC offset to net realized investment gains or losses, increased $146 million, or 9%, to $1.8 billion for the nine months ended 84AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. September 30, 2016 compared to $1.6 billion for the prior year period primarily due to the impact of unlocking, a $29 million increase in LTC reserves from a correction related to our claim utilization assumption in the third quarter of 2016 and higher catastrophe losses.Distribution expenses decreased $30 million, or 73%, to $11 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $41 million for the prior year period primarily due to a $27 million benefit related to the write-off of the deferred reinsurance liability in connection with loss recognition testing of LTC insurance products in the third quarter of 2016.Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses increased $102 million, or 9%, to $1.2 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $1.1 billion for the prior year period primarily due to the impact of unlocking, higher catastrophe losses and a $29 million increase in LTC reserves from a correction related to our claim utilization assumption in the third quarter of 2016. The unlocking impact for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $46 million and primarily reflected continued low interest rates and unfavorable mortality experience. The impact of unlocking for the prior year period was $6 million. Catastrophe losses were $89 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $65 million for the prior year period. Amortization of DAC increased $49 million, or 40%, to $170 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $121 million for the prior year period primarily due to the impact of unlocking. The impact of unlocking was an expense of $65 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to an expense of $10 million for the prior year period. The unlocking impact for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 primarily reflected the DAC write-off of $58 million in connection with the loss recognition on LTC insurance products due to continued low interest rates, higher morbidity and higher reinsurance expenses, slightly offset by premium increases. The unlocking impact for the prior year period was primarily driven by the difference between our previously assumed interest rates versus the low interest rate environment.General and administrative expense increased $16 million, or 9%, to $204 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $188 million for the prior year period primarily due to an increase in staff and investments in our auto and home business.Corporate & OtherThe following table presents the results of operations of our Corporate & Other segment on an operating basis: Nine Months Ended September 30, Change 2016 2015 (in millions)  Revenues       Net investment loss$(23) $(22) $(1) (5)%Other revenues4 10 (6) (60)Total revenues(19) (12) (7) (58)Banking and deposit interest expense1 — 1 —Total net revenues(20) (12) (8) (67)Expenses       Interest and debt expense14 12 2 17General and administrative expense164 137 27 20Total expenses178 149 29 19Operating loss$(198) $(161) $(37) (23)%Our Corporate & Other segment pretax operating loss excludes net realized investment gains or losses, the market impact of hedges to offset interest rate changes on unrealized gains or losses for certain investments, integration and restructuring charges, and the impact of consolidating CIEs. Our Corporate & Other segment pretax operating loss increased $37 million, or 23%, to $198 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $161 million for the prior year period primarily due to a decrease in other revenues and an increase in general and administrative expense. Other revenues decreased $6 million, or 60%, to $4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $10 million for the prior year period due to a $4 million loss on the sale of real estate in second quarter of 2016 and a $7 million gain on the sale of a building in the second quarter of 2015.General and administrative expense increased $27 million, or 20%, to $164 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $137 million for the prior year period primarily due to $19 million of incremental expense related to the planning and implementation of the new Department of Labor fiduciary standard and a $14 million expense from the resolution of a legacy legal matter related to the hedge fund business. 85AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. Market RiskOur primary market risk exposures are interest rate, equity price, foreign currency exchange rate and credit risk. Equity price and interest rate fluctuations can have a significant impact on our results of operations, primarily due to the effects they have on the asset management and other asset-based fees we earn, the spread income generated on our fixed annuities, fixed insurance, brokerage client cash balances, face-amount certificate products and the fixed portion of our variable annuities and variable insurance contracts, the value of DAC and DSIC assets, the value of liabilities for guaranteed benefits associated with our variable annuities and the value of derivatives held to hedge these benefits.Our earnings from fixed annuities, fixed insurance, and the fixed portion of variable annuities and variable insurance contracts are based upon the spread between rates earned on assets held and the rates at which interest is credited to accounts. We primarily invest in fixed rate securities to fund the rate credited to clients. We guarantee an interest rate to the holders of these products. Investment assets and client liabilities generally differ as it relates to basis, repricing or maturity characteristics. Rates credited to clients’ accounts generally reset at shorter intervals than the yield on the underlying investments. Therefore, in an increasing interest rate environment, higher interest rates may be reflected in crediting rates to clients sooner than in rates earned on invested assets, which could result in a reduced spread between the two rates, reduced earned income and a negative impact on pretax income. However, the current low interest rate environment is resulting in interest rates below the level of some of our liability guaranteed minimum interest rates (“GMIRs”). Hence, a modest rise in interest rates would not necessarily result in changes to all the liability credited rates while projected asset purchases would capture the full increase in interest rates. This dynamic would result in widening spreads under a modestly rising rate scenario given the current relationship between the current level of interest rates and the underlying GMIRs on the business. As a result of the low interest rate environment, our current reinvestment yields are generally lower than the current portfolio yield. We expect our portfolio income yields to continue to decline in future periods if interest rates remain low. The carrying value and weighted average yield of non-structured fixed maturity securities and commercial mortgage loans that may generate proceeds to reinvest through September 30, 2018 due to prepayment, maturity or call activity at the option of the issuer, excluding securities with a make-whole provision, were $4.1 billion and 4.2%, respectively, as of September 30, 2016. In addition, residential mortgage-backed securities, which are subject to prepayment risk as a result of the low interest rate environment, totaled $6.9 billion and had a weighted average yield of 2.7% as of September 30, 2016. While these amounts represent investments that could be subject to reinvestment risk, it is also possible that these investments will be used to fund liabilities or may not be prepaid and will remain invested at their current yields. In addition to the interest rate environment, the mix of benefit payments versus product sales as well as the timing and volumes associated with such mix may impact our investment yield. Furthermore, reinvestment activities and the associated investment yield may also be impacted by corporate strategies implemented at management’s discretion. The average yield for investment purchases during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was approximately 2.7%.The reinvestment of proceeds from maturities, calls and prepayments at rates below the current portfolio yield, which may be below the level of some liability GMIRs, will have a negative impact to future operating results. To mitigate the unfavorable impact that the low interest rate environment has on our spread income, we assess reinvestment risk in our investment portfolio and monitor this risk in accordance with our asset/liability management framework. In addition, we may reduce the crediting rates on our fixed products when warranted, subject to guaranteed minimums.In addition to the fixed rate exposures noted above, RiverSource Life also has the following variable annuity guarantee benefits: guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits (“GMWB”), guaranteed minimum accumulation benefits (“GMAB”), guaranteed minimum death benefits (“GMDB”) and guaranteed minimum income benefits (“GMIB”). Each of these guaranteed benefits guarantees payouts to the annuity holder under certain specific conditions regardless of the performance of the underlying invested assets.The variable annuity guarantees continue to be managed by utilizing a hedging program which attempts to match the sensitivity of the assets with the sensitivity of the liabilities. This approach works with the premise that matched sensitivities will produce a highly effective hedging result. Our comprehensive hedging program focuses mainly on first order sensitivities of assets and liabilities: Equity Market Level (Delta), Interest Rate Level (Rho) and Volatility (Vega). Additionally, various second order sensitivities are managed. We use various index options across the term structure, interest rate swaps and swaptions, total return swaps and futures to manage the risk exposures. The exposures are measured and monitored daily, and adjustments to the hedge portfolio are made as necessary.We have a macro hedge program to provide protection against the statutory tail scenario risk arising from variable annuity reserves on our statutory surplus and to cover some of the residual risks not covered by other hedging activities. We assess the residual risk under a range of scenarios in creating and executing the macro hedge program. As a means of economically hedging these risks, we use a combination of futures, options, interest rate swaptions and/or swaps. Certain of the macro hedge derivatives used contain settlement provisions linked to both equity returns and interest rates; the remaining are interest rate contracts or equity contracts. The macro hedge program could result in additional earnings volatility as changes in the value of the macro hedge derivatives, which are designed to reduce statutory capital volatility, may not be closely aligned to changes in the variable annuity guarantee embedded derivatives.To evaluate interest rate and equity price risk we perform sensitivity testing which measures the impact on pretax income from the sources listed below for a 12-month period following a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates or a hypothetical 10% 86AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. decline in equity prices. The interest rate risk test assumes a sudden 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve, with rates then staying at those levels for the next 12 months. The equity price risk test assumes a sudden 10% drop in equity prices, with equity prices then staying at those levels for the next 12 months. In estimating the values of variable annuity riders, equity indexed annuities, stock market certificates, indexed universal life insurance and the associated hedge assets, we assume no change in implied market volatility despite the 10% drop in equity prices.The following tables present our estimate of the impact on pretax income from the above defined hypothetical market movements as of September 30, 2016:  Equity Price Exposure to Pretax IncomeEquity Price Decline 10% Before Hedge Impact Hedge Impact Net Impact  (in millions)Asset-based management and distribution fees (1) $(232) $— $(232)DAC and DSIC amortization (2) (3) (136) — (136)Variable annuity riders:      GMDB and GMIB (3) (4) (35) — (35)GMWB (3) (4) (533) 412 (121)GMAB (42) 43 1DAC and DSIC amortization (5) N/A N/A (5)Total variable annuity riders (610) 455 (160)Macro hedge program (6) — 36 36Equity indexed annuities 1 (1) —Certificates 4 (4) —Indexed universal life insurance 45 (32) 13Total $(928) $454 $(479)  Interest Rate Exposure to Pretax IncomeInterest Rate Increase 100 Basis Points Before Hedge Impact Hedge Impact Net Impact  (in millions)Asset-based management and distribution fees (1) $(51) $— $(51)Variable annuity riders:      GMDB and GMIB — — —GMWB 1,315 (1,305) 10GMAB 41 (38) 3DAC and DSIC amortization (5) N/A N/A 1Total variable annuity riders 1,356 (1,343) 14Macro hedge program (6) — 1 1Fixed annuities, fixed insurance and fixed portion of variable annuities and variable insurance products 81 — 81Brokerage client cash balances 166 — 166Certificates (5) — (5)Indexed universal life insurance 73 1 74Total $1,620 $(1,341) $280N/A Not Applicable.(1) Excludes incentive income which is impacted by market and fund performance during the period and cannot be readily estimated.(2) Market impact on DAC and DSIC amortization resulting from lower projected profits.(3) In estimating the impact on DAC and DSIC amortization resulting from lower projected profits, we have not changed our assumed equity asset growth rates. This is a significantly more conservative estimate than if we assumed management follows its mean reversion guideline and increased near-term rates to recover the drop in equity values over a five-year period. We make this same conservative assumption in estimating the impact from GMDB and GMIB riders and the life contingent benefits associated with GMWB.(4) In the second quarter of 2016, we reclassified the estimated impact from certain reserves for life contingent benefits associated with GMWB provisions from the GMDB and GMIB line to the GMWB line. The estimated impact from these reserves as of December 31, 2015 was $(123) million.87AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. (5) Market impact on DAC and DSIC amortization related to variable annuity riders is modeled net of hedge impact.(6) The market impact of the macro hedge program is modeled net of any related impact to DAC and DSIC amortization.The above results compare to an estimated negative net impact to pretax income of $417 million related to a 10% equity price decline and an estimated positive net impact to pretax income of $170 million related to a 100 basis point increase in interest rates as of December 31, 2015. Net impacts shown in the above table from GMWB and GMAB riders result largely from differences between the liability valuation basis and the hedging basis. Liabilities are valued using fair value accounting principles, with risk margins incorporated in contractholder behavior assumptions and with discount rates increased to reflect a current market estimate of our risk of nonperformance specific to these liabilities. The nonperformance spread risk is not hedged.Actual results could differ materially from those illustrated above as they are based on a number of estimates and assumptions. These include assuming that implied market volatility does not change when equity prices fall by 10%, that management does not increase assumed equity asset growth rates to anticipate recovery of the drop in equity values when valuing DAC, DSIC and GMDB and GMIB liability values and that the 100 basis point increase in interest rates is a parallel shift of the yield curve. Furthermore, we have not tried to anticipate changes in client preferences for different types of assets or other changes in client behavior, nor have we tried to anticipate actions management might take to increase revenues or reduce expenses in these scenarios.The selection of a 100 basis point interest rate increase as well as a 10% equity price decline should not be construed as a prediction of future market events. Impacts of larger or smaller changes in interest rates or equity prices may not be proportional to those shown for a 100 basis point increase in interest rates or a 10% decline in equity prices.Fair Value MeasurementsWe report certain assets and liabilities at fair value; specifically, separate account assets, derivatives, embedded derivatives, properties held by our consolidated property funds, and most investments and cash equivalents. Fair value assumes the exchange of assets or liabilities occurs in orderly transactions and is not the result of a forced liquidation or distressed sale. We include actual market prices, or observable inputs, in our fair value measurements to the extent available. Broker quotes are obtained when quotes from pricing services are not available. We validate prices obtained from third parties through a variety of means such as: price variance analysis, subsequent sales testing, stale price review, price comparison across pricing vendors and due diligence reviews of vendors. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our fair value measurements.Fair Value of Liabilities and Nonperformance RiskCompanies are required to measure the fair value of liabilities at the price that would be received to transfer the liability to a market participant (an exit price). Since there is not a market for our obligations of our variable annuity riders and indexed universal life insurance, we consider the assumptions participants in a hypothetical market would make to reflect an exit price. As a result, we adjust the valuation of variable annuity riders and indexed universal life insurance by updating certain contractholder assumptions, adding explicit margins to provide for profit, risk and expenses, and adjusting the rates used to discount expected cash flows to reflect a current market estimate of our nonperformance risk. The nonperformance risk adjustment is based on observable market data adjusted to estimate the risk of our life insurance company subsidiaries not fulfilling these liabilities. Consistent with general market conditions, this estimate resulted in a spread over the LIBOR swap curve as of September 30, 2016. As our estimate of this spread widens or tightens, the liability will decrease or increase. If this nonperformance credit spread moves to a zero spread over the LIBOR swap curve, the reduction to net income would be approximately $421 million, net of DAC, DSIC, unearned revenue amortization, the reinsurance accrual and income taxes (calculated at the statutory tax rate of 35%), based on September 30, 2016 credit spreads.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesOverviewWe maintained substantial liquidity during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had $3.1 billion and $2.4 billion, respectively, in cash and cash equivalents excluding CIEs. We have additional liquidity available through an unsecured revolving credit facility for up to $500 million that expires in May 2020. Under the terms of the credit agreement, we can increase this facility to $750 million upon satisfaction of certain approval requirements. Available borrowings under this facility are reduced by any outstanding letters of credit. At September 30, 2016, we had no outstanding borrowings under this credit facility and had $1 million of outstanding letters of credit. Our credit facility contains various administrative, reporting, legal and financial covenants. We were in compliance with all such covenants at September 30, 2016. During the first quarter of 2016, we extinguished $16 million of our junior subordinated notes due 2066 in open market transactions and recognized a gain of less than $1 million. On June 1, 2016, we redeemed our remaining outstanding junior subordinated notes due 2066 at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal balance of the notes plus accrued and compounded interest.On August 11, 2016, we issued $500 million of unsecured senior notes due September 15, 2026, and incurred debt issuance costs of $4 million. Interest payments are due semi-annually in arrears on March 15 and September 15, commencing on March 15, 2017. The proceeds of the senior notes will be used for general corporate purposes.We enter into short-term borrowings, which may include repurchase agreements and Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) advances, to 88AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. reduce reinvestment risk. Short-term borrowings allow us to receive cash to reinvest in longer-duration assets, while paying back the short-term debt with cash flows generated by the fixed income portfolio. The balance of repurchase agreements at both September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was $50 million, which is collateralized with agency residential mortgage backed securities and commercial mortgage backed securities from our investment portfolio. Our subsidiary, RiverSource Life Insurance Company (“RiverSource Life”), is a member of the FHLB of Des Moines, which provides access to collateralized borrowings. As of both September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had $150 million of borrowings from the FHLB, which is collateralized with commercial mortgage backed securities. We believe cash flows from operating activities, available cash balances and our availability of revolver borrowings will be sufficient to fund our operating liquidity needs.Dividends from SubsidiariesAmeriprise Financial is primarily a parent holding company for the operations carried out by our wholly owned subsidiaries. Because of our holding company structure, our ability to meet our cash requirements, including the payment of dividends on our common stock, substantially depends upon the receipt of dividends or return of capital from our subsidiaries, particularly our life insurance subsidiary, RiverSource Life, our face-amount certificate subsidiary, Ameriprise Certificate Company (“ACC”), AMPF Holding Corporation, which is the parent company of our retail introducing broker-dealer subsidiary, Ameriprise Financial Services, Inc. (“AFSI”) and our clearing broker-dealer subsidiary, American Enterprise Investment Services, Inc. (“AEIS”), our Auto and Home insurance subsidiary, IDS Property Casualty Insurance Company (“IDS Property Casualty”), doing business as Ameriprise Auto & Home Insurance, our transfer agent subsidiary, Columbia Management Investment Services Corp., our investment advisory company, Columbia Management Investment Advisers, LLC, and Threadneedle Asset Management Holdings Sàrl. The payment of dividends by many of our subsidiaries is restricted and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to regulatory capital requirements.Actual capital and regulatory capital requirements for our wholly owned subsidiaries subject to regulatory capital requirements were as follows: Actual Capital Regulatory Capital RequirementsSeptember 30, 2016 December 31, 2015September 30, 2016 December 31, 2015 (in millions)RiverSource Life(1)(2)$3,751 $3,800 N/A $589RiverSource Life of NY(1)(2)337 333 N/A 44IDS Property Casualty(1)(3)736 684 215 214Ameriprise Insurance Company(1)(3)47 46 2 2ACC(4)(5)320 274 301 258Threadneedle Asset Management Holdings Sàrl(6)379 285 157 165Ameriprise National Trust Bank(7)27 36 10 10AFSI(3)(4)103 93 # #Ameriprise Captive Insurance Company(3)51 54 10 11Ameriprise Trust Company(3)28 27 23 22AEIS(3)(4)117 110 21 52RiverSource Distributors, Inc.(3)(4)15 15 # #Columbia Management Investment Distributors, Inc.(3)(4)17 17 # #N/A Not applicable.# Amounts are less than $1 million.(1) Actual capital is determined on a statutory basis.(2) Regulatory capital requirement is based on the statutory risk-based capital filing.(3) Regulatory capital requirement is based on the applicable regulatory requirement, calculated as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.(4) Actual capital is determined on an adjusted GAAP basis.(5) ACC is required to hold capital in compliance with the Minnesota Department of Commerce and SEC capital requirements.(6) Actual capital and regulatory capital requirements are determined in accordance with U.K. regulatory legislation. The regulatory capital requirements at September 30, 2016 represent calculations at December 31, 2015 of the rule based requirements, as specified by FCA regulations.(7) Ameriprise National Trust Bank is required to maintain capital in compliance with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency regulations and policies.In addition to the particular regulations restricting dividend payments and establishing subsidiary capitalization requirements, we take into account the overall health of the business, capital levels and risk management considerations in determining a dividend strategy for payments to our parent holding company from our subsidiaries, and in deciding to use cash to make capital contributions to our subsidiaries.During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the parent holding company received cash dividends or a return of capital from its subsidiaries of $1.3 billion (including $800 million from RiverSource Life) and contributed cash to its subsidiaries of $135 million 89AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. (including $75 million to IDS Property Casualty). During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the parent holding company received cash dividends or a return of capital from its subsidiaries of $1.3 billion (including $675 million from RiverSource Life) and contributed cash to its subsidiaries of $243 million (including $175 million to IDS Property Casualty).In 2009, RiverSource established an agreement to protect its exposure to Genworth Life Insurance Company (“GLIC”) for its reinsured LTC. In early July of 2016, substantial enhancements to this reinsurance protection agreement were finalized. The terms of these confidential provisions within the agreement have been shared, in the normal course of regular reviews, with our domiciliary regulator and rating agencies. Management believes that this agreement and offsetting non LTC legacy arrangements with Genworth will enable RiverSource to recover on all net exposure in the event of an insolvency of GLIC.Dividends Paid to Shareholders and Share Repurchases We paid regular quarterly dividends to our shareholders totaling $368 million and $355 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. On October 25, 2016, we announced a quarterly dividend of $0.75 per common share. The dividend will be paid on November 18, 2016 to our shareholders of record at the close of business on November 7, 2016.In April 2014, our Board of Directors authorized an expenditure of up to $2.5 billion for the repurchase of shares of our common stock through April 28, 2016, which was exhausted in the three months ended March 31, 2016. In December 2015, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase up to an additional $2.5 billion of our common stock through December 31, 2017. As of September 30, 2016, we had $1.3 billion remaining under our share repurchase authorization. We intend to fund share repurchases through existing working capital, future earnings and other customary financing methods. The share repurchase programs do not require the purchase of any minimum number of shares, and depending on market conditions and other factors, these purchases may be commenced or suspended at any time without prior notice. Acquisitions under the share repurchase programs may be made in the open market, through privately negotiated transactions or block trades or other means. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we repurchased a total of 13.7 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $93.11 per share.Cash FlowsCash flows of CIEs are reflected in our cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities, investing activities and financing activities. Cash held by CIEs is not available for general use by Ameriprise Financial, nor is Ameriprise Financial cash available for general use by its CIEs. As such, the operating, investing and financing cash flows of the CIEs have no impact to the change in cash and cash equivalents.Operating ActivitiesNet cash provided by operating activities decreased $198 million to $1.7 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $1.9 billion for the prior year period primarily due to higher cash outflows related to derivatives, as well as a decrease in cash from lower fee revenue net of related expenses.Investing ActivitiesOur investing activities primarily relate to our Available-for-Sale investment portfolio. Further, this activity is significantly affected by the net flows of our investment certificate, fixed annuity and universal life products reflected in financing activities.Net cash used by investing activities decreased $81 million to $366 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $447 million for the prior year period primarily due to an $871 million increase in net cash related to changes in investments of CIEs primarily reflecting the CIE deconsolidation, a $224 million increase in proceeds from sales, maturities and repayments of mortgage loans reflecting the sale of a portion of our consumer loans in the first quarter of 2016, a $93 million decrease in funding of mortgage loans and a $97 million increase in proceeds from sales, maturities, sinking fund payments and calls of Available-for-Sale securities, partially offset by a $1.3 billion increase in cash used for purchases of Available-for-Sale securities. Financing ActivitiesNet cash used in financing activities decreased $734 million to $568 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $1.3 billion for the prior year period. Net cash inflows related to investment certificates increased $479 million compared to the prior year period due to higher proceeds from additions, partially offset by higher maturities, withdrawals and cash surrenders. Cash outflows from surrenders and other benefits of policyholder account balances decreased $721 million compared to the prior year period. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we repaid the remaining $245 million of our junior subordinated notes due 2066. In the third quarter of 2016, we issued $500 million of unsecured senior notes due 2026. Net cash outflows related to noncontrolling interests decreased $117 million compared to the prior year period reflecting the CIE deconsolidation. Net cash outflows related to borrowings of CIEs was $134 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to net cash inflows of $1.2 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 primarily reflecting the CIE deconsolidation.Contractual CommitmentsThere have been no material changes to our contractual obligations disclosed in our 2015 10-K. 90AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC.
