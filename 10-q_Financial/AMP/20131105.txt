Item 1A Risk Factors” in our 2012 10-K and other factors as discussed herein.Equity price, credit market and interest rate fluctuations can have a significant impact on our results of operations, primarily due to the effects they have on the asset management and other asset-based fees we earn, the "spread" income generated on our fixed annuities, fixed insurance, deposit products and the fixed portion of variable annuities and variable insurance contracts, the value of deferred acquisition costs (“DAC”) and deferred sales inducement costs (“DSIC”) assets, the values of liabilities for guaranteed benefits associated with our variable annuities and the values of derivatives held to hedge these benefits.Earnings, as well as operating earnings, will continue to be negatively impacted by the ongoing low interest rate environment. In addition to continuing spread compression in our interest sensitive product lines, a sustained low interest rate environment may result in increases to our reserves and changes in various rate assumptions we use to amortize DAC and DSIC, which may negatively impact our operating earnings. For additional discussion on our interest rate risk, see Item 3. "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk."In the third quarter of the year, we conduct our annual review of insurance and annuity valuation assumptions relative to current experience and management expectations. To the extent that expectations change as a result of this review, we update valuation assumptions and the impact is reflected as part of our annual review of life insurance and annuity valuation assumptions and modeling changes (“unlocking”). The unlocking impact in the third quarter of 2013 primarily reflected the impact of expected higher interest rates and changes in assumed policyholder behavior. See our Consolidated and Segment Results of Operations sections below for the pretax impacts on our revenues and expenses attributable to unlocking and additional discussion of the drivers of the unlocking impact.In January 2013, we completed the conversion of our federal savings bank subsidiary, Ameriprise Bank, FSB, to a limited powers national trust bank, which conversion included changing the name of this subsidiary to Ameriprise National Trust Bank (references herein to “Ameriprise Bank” pertain to this same subsidiary whether before or after its conversion). In connection with this conversion, deposit-taking and credit-originating activities of Ameriprise Bank were terminated. In addition, Ameriprise Financial was deregistered by the Federal Reserve as a savings and loan holding company and will no longer be subject to supervision and regulation as such. We will continue to make available to our clients certain deposit and credit products via referral arrangements with respected third party financial institutions. The transition released approximately $375 million of 58Table of Contentsformerly required capital, which we have been using to repurchase shares during 2013. We estimate that the transition will reduce our annual earnings by approximately $60 million in 2013. At the enterprise level, we anticipate that the earnings per share impact will be neutralized by the end of 2013, as we redeploy the excess capital to shareholders through share repurchases. We consolidate certain collateralized debt obligations (“CDOs”) and other investment products (collectively, “investment entities”) for which we provide asset management services to and sponsor for the investment of client assets in the normal course of business. These entities are defined as consolidated investment entities (“CIEs”). For further information on CIEs, see Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Changes in the valuation of the CIE assets and liabilities impact pretax income. The net income (loss) of the CIEs is reflected in net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests. The results of operations of the CIEs are reflected in the Corporate & Other segment. On a consolidated basis, the management fees we earn for the services we provide to the CIEs and the related general and administrative expenses are eliminated and the changes in the assets and liabilities related to the CIEs, primarily debt and underlying syndicated loans, are reflected in net investment income. We continue to include the fees in the management and financial advice fees line within our Asset Management segment.While our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), management believes that operating measures, which exclude net realized gains or losses; the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits, net of hedges and the related DSIC and DAC amortization; the market impact on indexed universal life benefits, net of hedges and the related DAC amortization, unearned revenue amortization and the reinsurance accrual; integration and restructuring charges; income (loss) from discontinued operations; and the impact of consolidating CIEs, best reflect the underlying performance of our core operations and facilitate a more meaningful trend analysis. While the consolidation of the CIEs impacts our balance sheet and income statement, our exposure to these entities is unchanged and there is no impact to the underlying business results. Management uses certain of these non-GAAP measures to evaluate our financial performance on a basis comparable to that used by some securities analysts and investors. Also, certain of these non-GAAP measures are taken into consideration, to varying degrees, for purposes of business planning and analysis and for certain compensation-related matters. Throughout our Management’s Discussion and Analysis, these non-GAAP measures are referred to as operating measures. It is management’s priority to increase shareholder value over a multi-year horizon by achieving our on-average, over-time financial targets. Our financial targets are:•Operating total net revenue growth of 6% to 8%,•Operating earnings per diluted share growth of 12% to 15%, and•Operating return on equity excluding accumulated other comprehensive income of 15% to 18%. The following tables reconcile our GAAP measures to operating measures: Three Months Ended  September 30, Nine Months Ended  September 30, 2013 2012 2013 2012 (in millions)Total net revenues$2,813 $2,468 $8,253 $7,543Less: Revenue attributable to CIEs114 27 208 80Less: Net realized gains (losses)6 (68) 7 (75)Less: Market impact on indexed universal life benefits(2) — (3) —Less: Integration/restructuring charges— (8) — (8)Operating total net revenues$2,695 $2,517 $8,041 $7,54659Table of Contents     Per Diluted Share Three Months Ended  September 30, Three Months Ended  September 30, 2013 2012 2013 2012 (in millions, except per share amounts)Net income$449 $151    Less: Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests67 (22)    Net income attributable to Ameriprise Financial382 173 $1.86 $0.79Less: Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax1 (1) — —Net income from continuing operations attributable to Ameriprise Financial381 174 1.86 0.79Add: Integration/restructuring charges, net of tax (1)— 11 — 0.05Add: Market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits, net of tax (1)13 60 0.06 0.28Add: Market impact on indexed universal life benefits, net of tax (1)2 — 0.01 —Less: Net realized gains (losses), net of tax (1)4 (44) 0.02 (0.20)Operating earnings$392 $289 $1.91 $1.32        Weighted average common shares outstanding:       Basic201.3 215.0    Diluted205.1 219.1    (1) Calculated using the statutory tax rate of 35%.

Certain of our accounting and reporting policies are critical to an understanding of our consolidated results of operations and financial condition and, in some cases, the application of these policies can be significantly affected by the estimates, judgments and assumptions made by management during the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements. These accounting policies are discussed in detail in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis — Critical Accounting Policies” in our 2012 10-K.Deferred Acquisition Costs and Deferred Sales Inducement CostsA decrease of 100 basis points in various rate assumptions is likely to result in an increase in DAC and DSIC amortization and an increase in benefits and claims expense from variable annuity guarantees. The following table presents the estimated impact to current period pretax income: Estimated Impact to Pretax Income(1) (in millions)Decrease in future near and long-term fixed income returns by 100 basis points$(47)  Decrease in future near-term equity fund growth returns by 100 basis points$(36)Decrease in future long-term equity fund growth returns by 100 basis points(27)Decrease in future near and long-term equity fund growth returns by 100 basis points$(63)(1) An increase in the above assumptions by 100 basis points would result in an increase to pretax income for approximately the same amount.61Table of ContentsRecent Accounting Pronouncements For information regarding recent accounting pronouncements and their expected impact on our future consolidated results of operations and financial condition, see Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Assets Under Management and Administration Assets under management (“AUM”) include external client assets for which we provide investment management services, such as the assets of the Columbia funds and Threadneedle funds, assets of institutional clients and assets of clients in our advisor platform held in wrap accounts as well as assets managed by sub-advisers selected by us. AUM also includes certain assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets for which we provide investment management services and recognize management fees in our Asset Management segment, such as the assets of the general account and the variable product funds held in the separate accounts of our life insurance subsidiaries and client assets of CIEs. These assets do not include assets under advisement, for which we provide model portfolios but do not have full discretionary investment authority. Corporate & Other AUM primarily includes former bank assets that are managed within our Corporate & Other segment. Assets under administration (“AUA”) include assets for which we provide administrative services such as client assets invested in other companies’ products that we offer outside of our wrap accounts. These assets include those held in clients’ brokerage accounts. We generally record revenues received from administered assets as distribution fees. We do not exercise management discretion over these assets and do not earn a management fee. These assets are not reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. AUA also includes certain assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets for which we do not provide investment management services and do not recognize management fees, such as investments in non-affiliated funds held in the separate accounts of our life insurance subsidiaries. These assets do not include assets under advisement, for which we provide model portfolios but do not have full discretionary investment authority.

See our segment results of operations discussion below for additional information on changes in our AUM.62Table of ContentsConsolidated Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2013 and 2012  The following table presents our consolidated results of operations: Three Months Ended  September 30,   2013 2012 Change (in millions)  Revenues       Management and financial advice fees$1,318 $1,191 $127 11 %Distribution fees441 391 50 13Net investment income491 427 64 15Premiums324 309 15 5Other revenues247 161 86 53Total revenues2,821 2,479 342 14Banking and deposit interest expense8 11 (3) (27)Total net revenues2,813 2,468 345 14Expenses       Distribution expenses757 667 90 13Interest credited to fixed accounts204 207 (3) (1)Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses492 542 (50) (9)Amortization of deferred acquisition costs(14) 67 (81) NMInterest and debt expense68 68 — —General and administrative expense704 718 (14) (2)Total expenses2,211 2,269 (58) (3)%Income from continuing operations before income tax provision602 199 403 NMIncome tax provision154 47 107 NMIncome from continuing operations448 152 296 NMIncome (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax1 (1) 2 NMNet income449 151 298 NMLess: Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests67 (22) 89 NMNet income attributable to Ameriprise Financial$382 $173 $209 NMNM Not Meaningful.Overall Income from continuing operations before income tax provision increased $403 million to $602 million for the three months ended September 30, 2013 compared to $199 million for the prior year period primarily reflecting the impact of unlocking, the impact of market appreciation and wrap account net inflows, the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits (net of hedges and the related DSIC and DAC amortization), an increase in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and net realized losses on securities recognized in the prior year period, partially offset by the negative impact from spread compression in our interest sensitive product lines and asset management net outflows. The market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits (net of hedges and the related DSIC and DAC amortization) was an expense of $21 million for the third quarter of 2013, which included a $17 million benefit associated with unlocking. This compares to an expense of $91 million for the prior year period, which included a $10 million expense associated with unlocking. The negative impact on earnings from spread compression in our interest sensitive product lines was approximately $39 million pretax for the three months ended September 30, 2013 compared to the prior year period. 63Table of ContentsThe following table presents the total pretax impacts on our revenues and expenses attributable to unlocking for the three months ended September 30:Pretax Increase (Decrease) 2013 2012  (in millions)Other revenues $(18) $(41)     Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses (5) 30Amortization of DAC (79) 12Total expenses (84) 42Total (1) $66 $(83)(1) Includes a $17 million benefit and a $10 million expense related to the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits for the three months ended September 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively.Net Revenues Net revenues increased $345 million, or 14%, to $2.8 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2013 compared to $2.5 billion for the prior year period primarily due to higher management and financial advice fees, distribution fees, net investment income and other revenues. Management and financial advice fees increased $127 million, or 11%, to $1.3 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2013 compared to $1.2 billion for the prior year period primarily due to higher asset-based fees driven by an increase in average AUM, partially offset by $17 million of redemption-driven hedge fund performance fees in the prior year period, which was partially offset by $10 million of related compensation expense in general and administrative expense. Average AUM increased $37.4 billion, or 7%, compared to the prior year period primarily due to market appreciation and wrap account net inflows, partially offset by asset management net outflows. See our discussion on the changes in AUM in our segment results of operations section below.  Distribution fees increased $50 million, or 13%, to $441 million for the three months ended September 30, 2013 compared to $391 million for the prior year period due to higher client assets and increased client activity. Net investment income increased $64 million, or 15%, to $491 million for the three months ended September 30, 2013 compared to $427 million for the prior year period primarily due to net realized investment losses recognized in the prior year period and a $38 million increase in net investment income of CIEs, partially offset by a $52 million decrease in investment income on fixed maturity securities. The decrease in investment income on fixed maturity securities was primarily due to low interest rates and approximately $31 million of lower net investment income due to the sale of Ameriprise Bank’s investment portfolio as a result of the transition of banking operations in the fourth quarter of 2012. Net investment income for the third quarter of 2013 included net realized investment gains of $6 million compared to net realized investment losses of $68 million in the third quarter of 2012, primarily associated with the Ameriprise Bank transition. Other revenues increased $86 million, or 53%, to $247 million for the three months ended September 30, 2013 compared to $161 million for the prior year period due to the impact of unlocking, a $51 million increase in other revenues of CIEs and higher fees from variable annuity guarantees driven by higher volumes and higher fee rates. Other revenues for the third quarter of 2013 included an $18 million negative impact from unlocking compared to a $41 million negative impact in the prior year period. The primary driver of the unlocking impact to other revenues in both periods was lower projected gains on reinsurance contracts resulting from favorable mortality experience. Expenses Total expenses decreased $58 million, or 3%, to $2.2 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2013 compared to $2.3 billion for the prior year period primarily due to decreases in benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses and amortization of DAC, partially offset by an increase in distribution expenses. Distribution expenses increased $90 million, or 13%, to $757 million for the three months ended September 30, 2013 compared to $667 million for the prior year period driven by growth in assets under management. See our discussion on the changes in AUM in our segment results of operations section below.Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses decreased $50 million, or 9%, to $492 million for the three months ended September 30, 2013 compared to $542 million for the prior year period primarily reflecting the following items:•The three months ended September 30, 2013 included a $5 million benefit from unlocking, which included a $22 million benefit related to the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits, and the prior year period included a $30 million expense from unlocking, which included a $12 million expense related to the market impact on variable annuity 64Table of Contentsguaranteed living benefits. The market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits is discussed below. The unlocking impact for the three months ended September 30, 2013 reflected the impact of expected higher interest rates and changes in assumed policyholder behavior, partially offset by the impact of variable annuity model changes. The unlocking impact for the prior year period primarily reflected lower bond fund returns related to the life contingent benefits associated with GMWB.•An increase in expenses related to our auto and home business compared to the prior year period driven by growth in exposure due to a 34% increase in gross new policies and $10 million in higher catastrophe losses compared to the prior year period.•An increase in expenses of approximately $10 million related to higher reserve funding driven by the impact of higher fees from prior year sales with variable annuity guarantees.•A $48 million decrease in expense compared to the prior year period from the unhedged non-performance credit spread risk adjustment on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits.•A $44 million decrease in expense from other market impacts on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits, net of hedges in place to offset those risks and the related DSIC amortization. The $44 million decrease was the result of a favorable $7 million change in the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits reserves, a favorable $41 million change in the market impact on derivatives hedging the variable annuity guaranteed living benefits and an unfavorable $4 million DSIC offset. The main market drivers contributing to these changes are summarized below:•Interest rates were up for the third quarter of 2013 and down for the third quarter of 2012 resulting in a favorable change in the variable annuity guaranteed living benefits liability, partially offset by an unfavorable change in the related hedge assets. •Equity market and volatility impacts on the hedge assets for the third quarter of 2013 were a lower expense than the impacts for the third quarter of 2012, offset by the year over year corresponding liability result.•Other unhedged items including the difference between the assumed and actual underlying separate account investment performance, fixed income credit exposures, transaction costs and various behavioral items were a net unfavorable impact compared to the prior year period. Amortization of DAC decreased $81 million to a $14 million benefit for the three months ended September 30, 2013 compared to a $67 million expense for the prior year period due to the impact of unlocking, partially offset by the DAC offset to the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits (net of hedges and the related DSIC amortization). Amortization of DAC for the third quarter of 2013 included a $79 million benefit from unlocking, which included a $5 million expense related to the DAC offset to the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits, primarily driven by the impact of expected higher interest rates and changes in assumed policyholder behavior. Amortization of DAC for the third quarter of 2012 included a $12 million expense from unlocking, which included a $2 million benefit related to the DAC offset to the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits, primarily reflecting a decrease in income earned on assets due to the low interest rate environment compared to the interest credited to the contractholders, which in many instances are at their minimum guarantees, and lower bond fund growth rates, partially offset by a benefit from improved persistency and lowered mortality assumption. The DAC offset to the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits (net of hedges and the related DSIC amortization) was a benefit of $4 million for the third quarter of 2013 compared to a benefit of $26 million for the prior year period. General and administrative expense decreased $14 million, or 2%, to $704 million for the three months ended September 30, 2013 compared to $718 million for the prior year period primarily due to a $9 million decrease in integration and restructuring charges, $17 million of lower bank-related expenses, lower investment spending primarily associated with the completion of the brokerage platform conversion and lower expenses from re-engineering efforts, partially offset by higher compensation related accruals. Income Taxes Our effective tax rate on income from continuing operations including income attributable to noncontrolling interests was 25.5% for the three months ended September 30, 2013 compared to 23.8% for the prior year period. Our effective tax rate on income from continuing operations excluding income attributable to noncontrolling interests was 28.7% for the three months ended September 30, 2013 compared to 21.4% for the prior year period. The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2013 was lower than the statutory rate as a result of tax preferred items including the dividends received deduction, foreign tax credits and low income housing credits.  It is possible there will be corporate tax reform in the next few years. While impossible to predict, corporate tax reform is likely to include a reduction in the corporate tax rate coupled with reductions in tax preferred items. Potential tax reform may also affect the U.S. tax rules regarding international operations. Any changes could have a material impact on our income tax expense and deferred tax balances.65Table of ContentsResults of Operations by Segment for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2013 and 2012 Operating earnings is the measure of segment profit or loss management uses to evaluate segment performance. Operating earnings should not be viewed as a substitute for GAAP income from continuing operations before income tax provision. We believe the presentation of segment operating earnings as we measure it for management purposes enhances the understanding of our business by reflecting the underlying performance of our core operations and facilitating a more meaningful trend analysis. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the presentation of segment results and our definition of operating earnings.

Our advisors have access to a diversified selection of both affiliated and non-affiliated products to help clients meet their financial needs. A significant portion of revenues in this segment is fee-based, driven by the level of client assets, which is impacted by both market movements and net asset flows. We also earn net investment income on invested assets primarily from certificate products. This segment earns revenues (distribution fees) for distributing non-affiliated products and earns intersegment revenues (distribution fees) for distributing our affiliated products and services to our retail clients. Intersegment expenses for this segment include expenses for investment management services provided by the Asset Management segment. In addition to purchases of affiliated and non-affiliated mutual funds and other securities on a stand-alone basis, clients may purchase mutual funds, among other securities, in connection with investment advisory fee-based “wrap account” programs or services, and pay fees based on a percentage of their assets. In January 2013, we completed the conversion of our federal savings bank subsidiary, Ameriprise Bank to a limited powers national trust bank. In 2012, all checking, savings and money market accounts and certificates of deposit were liquidated and returned to our clients, Ameriprise Bank’s consumer loan portfolio, including first mortgages, home equity loans, home equity lines of credit and unsecured loans, was sold to affiliates of Ameriprise Bank, and Ameriprise Bank’s credit card account portfolio was sold to Barclays Bank Delaware (“Barclays”). See additional discussion on the transition and the impact to our business in the Overview section above.The following table presents the changes in wrap account assets and average balances for the three months ended September 30: 2013 2012 (in billions)Beginning balance$135.9 $113.4Net flows3.0 2.1Market appreciation and other5.2 5.1Ending balance$144.1 $120.6    Average balance (1)$140.0 $117.0(1) Average ending balances are calculated using a simple average of two quarters of data. Wrap account assets increased $8.2 billion, or 6%, during the three months ended September 30, 2013 due to net inflows of $3.0 billion and market appreciation and other of $5.2 billion. Wrap account net inflows increased $0.9 billion, or 43%, compared to the prior year period reflecting higher advisor productivity, experienced advisor recruiting and investor confidence. Average wrap account assets increased $23.0 billion, or 20%, compared to the prior year period due to net inflows and market appreciation.

The negative impact of lower spreads on cash sweep accounts and certificates was approximately $18 million compared to the prior year period. We expect there will continue to be earnings pressure from low short-term interest rates during the balance of the year. Pretax operating earnings for the three months ended September 30, 2012 included $16 million of earnings from former banking operations. Pretax operating margin was 14.2% for the three months ended September 30, 2013 compared to 12.4% for the prior year period. Net Revenues Net revenues exclude net realized gains or losses. Net revenues increased $113 million, or 12%, to $1.1 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2013 compared to $961 million for the prior year period reflecting retail client net inflows, market appreciation and increased client activity, partially offset by lower net revenues due to the transition of banking operations in the fourth quarter of 2012 and the negative impact of low interest rates. Net revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2012 included $33 million from former banking operations. Advice & Wealth Management delivered strong growth in assets and revenues through the combination of improved advisor productivity and experienced advisor recruiting. Operating net revenue per branded advisor was $110,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2013, up 12% from the prior year period driven by the combination of asset growth and strong client activity. Total branded advisors were 9,761 at September 30, 2013 compared to 9,815 at September 30, 2012. Management and financial advice fees increased $77 million, or 18%, to $515 million for the three months ended September 30, 2013 compared to $438 million for the prior year period driven by growth in wrap account assets. Average wrap account assets increased $23.0 billion, or 20%, to $140.0 billion at September 30, 2013 compared to the prior year period due to net inflows and market appreciation. See our discussion of the changes in wrap account assets above. Distribution fees increased $67 million, or 15%, to $519 million for the three months ended September 30, 2013 compared to $452 million for the prior year period primarily due to higher client assets and increased client activity. Net investment income, which excludes net realized gains or losses, decreased $32 million, or 51%, to $31 million for the three months ended September 30, 2013 compared to $63 million for the prior year period primarily due to the transition of banking operations in the fourth quarter of 2012, as well as a lower asset earnings rate on invested assets, partially offset by higher average certificate investment balances. Net investment income of former banking operations was $31 million for the three months ended September 30, 2012. 68Table of ContentsExpenses Total expenses increased $79 million, or 9%, to $921 million for the three months ended September 30, 2013 compared to $842 million for the prior year period due to an $88 million increase in distribution expenses driven by higher compensation due to strong growth in client assets, partially offset by a $9 million decrease in general and administrative expense primarily due to the transition of banking operations in the fourth quarter of 2012 and lower investment spending associated with the completion of the brokerage platform conversion, partially offset by higher performance-driven compensation accruals. General and administrative expense of former banking operations was $17 million for the three months ended September 30, 2012. Asset Management Our Asset Management segment provides investment advice and investment products to retail, high net worth and institutional clients. Such products and services are provided on a global scale through Columbia Management and Threadneedle. Columbia Management primarily provides U.S. domestic products and services and Threadneedle primarily provides international investment products and services. We provide clients with U.S. domestic individual products through unaffiliated third party financial institutions and through our Advice & Wealth Management segment, and we provide institutional products and services through our institutional sales force. International retail products are primarily distributed through third-party financial institutions and unaffiliated financial advisors. Individual products include mutual funds, exchange-traded funds and variable product funds underlying insurance and annuity separate accounts. Institutional asset management services are designed to meet specific client objectives and may involve a range of products, including those that focus on traditional asset classes, separately managed accounts, individually managed accounts, collateralized loan obligations, hedge funds, collective funds and property funds. Collateralized loan obligations and hedge funds are classified as alternative assets. Revenues in this segment are primarily earned as fees based on managed asset balances, which are impacted by market movements, net asset flows, asset allocation and product mix. We may also earn performance fees from certain accounts where investment performance meets or exceeds certain pre-identified targets. In addition to the products and services provided to third-party clients, management teams serving our Asset Management segment provide all intercompany asset management services for Ameriprise Financial subsidiaries. The fees for such services are reflected within the Asset Management segment results through intersegment transfer pricing. Intersegment expenses for this segment include distribution expenses for services provided by our Advice & Wealth Management, Annuities and Protection segments. On April 30, 2010, we completed the acquisition of the long-term asset management business of the Columbia Management Group from Bank of America. The acquisition significantly enhanced the capabilities of the Asset Management segment by increasing its scale, broadening its retail and institutional distribution capabilities and strengthening and diversifying its lineup of retail and institutional products. The integration of the Columbia Management business, which was completed in the second quarter of 2012, involved organizational changes to our portfolio management and analytical teams and to our operational, compliance, sales and marketing support staffs. This integration also involved the streamlining of our U.S. domestic product offerings. As a result of the integration, we combined RiverSource Investments, our legacy U.S. asset management business, with Columbia Management, under the Columbia brand. Total U.S. retail assets and number of funds under the Columbia brand as of September 30, 2013 were $230.6 billion and 210 funds, respectively. From time to time, fee waivers have been provided to the Columbia Money Market Funds (the “Funds”) by Columbia Management and certain other subsidiaries performing services for the Funds for the purposes of reducing the expenses charged to a Fund in a given period to maintain or improve a Fund’s net yield in that period. Our subsidiaries may enter into contractual arrangements with the Funds identifying the specific fees to be waived and/or expenses to be reimbursed, as well as the time period for which such waivers will apply. In aggregate, we voluntarily waived fees of $3 million for both the three months ended September 30, 2013 and 2012. Threadneedle remains our primary international investment management platform. Threadneedle manages eight OEICs and two Societe d’Investissement A Capital Variable (“SICAV”) offering. The eight OEICs are Threadneedle Investment Funds ICVC (“TIF”), Threadneedle Specialist Investment Funds ICVC (“TSIF”), Threadneedle Focus Investment Funds (“TFIF”), Threadneedle Portfolio Advantage Funds (“TPAF”), Threadneedle Investment Funds ICVC II (“TIF II”), Threadneedle Investment Funds ICVC III (“TIF III”), Threadneedle Investment Funds ICVC IV (“TIF IV”) and Threadneedle Opportunity Investment Funds ICVC (“TOIF”). TIF, TSIF, TFIF, TPAF, TIF II, TIF III, TIF IV and TOIF are structured as umbrella companies with a total of 70 (32, 14, 1, 2, 6, 8, 6 and 1, respectively) subfunds covering the world’s bond and equity markets. The SICAVs are the Threadneedle (Lux) SICAV (“T(Lux)”) and the Columbia Threadneedle SICAV-SIF (“SIF”). T(Lux) and SIF are structured as umbrella companies with a total of 32 (30 and 2, respectively) sub funds covering the world’s bond, commodities and equity markets. In addition, Threadneedle manages 13 unit trusts, 10 of which invest into the OEICs, 12 property unit trusts and one property fund of funds.69Table of Contents The following tables present the mutual fund performance of our retail Columbia and Threadneedle funds as of September 30:ColumbiaMutual Fund Rankings in top 2 Lipper Quartiles    2013 2012Domestic EquityEqual weighted 1 year 55% 54%   3 year 63% 47%   5 year 61% 57% Asset weighted 1 year 35% 64%   3 year 76% 69%   5 year 73% 72%        International EquityEqual weighted 1 year 47% 67%   3 year 41% 50%   5 year 56% 64% Asset weighted 1 year 22% 80%   3 year 26% 65%   5 year 81% 80%        Taxable Fixed IncomeEqual weighted 1 year 61% 70%   3 year 71% 65%   5 year 50% 74% Asset weighted 1 year 72% 72%   3 year 83% 80%   5 year 62% 81%        Tax Exempt Fixed IncomeEqual weighted 1 year 94% 85%   3 year 94% 95%   5 year 100% 95% Asset weighted 1 year 98% 77%   3 year 98% 86%   5 year 100% 99%        Asset Allocation FundsEqual weighted 1 year 62% 40%   3 year 70% 85%   5 year 80% 85% Asset weighted 1 year 65% 43%   3 year 85% 91%   5 year 92% 91%        Number of funds with 4 or 5 Morningstar star ratings  Overall 51 53   3 year 45 52   5 year 40 43        Percent of funds with 4 or 5 Morningstar star ratings  Overall 52% 47%   3 year 46% 46%   5 year 43% 41%        Percent of assets with 4 or 5 Morningstar star ratings  Overall 54% 66%   3 year 39% 47%   5 year 43% 43%Mutual fund performance rankings are based on the performance of Class Z fund shares for Columbia branded mutual funds.

Total segment AUM net outflows were $4.3 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2013. Management expects, consistent with prior patterns of outflows, that outflows of primarily low margin assets directly or indirectly affiliated with Threadneedle and Columbia former parent companies will continue for the foreseeable future. The overall impact to segment results is difficult to quantify due to uncertain timing, volume and mix of the outflows.  Columbia managed assets increased $9.8 billion, or 3%, during the three months ended September 30, 2013 primarily due to market appreciation, partially offset by net outflows. Total Columbia net outflows were $4.2 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2013. Columbia retail funds increased $7.3 billion, or 3%, during the three months ended September 30, 2013 74Table of Contentsprimarily due to market appreciation, partially offset by net outflows. Columbia retail net outflows of $3.3 billion in the third quarter of 2013 included $1.2 billion of outflows from a large distribution partner that continued to re-balance asset concentrations, $0.9 billion of continued outflows from a third party sub-advisor and $0.4 billion of outflows associated with a share class change in the Registered Investment Advisor (“RIA”) channel. Columbia institutional AUM increased $1.7 billion, or 2%, during the three months ended September 30, 2013 due to market appreciation, partially offset by net outflows of $0.8 billion primarily reflecting $1.2 billion of outflows in former parent influenced mandates and former parent affiliated distribution, some of which was low basis points, partially offset by new mandates funded in the quarter. Threadneedle managed assets increased $10.4 billion, or 8%, during the three months ended September 30, 2013 due to market appreciation and an $8.2 billion positive impact of foreign currency translation. Threadneedle retail funds increased $4.5 billion, or 11%, during the three months ended September 30, 2013 due to net inflows of $0.9 billion, market appreciation of $0.8 billion and a $2.7 billion positive impact of foreign currency translation. Threadneedle institutional AUM increased $6.0 billion, or 7%, during the three months ended September 30, 2013 primarily due to a $5.5 billion positive impact of foreign currency translation. Threadneedle institutional net outflows of $0.9 billion during the third quarter of 2013 reflected $0.9 billion of outflows largely from legacy insurance assets.Overall flows also reflected net outflows in fixed income portfolios, consistent with industry trends.The following table presents the results of operations of our Asset Management segment on an operating basis: Three Months Ended  September 30,     2013 2012 ChangeRevenues       Management and financial advice fees$655 $620 $35 6 %Distribution fees118 109 9 8Net investment income5 5 — —Other revenues— (1) 1 NMTotal revenues778 733 45 6Banking and deposit interest expense1 — 1 NMTotal net revenues777 733 44 6Expenses       Distribution expenses297 276 21 8Amortization of deferred acquisition costs5 4 1 25General and administrative expense297 298 (1) —Total expenses599 578 21 4Operating earnings$178 $155 $23 15 %NM Not Meaningful.Our Asset Management segment pretax operating earnings, which exclude net realized gains or losses and integration charges, increased $23 million, or 15%, to $178 million for the three months ended September 30, 2013 compared to $155 million for the prior year period reflecting equity market appreciation and expense management, partially offset by the impact of net outflows and redemption-driven hedge fund performance fees recognized in the third quarter of 2012.  Net Revenues Net revenues, which exclude net realized gains or losses, increased $44 million, or 6%, to $777 million for the three months ended September 30, 2013 compared to $733 million for the prior year period driven by asset growth from market appreciation and a shift to higher fee retail assets at Threadneedle, partially offset by the impact of net outflows. Management and financial advice fees increased $35 million, or 6%, to $655 million for the three months ended September 30, 2013 compared to $620 million for the prior year period primarily due to an increase in assets under management, as well as a shift to higher fee retail assets at Threadneedle.

Annuities Our Annuities segment provides variable and fixed annuity products of RiverSource Life companies to individual clients. We provide our variable annuity products through our advisors, and fixed annuity products are provided through both affiliated and unaffiliated advisors and financial institutions. Revenues for our variable annuity products are primarily earned as fees based on underlying account balances, which are impacted by both market movements and net asset flows. Revenues for our fixed annuity products are primarily earned as net investment income on assets supporting fixed account balances, with profitability significantly impacted by the spread between net investment income earned and interest credited on the fixed account balances. We also earn net investment income on owned assets supporting reserves for immediate annuities and for certain guaranteed benefits offered with variable annuities and on capital supporting the business. Intersegment revenues for this segment reflect fees paid by our Asset Management segment for marketing support and other services provided in connection with the availability of variable insurance trust funds (“VIT Funds”) under the variable annuity contracts. Intersegment expenses for this segment include distribution expenses for services provided by our Advice & Wealth Management segment, as well as expenses for investment management services provided by our Asset Management segment.

Results for the third quarter of 2013 also reflected new business growth and market appreciation, partially offset by fixed annuity spread compression. RiverSource variable annuity account balances increased 8% to $72.7 billion at September 30, 2013 compared to the prior year period due to market appreciation, partially offset by net outflows. Variable annuity net outflows of $154 million for the third quarter of 2013 reflected the closed book of annuities previously sold through third parties, partially offset by $88 million of net inflows in the Ameriprise channel. Variable annuity cash sales increased 14% compared to the prior year period. RiverSource fixed annuity account balances declined 4% to $13.4 billion at September 30, 2013 compared to the prior year period due to ongoing net outflows resulting from low client demand given the interest rate environment.Recently, we announced product feature and fee changes for our in-force variable annuities with living benefit guarantees to reflect the market environment, including providing policyholders with additional investment options designed to improve volatility management. Net Revenues Net revenues, which exclude net realized gains or losses, increased $22 million, or 3%, to $654 million for the three months ended September 30, 2013 compared to $632 million for the prior year period primarily due to higher management and financial advice fees and other revenues, partially offset by a decrease in net investment income. Management and financial advice fees increased $16 million, or 10%, to $179 million for the three months ended September 30, 2013 compared to $163 million for the prior year period due to higher fees on variable annuities driven by higher separate account balances. Average variable annuities contract accumulation values increased $5.5 billion, or 9%, compared to the prior year period due to market appreciation, partially offset by net outflows.Net investment income, which excludes net realized gains or losses, decreased $11 million, or 4%, to $265 million for the three months ended September 30, 2013 compared to $276 million for the prior year period primarily reflecting a decrease of approximately $3 million from lower invested assets due to net outflows and approximately $7 million from lower interest rates.Other revenues increased $16 million, or 20%, to $97 million for the three months ended September 30, 2013 compared to $81 million for the prior year period due to higher fees from variable annuity guarantees driven by higher volumes and higher fee rates. Expenses Total expenses, which exclude the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits (net of hedges and the related DSIC and DAC amortization) decreased $106 million, or 20%, to $435 million for the three months ended September 30, 2013 compared to $541 million for the prior year period primarily due to the impact of unlocking, as well as higher distribution expenses.  Distribution expenses increased $9 million, or 9%, to $107 million for the three months ended September 30, 2013 compared to $98 million for the prior year period primarily due to higher variable annuity compensation due to business growth and market appreciation. Interest credited to fixed accounts decreased $9 million, or 5%, to $164 million for the three months ended September 30, 2013 compared to $173 million for the prior year period driven by lower average fixed annuity account balances. Average fixed annuities contract accumulation values decreased $572 million, or 4%, to $13.5 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2013 compared to the prior year period due to net outflows. Fixed annuities remain in net outflows due to low client demand given the interest rate environment. Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses, which exclude the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits (net of hedges and the related DSIC amortization), increased $7 million, or 5%, to $150 million for the three months ended September 30, 2013 compared to $143 million for the prior year period due to higher reserves primarily related to the impact of higher fees from prior year sales with variable annuity guarantees, partially offset by the impact of unlocking. Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses for the third quarter of 2013 included a $21 million expense from unlocking primarily reflecting the impact of variable annuity model changes. Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses for the third quarter of 2012 77Table of Contentsincluded a $32 million expense from unlocking primarily reflecting lower bond fund returns related to liabilities for the life contingent benefits associated with GMWB.  Amortization of DAC, which excludes the DAC offset to the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits, decreased $113 million to a benefit of $41 million for the three months ended September 30, 2013 compared to a $72 million expense for the prior year period primarily due to the impact of unlocking. Amortization of DAC for the third quarter of 2013 included an $81 million benefit from unlocking primarily driven by the impact of expected higher interest rates and changes in assumed policyholder behavior. Amortization of DAC for the third quarter of 2012 included a $28 million expense from unlocking, primarily reflecting spread compression and lower bond fund growth rates, partially offset by a benefit from improved persistency.  Protection Our Protection segment offers a variety of products to address the protection and risk management needs of our retail clients including life, disability income and property-casualty insurance. Life and disability income products are primarily provided through our advisors. Our property-casualty products are sold primarily through affinity relationships. We issue insurance policies through our life insurance subsidiaries and the Property Casualty companies. The primary sources of revenues for this segment are premiums, fees and charges we receive to assume insurance-related risk. We earn net investment income on owned assets supporting insurance reserves and capital supporting the business. We also receive fees based on the level of assets supporting VUL separate account balances. This segment earns intersegment revenues from fees paid by our Asset Management segment for marketing support and other services provided in connection with the availability of VIT Funds under the VUL contracts. Intersegment expenses for this segment include distribution expenses for services provided by our Advice & Wealth Management segment, as well as expenses for investment management services provided by our Asset Management segment.

Premiums increased $18 million, or 6%, to $301 million for the three months ended September 30, 2013 compared to $283 million for the prior year period primarily due to growth in auto and home premiums driven by continued strong new policy sales growth across market segments, primarily from our affinity relationships with Costco and Progressive. Auto and home policy counts increased 10% year-over-year.Other revenues increased $20 million, or 30%, to $87 million for the three months ended September 30, 2013 compared to $67 million for the prior year period due to an $18 million unfavorable impact from unlocking in the third quarter of 2013 compared to a $41 million unfavorable impact in the prior year period. The primary driver of the unlocking impact to other revenues in both periods was lower projected gains on reinsurance contracts resulting from favorable mortality experience.Expenses Total expenses, which exclude the market impact on indexed universal life benefits (net of hedges and the related DAC amortization), increased $54 million, or 13%, to $461 million for the three months ended September 30, 2013 compared to $407 million for the prior year period primarily due to the impact of unlocking and higher expenses related to our auto and home business. Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses, which exclude the market impact on indexed universal life benefits (net of hedges), increased $35 million, or 12%, to $317 million for the three months ended September 30, 2013 compared to $282 million for the prior year period due to the impact of unlocking and higher expenses related to our auto and home business primarily due to growth in exposure due to a 34% increase in gross new policies and $10 million in higher catastrophe losses compared to the prior year period. The impact of unlocking was a $4 million benefit in the third quarter of 2013 compared to a $14 million benefit in the prior year period. The primary driver of the unlocking impact in both periods was favorable mortality experience.Amortization of DAC increased $9 million, or 53%, to $26 million for the three months ended September 30, 2013 compared to $17 million for the prior year period due to the impact of unlocking. The impact of unlocking was a $3 million benefit in the third quarter of 2013 compared to a $14 million benefit in the prior year period. The primary driver of the unlocking impact in both periods was a lower mortality assumption. 79Table of ContentsCorporate & Other Our Corporate & Other segment consists of net investment income or loss on corporate level assets, including excess capital held in our subsidiaries and other unallocated equity and other revenues as well as unallocated corporate expenses. The Corporate & Other segment also includes revenues and expenses of CIEs, which are excluded on an operating basis.

Our Corporate & Other segment pretax operating loss excludes net realized gains or losses, the impact of consolidating CIEs and restructuring charges. Our Corporate & Other segment pretax operating loss was $73 million for the three months ended September 30, 2013 compared to $57 million for the prior year period. Operating losses for the third quarter of 2013 included a loss of $10 million primarily due to how we offset accretion from an intercompany transfer of former bank assets. Approximately $8 million of this loss was reflected in net investment loss and approximately $2 million was reflected in general and administrative expense. The loss of $8 million in the Corporate & Other segment was offset by the associated incremental accretion income, primarily in the Annuities segment, that relates to the transfer of the bank assets and eliminates on a consolidated basis.80Table of ContentsConsolidated Results of Operations for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2013 and 2012  The following table presents our consolidated results of operations: Nine Months Ended  September 30,   2013 2012 Change (in millions)  Revenues       Management and financial advice fees$3,856 $3,475 $381 11 %Distribution fees1,323 1,189 134 11Net investment income1,431 1,430 1 —Premiums949 912 37 4Other revenues718 569 149 26Total revenues8,277 7,575 702 9Banking and deposit interest expense24 32 (8) (25)Total net revenues8,253 7,543 710 9Expenses       Distribution expenses2,243 1,996 247 12Interest credited to fixed accounts600 622 (22) (4)Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses1,391 1,456 (65) (4)Amortization of deferred acquisition costs153 197 (44) (22)Interest and debt expense194 209 (15) (7)General and administrative expense2,181 2,243 (62) (3)Total expenses6,762 6,723 39 1Income from continuing operations before income tax provision1,491 820 671 82Income tax provision395 248 147 59Income from continuing operations1,096 572 524 92Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax(1) (3) 2 67Net income1,095 569 526 92Less: Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests57 (71) 128 NMNet income attributable to Ameriprise Financial$1,038 $640 $398 62 %NM Not Meaningful.Overall Income from continuing operations before income tax provision increased $671 million, or 82%, to $1.5 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 compared to $820 million for the prior year period primarily reflecting the impact from unlocking and model changes, the impact of market appreciation and wrap account net inflows, the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits (net of hedges and the related DSIC and DAC amortization), an increase in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, a $30 million gain on the sale of Threadneedle's strategic business investment in Cofunds in the second quarter of 2013 and net realized losses on securities recognized in the prior year period, partially offset by the negative impact from spread compression in our interest sensitive product lines and asset management net outflows. The market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits (net of hedges and the related DSIC and DAC amortization) was an expense of $66 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2013, which included a $17 million benefit associated with unlocking. This compares to an expense of $220 million for the prior year period, which included a $12 million expense associated with unlocking and model changes. The negative impact on earnings from spread compression in our interest sensitive product lines was approximately $98 million pretax for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 compared to the prior year period. Results for the prior year period included a $40 million unfavorable impact from a tax-related item primarily related to an out-of-period correction in the second quarter of 2012.81Table of ContentsThe following table presents the total pretax impacts on our revenues and expenses attributable to unlocking and model changes for the nine months ended September 30:Pretax Increase (Decrease) 2013 2012  (in millions)Other revenues $(18) $(41)     Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses (5) 22Amortization of DAC (79) 14Interest credited to fixed accounts — 2Total expenses (84) 38Total (1) $66 $(79)(1) Includes a $17 million benefit and a $12 million expense related to the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively.Net Revenues Net revenues increased $710 million, or 9%, to $8.3 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 compared to $7.5 billion for the prior year period primarily due to higher management and financial advice fees, distribution fees and other revenues. Management and financial advice fees increased $381 million, or 11%, to $3.9 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 compared to $3.5 billion for the prior year period primarily due to higher asset-based fees driven by an increase in average AUM, as well as revenue enhancements related to various pricing adjustments, partially offset by $22 million of redemption-driven hedge fund performance fees in the prior year period, which was partially offset by $13 million of related compensation expense in general and administrative expense. Average AUM increased $32.1 billion, or 6%, compared to the prior year period primarily due to market appreciation and wrap account net inflows, partially offset by asset management net outflows. See our discussion on the changes in AUM in our segment results of operations section below. Distribution fees increased $134 million, or 11%, to $1.3 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 compared to $1.2 billion for the prior year period due to higher client assets and increased client activity. Net investment income was essentially flat compared to the prior year period reflecting a $30 million gain on the sale of Threadneedle’s investment in Cofunds in the second quarter of 2013, a $47 million increase in net investment income of CIEs and net realized losses on securities in the prior year period, partially offset by a $159 million decrease in investment income on fixed maturity securities. Net investment income for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 included net realized gains on securities of $7 million, compared to net realized losses on securities of $75 million in the prior year period, primarily associated with the transition of banking operations in the fourth quarter of 2012. The decrease in investment income on fixed maturity securities was primarily due to low interest rates and approximately $94 million of lower investment income due to the sale of Ameriprise Bank’s investment portfolio as a result of the transition of banking operations. Other revenues increased $149 million, or 26%, to $718 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 compared to $569 million for the prior year period due to the impact of unlocking, a $104 million increase in other revenues of CIEs and higher fees from variable annuity guarantees driven by higher volumes and higher fee rates. Other revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 included an $18 million negative impact from unlocking compared to a $41 million negative impact in the prior year period. The primary driver of the unlocking impact to other revenues in both periods was lower projected gains on reinsurance contracts resulting from favorable mortality experience. Expenses Total expenses increased $39 million, or 1%, to $6.8 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 compared to $6.7 billion for the prior year period primarily due to an increase in distribution expenses, partially offset by decreases in benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses, amortization of DAC and general and administrative expense. Distribution expenses increased $247 million, or 12%, to $2.2 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 compared to $2.0 billion for the prior year period driven by growth in assets under management. See our discussion on the changes in AUM in our segment results of operations section below. 82Table of ContentsInterest credited to fixed accounts decreased $22 million, or 4%, to $600 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 compared to $622 million for the prior year period driven by lower average fixed annuity account balances. Average fixed annuities contract accumulation values decreased $493 million, or 3%, to $13.6 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 compared to the prior year period due to net outflows. Fixed annuities remain in net outflows due to low client demand given the interest rate environment. Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses decreased $65 million, or 4%, to $1.4 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 compared to $1.5 billion for the prior year period primarily reflecting the following items:•The nine months ended September 30, 2013 included a $5 million benefit from unlocking, which included a $22 million benefit related to the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits, and the prior year period included a $22 million expense, which included a $15 million expense related to the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits. The market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits is discussed below. The unlocking impact for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 reflected the impact of expected higher interest rates and changes in assumed policyholder behavior, partially offset by the impact of variable annuity model changes. The unlocking impact for the prior year period primarily reflected lower bond fund returns related to the life contingent benefits associated with GMWB.•An increase in expenses related to our auto and home business compared to the prior year period driven by growth in exposure due to a 30% increase in gross new policies, increased reserves for auto liability loss development and $10 million in higher catastrophe losses compared to the prior year period.•An increase in expenses of approximately $30 million related to higher reserve funding driven by the impact of higher fees from prior year sales with variable annuity guarantees.•An $8 million increase in disability income reserves in the second quarter of 2013 related to prior periods and a $9 million benefit from a life insurance reserve release in the prior year period.•A $93 million increase in expense compared to the prior year period from the unhedged non-performance credit spread risk adjustment on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits.•A $293 million decrease in expense from other market impacts on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits, net of hedges in place to offset those risks and the related DSIC amortization. The $293 million decrease was the result of a favorable $835 million change in the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits reserves, partially offset by an unfavorable $530 million change in the market impact on derivatives hedging the variable annuity guaranteed living benefits and an unfavorable $12 million DSIC offset. The main market drivers contributing to these changes are summarized below:•Interest rates were up for the 2013 period and down for the 2012 period resulting in a favorable change in the variable annuity guaranteed living benefits liability, partially offset by an unfavorable change in the related hedge assets. •Equity market and volatility impacts on the hedge assets for the 2013 period were a lower expense than the impacts in the 2012 period, offset by the year over year corresponding liability result.•Other unhedged items including the difference between the assumed and actual underlying separate account investment performance, fixed income credit exposures, transaction costs and various behavioral items were a net favorable impact compared to the prior year period. Amortization of DAC decreased $44 million, or 22%, to $153 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 compared to $197 million for the prior year period primarily due to the impact of unlocking and model changes, partially offset by the DAC offset to the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits (net of hedges and the related DSIC amortization). Amortization of DAC for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 included a $79 million benefit from unlocking, which included a $5 million expense related to the DAC offset to the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits, primarily driven by the impact of expected higher interest rates and changes in assumed policyholder behavior. Amortization of DAC for the prior year period included a $14 million expense from unlocking and model changes, which included a $3 million benefit related to the DAC offset to the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits, primarily reflecting spread compression and lower bond fund growth rates, partially offset by a benefit from improved persistency and lowered mortality assumption. The DAC offset to the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits (net of hedges and the related DSIC amortization) was a benefit of $11 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 compared to a benefit of $57 million in the prior year period.   Interest and debt expense decreased $15 million, or 7%, to $194 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 compared to $209 million for the prior year period due to a decrease in interest expense on CIE debt. General and administrative expense decreased $62 million, or 3%, to $2.2 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 compared to the prior year period primarily due to a $55 million decrease in integration and restructuring charges, $29 million in 83Table of Contentslower expenses associated with the completion of the brokerage platform conversion, $49 million of lower bank-related expenses and lower expenses from re-engineering efforts, partially offset by a $20 million increase in expenses of CIEs, higher compensation related accruals and higher expenses from investments in the business. Income Taxes Our effective tax rate on income from continuing operations including income attributable to noncontrolling interests was 26.4% for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 compared to 30.3% for the prior year period. Our effective tax rate on income from continuing operations excluding income attributable to noncontrolling interests was 27.5% for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 compared to 27.9% for the prior year period. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 was lower than the statutory rate as a result of tax preferred items including the dividends received deduction, foreign tax credits and low income housing credits. The decrease in the effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 compared to the prior year period is primarily the result of a $32 million correction of tax related to securities lending activities in the prior year period.Results of Operations by Segment for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2013 and 2012  Operating earnings is the measure of segment profit or loss management uses to evaluate segment performance. Operating earnings should not be viewed as a substitute for GAAP income from continuing operations before income tax provision. We believe the presentation of segment operating earnings as we measure it for management purposes enhances the understanding of our business by reflecting the underlying performance of our core operations and facilitating a more meaningful trend analysis. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the presentation of segment results and our definition of operating earnings.

The negative impact of lower spreads on cash sweep accounts and certificates was approximately $43 million compared to the prior year period. Pretax operating earnings for the nine months ended September 30, 2012 included $49 million of earnings from former banking operations. Pretax operating margin was 13.8% for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 compared to 11.3% for the prior year period. Net Revenues Net revenues exclude net realized gains or losses. Net revenues increased $300 million, or 10%, to $3.2 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 compared to $2.9 billion for the prior year period reflecting retail client net inflows, market appreciation and increased client activity, partially offset by lower net revenues due to the transition of banking operations in the fourth quarter of 2012 and the negative impact of low interest rates. Net revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2012 included $99 million from former banking operations. Advice & Wealth Management delivered strong growth in assets and revenues through the combination of improved advisor productivity and experienced advisor recruiting. Operating net revenue per branded advisor was $324,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2013, up 11% from the prior year period driven by the combination of asset growth and strong client activity.  Management and financial advice fees increased $216 million, or 17%, to $1.5 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 compared to $1.3 billion for the prior year period driven by growth in wrap account assets.

See our discussion of the changes in wrap account assets above.Distribution fees increased $180 million, or 13%, to $1.6 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 compared to $1.4 billion for the prior year period primarily due to higher client assets and increased client activity. Net investment income, which excludes net realized gains or losses, decreased $97 million, or 51%, to $94 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 compared to $191 million for the prior year period due to $94 million of lower net investment income due to the transition of banking operations in the fourth quarter of 2012, as well as a lower asset earnings rate on invested assets, partially offset by higher average certificate investment balances.86Table of ContentsExpenses Total expenses increased $188 million, or 7%, to $2.7 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 compared to $2.5 billion for the prior year period due to a $239 million increase in distribution expenses driven by higher compensation due to strong growth in client assets, partially offset by a $51 million decrease in general and administrative expense primarily due to $49 million of lower expenses from the transition of banking operations in the fourth quarter of 2012 and $29 million of lower expenses associated with the completion of the brokerage platform conversion, partially offset by higher performance-driven compensation accruals. Asset Management In aggregate, we voluntarily waived fees to the Funds of $9 million and $8 million for the nine months ended9/30/2013 and 2012, respectively.

Management expects, consistent with prior patterns of outflows, that outflows of primarily low margin assets directly or indirectly affiliated with Threadneedle and Columbia former parent companies will continue for the foreseeable future. The overall impact to segment results is difficult to quantify due to uncertain timing, volume and mix of the outflows. 89Table of ContentsColumbia managed assets increased $14.6 billion, or 4%, during the nine months ended September 30, 2013 due to market appreciation, partially offset by net outflows of $11.8 billion. Columbia retail funds increased $14.3 billion, or 7%, during the nine months ended September 30, 2013 due to market appreciation, partially offset by net outflows. Columbia retail net outflows of $6.7 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 included outflows from a large distribution partner that continued to re-balance asset concentrations, continued outflows from a third party sub-advisor and outflows associated with a share class change in the RIA channel. Columbia institutional AUM increased $0.4 billion, or 1%, during the nine months ended September 30, 2013 due to market appreciation, partially offset by net outflows. Columbia institutional net outflows of $4.6 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 primarily reflected outflows in former parent influenced mandates and former parent affiliated distribution, some of which was low basis points, as well as first quarter outflows in investment grade and high yield credit mandates given strong performance in these asset classes, partially offset by new mandates funded in 2013.Threadneedle managed assets increased $9.6 billion, or 8%, during the nine months ended September 30, 2013 primarily due to market appreciation. Threadneedle retail funds increased $7.2 billion, or 18%, during the nine months ended September 30, 2013 due to market appreciation and net inflows of $3.2 billion. Threadneedle retail fund net inflows for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 were driven by recovering consumer confidence and good sales in key areas such as Europe. Threadneedle institutional AUM increased $2.7 billion, or 3%, due to market appreciation, partially offset by net outflows. Threadneedle institutional net outflows of $3.4 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 primarily reflected $3.8 billion of outflows from legacy insurance assets, including $1.0 billion from a Japanese mandate, partially offset by new mandate funding and additional flows into existing funds.

Net Revenues Net revenues, which exclude net realized gains or losses, increased $194 million, or 9%, to $2.3 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 compared to $2.2 billion for the prior year period driven by an increase in management and financial advice fees and higher net investment income.90Table of Contents Management and financial advice fees increased $146 million, or 8%, to $1.9 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 compared to $1.8 billion for the prior year period primarily due to an increase in assets under management, as well as a shift to higher fee retail assets at Threadneedle, revenue enhancements related to various pricing adjustments and $17 million of performance based incentive fees on a CDO unwind, partially offset by $22 million of redemption-driven hedge fund performance fees recognized in the prior year period. Average assets under management increased 3% compared to the prior year period driven by equity market appreciation, partially offset by net outflows. See our discussion above on the changes in assets under management. Net investment income, which excludes net realized gains or losses, increased $38 million to $50 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 compared to $12 million for the prior year period due to a $30 million gain on the sale of Threadneedle’s strategic business investment in Cofunds, as well as a $10 million residual gain on a CDO unwind. Expenses Total expenses, which exclude integration charges, increased $89 million, or 5%, to $1.8 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 compared to $1.7 billion for the prior year period primarily due to a $64 million increase in distribution expenses driven by higher retail fund assets and a $24 million increase in general and administrative expense driven by higher performance-based compensation, including $8 million of higher compensation related to a CDO unwind, and investments in the business, partially offset by re-engineering benefits and $13 million of expense in the prior year period related to redemption-driven hedge fund performance fees.

Variable annuity net outflows of $482 million for the nine months ended9/30/2013 reflected the closed book of annuities previously sold through third parties, partially offset by $263 million of net inflows in the Ameriprise channel. RiverSource fixed annuity account balances declined 4% to $13.4 billion at September 30, 2013 compared to the prior year period due to ongoing net outflows resulting from low client demand given the interest rate environment. Net Revenues Net revenues, which exclude net realized gains or losses, increased $37 million, or 2%, to $1.9 billion for the nine months ended9/30/2013 compared to the prior year period primarily due to higher management and financial advice fees and other revenues, partially offset by a decrease in net investment income. Management and financial advice fees increased $41 million, or 9%, to $523 million for the nine months ended9/30/2013 compared to $482 million for the prior year period due to higher fees on variable annuities driven by higher separate account balances. Average variable annuities contract accumulation values increased $5.4 billion, or 9%, from the prior year period due to market appreciation, partially offset by net outflows. Distribution fees increased $16 million, or 7%, to $252 million for the nine months ended9/30/2013 compared to $236 million for the prior year period primarily due to higher fees on variable annuities driven by higher separate account balances. Net investment income, which excludes net realized gains or losses, decreased $55 million, or 6%, to $801 million for the nine months ended9/30/2013 compared to $856 million for the prior year period reflecting a decrease of approximately $26 million from lower invested assets due to net outflows and approximately $25 million from lower interest rates. Premiums decreased $9 million, or 10%, to $81 million for the nine months ended9/30/2013 compared to $90 million for the prior year period due to lower sales of immediate annuities with life contingencies.Other revenues increased $44 million, or 20%, to $268 million for the nine months ended9/30/2013 compared to $224 million for the prior year period due to higher fees from variable annuity guarantees driven by higher volumes and higher fee rates. Expenses Total expenses, which exclude the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits (net of hedges and the related DSIC and DAC amortization) decreased $66 million, or 4%, to $1.4 billion for the nine months ended9/30/2013 compared to $1.5 billion for the prior year period primarily due to the impact of unlocking and model changes. Distribution expenses increased $22 million, or 7%, to $317 million for the nine months ended9/30/2013 compared to $295 million for the prior year period primarily due to higher variable annuity compensation due to business growth and market appreciation. Interest credited to fixed accounts decreased $28 million, or 5%, to $490 million for the nine months ended9/30/2013 compared to $518 million for the prior year period driven by lower average fixed annuity account balances. Average fixed annuities contract accumulation values decreased $493 million, or 3%, to $13.6 billion for the nine months ended9/30/2013 compared to the prior year period due to outflows. Fixed annuities remain in net outflows due to low client demand given the interest rate environment.

Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses for the nine months ended9/30/2013 included a $21 million expense from unlocking primarily reflecting the impact of variable annuity model changes. Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses for the prior year period included a $21 million expense from unlocking and model 92Table of Contentschanges primarily reflecting lower bond fund returns related to liabilities for the life contingent benefits associated with GMWB. Amortization of DAC, which excludes the DAC offset to the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits, decreased $97 million, or 60%, to $66 million for the nine months ended9/30/2013 compared to $163 million for the prior year period due to the impact of unlocking and model changes, partially offset by the market impact on DAC. Amortization of DAC for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 included an $81 million benefit from unlocking primarily driven by the impact of expected higher interest rates and changes in assumed policyholder behavior. Amortization of DAC for the prior year period included a $31 million expense from unlocking and model changes primarily reflecting spread compression and lower bond fund growth rates, partially offset by a benefit from improved persistency. The market impact on DAC was a benefit of $12 million for the nine months ended9/30/2013 compared to a benefit of $21 million in the prior year period.

Premiums increased $46 million, or 6%, to $880 million for the nine months ended9/30/2013 compared to $834 million for the prior year period primarily due to growth in auto and home premiums driven by continued strong new policy sales growth across market segments, primarily from our affinity relationships with Costco and Progressive. Auto and home policy counts increased 10% year-over-year.Other revenues increased $19 million, or 7%, to $301 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 compared to $282 million for the prior year period due to an $18 million unfavorable impact from unlocking for the nine months ended9/30/2013 compared to a $41 million unfavorable impact in the prior year period. The primary driver of the unlocking impact to other revenues in both periods was lower projected gains on reinsurance contracts resulting from favorable mortality experience. Expenses Total expenses, which exclude the market impact on indexed universal life benefits (net of hedges and the related DAC amortization), increased $101 million, or 8%, to $1.3 billion for the nine months ended9/30/2013 compared to $1.2 billion for the prior year period primarily due to an increase in benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses.Distribution expenses increased $7 million, or 14%, to $56 million for the nine months ended9/30/2013 compared to $49 million for the prior year period driven by higher sales.Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses, which exclude the market impact on indexed universal life benefits (net of hedges), increased $81 million, or 10%, to $918 million for the nine months ended9/30/2013 compared to $837 million for the prior year period due to the impact of unlocking, higher expenses related to our auto and home business, an $8 million increase in disability income reserves in the second quarter of 2013 related to prior periods and a $9 million benefit from a life insurance reserve release in the prior year period. The increase in expenses related to our auto and home business compared to the prior year period was driven by growth in exposure due to a 30% increase in gross new policies, increased reserves for auto liability loss development and $10 million in higher catastrophe losses compared to the prior year period. Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 included a $4 million benefit from unlocking compared to a $14 million benefit for the prior year period. The primary driver of the unlocking impact in both periods was favorable mortality experience.Amortization of DAC increased $7 million, or 9%, to $86 million for the nine months ended9/30/2013 compared to $79 million for the prior year period due to the impact of unlocking. The impact of unlocking was a $3 million benefit for the nine months ended9/30/2013 compared to a $14 million benefit in the prior year period. The primary driver of the unlocking impact in both periods was a lower mortality assumption.94Table of ContentsCorporate & Other The following table presents the results of operations of our Corporate & Other segment on an operating basis: Nine Months Ended  September 30,     2013 2012 Change (in millions)  Revenues       Management and financial advice fees$— $(1) $1 NMDistribution fees1 — 1 NMNet investment income (loss)(18) 13 (31) NMOther revenues5 8 (3) (38)%Total revenues(12) 20 (32) NMBanking and deposit interest expense— — — NMTotal net revenues(12) 20 (32) NMExpenses       Distribution expenses1 — 1 NMInterest and debt expense75 70 5 7General and administrative expense151 139 12 9Total expenses227 209 18 9Operating loss$(239) $(189) $(50) (26)%NM Not Meaningful.Our Corporate & Other segment pretax operating loss excludes net realized gains or losses, the impact of consolidating CIEs and restructuring charges. Our Corporate & Other segment pretax operating loss was $239 million for the nine months ended9/30/2013 compared to $189 million for the prior year period. Operating losses for the nine months ended9/30/2013 included a loss of $31 million primarily due to how we offset accretion from an intercompany transfer of former bank assets. Approximately $24 million of this loss was reflected in net investment loss and approximately $7 million was reflected in general and administrative expense. The loss of $24 million in the Corporate & Other segment was offset by the associated incremental accretion income, primarily in the Annuities segment, that relates to the transfer of the bank assets and eliminates on a consolidated basis. Corporate & Other segment results for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 also reflected higher compensation-related accruals, $6 million of lower losses on affordable housing partnerships and $5 million of higher interest and debt expense compared to the prior year period. Market Risk Our primary market risk exposures are interest rate, equity price, foreign currency exchange rate and credit risk. Equity price and interest rate fluctuations can have a significant impact on our results of operations, primarily due to the effects they have on the asset management and other asset-based fees we earn, the spread income generated on our fixed annuities, fixed insurance, brokerage client cash balances, face amount certificate products and the fixed portion of our variable annuities and variable insurance contracts, the value of DAC and DSIC assets, the value of liabilities for guaranteed benefits associated with our variable annuities and the value of derivatives held to hedge these benefits.Our earnings from fixed annuities, fixed insurance, and the fixed portion of variable annuities and variable insurance contracts are based upon the spread between rates earned on assets held and the rates at which interest is credited to accounts. We guarantee an interest rate to the holders of these products. We primarily invest in fixed rate securities to fund the rate credited to clients. As a result of the low interest rate environment, our current reinvestment yields are generally lower than the current portfolio yield. We expect our portfolio income yields to continue to decline in future periods if interest rates remain low. The carrying value and weighted average yield of non-structured fixed maturity securities and commercial mortgage loans that may generate proceeds to reinvest through 2015 due to prepayment, maturity or call activity at the option of the issuer, excluding securities with a make-whole provision, was $4.4 billion and 4.3%, respectively, as of September 30, 2013. In addition, residential mortgage-backed securities, which are subject to prepayment risk as a result of the low interest rate environment, totaled $5.9 billion and had a weighted average yield of 3.6% as of September 30, 2013.95Table of ContentsThe reinvestment of proceeds from maturities, calls and prepayments at rates below the current portfolio yield, which may be below the level of some liability guaranteed minimum interest rates, will have a negative impact to future operating results. To mitigate the unfavorable impact that the low interest rate environment has on our spread income, we assess reinvestment risk in our investment portfolio and monitor this risk in accordance with our asset/liability management framework. In addition, we may reduce the crediting rates on our fixed products when warranted, subject to guaranteed minimums. The following table presents the account values of fixed annuities, fixed insurance, and the fixed portion of variable annuities and variable insurance contracts by range of guaranteed minimum crediting rates and the range of the difference between rates credited to contractholders as of September 30, 2013 and the respective guaranteed minimums: Account Values with Crediting Rates At Guaranteed Minimum 1-49 bps above Guaranteed Minimum 50-99 bps above Guaranteed Minimum 100-150 bps above Guaranteed Minimum Greater Than 150 bps above Guaranteed MinimumTotalRange of Guaranteed Minimum Crediting Rates(in billions)           1% - 1.99%$0.4 $0.4 $0.4 $0.4 $3.0 $4.62% - 2.99%0.5 0.1 — — — 0.63% - 3.99%9.1 0.1 — 0.1 0.6 9.94% - 5.00%5.8 — — — — 5.8Total$15.8 $0.6 $0.4 $0.5 $3.6 $20.9Percentage of total76% 3% 2% 2% 17% 100%In addition to the fixed rate exposures noted above, RiverSource Life also has the following variable annuity guarantee benefits: guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits (“GMWB”), guaranteed minimum accumulation benefits (“GMAB”), guaranteed minimum death benefits (“GMDB”) and guaranteed minimum income benefits (“GMIB”). Each of these guaranteed benefits guarantees payouts to the annuity holder under certain specific conditions regardless of the performance of the underlying investment assets. The variable annuity guarantees continue to be managed by utilizing a hedging program which attempts to match the sensitivity of the assets with the sensitivity of the liabilities. This approach works with the premise that matched sensitivities will produce a highly effective hedging result. Our comprehensive hedging program focuses mainly on first order sensitivities of assets and liabilities: Equity Market Level (Delta), Interest Rate Level (Rho) and Volatility (Vega). Additionally, various second order sensitivities are managed. We use various index options across the term structure, interest rate swaps and swaptions, total return swaps and futures to manage the risk exposures. The exposures are measured and monitored daily, and adjustments to the hedge portfolio are made as necessary. To evaluate interest rate and equity price risk we perform sensitivity testing which measures the impact on pretax income from the sources listed below for a 12-month period following a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates or a hypothetical 10% decline in equity prices. The interest rate risk test assumes a sudden 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve, with rates then staying at those levels for the next 12 months. The equity price risk test assumes a sudden 10% drop in equity prices, with equity prices then staying at those levels for the next 12 months. In estimating the values of variable annuity riders, equity indexed annuities, stock market certificates, indexed universal life insurance and the associated hedge assets, we assume no change in implied market volatility despite the 10% drop in equity prices. 96Table of ContentsThe following tables present our estimate of the impact on pretax income from the above defined hypothetical market movements as of September 30, 2013:  Equity Price Exposure to Pretax IncomeEquity Price Decline 10% Before Hedge Impact Hedge Impact Net Impact  (in millions)Asset-based management and distribution fees (1) $(223) $7 $(216)DAC and DSIC amortization (2) (3) (96) — (96)Variable annuity riders:      GMDB and GMIB (3) (79) — (79)GMWB (161) 163 2GMAB (40) 39 (1)DAC and DSIC amortization (4) N/A N/A 1Total variable annuity riders (280) 202 (77)Equity indexed annuities 1 (1) —Certificates 3 (3) —Indexed universal life insurance 5 (7) (2)Total $(590) $198 $(391)  Interest Rate Exposure to Pretax IncomeInterest Rate Increase 100 Basis Points Before Hedge Impact Hedge Impact Net Impact  (in millions)Asset-based management and distribution fees (1) $(43) $— $(43)Variable annuity riders:      GMDB and GMIB — — —GMWB 470 (548) (78)GMAB 27 (30) (3)DAC and DSIC amortization (4) N/A N/A 15Total variable annuity riders 497 (578) (66)Fixed annuities, fixed insurance and fixed portion of variable annuities and variable insurance products 57 — 57Brokerage client cash balances 129 — 129Certificates 5 — 5Indexed universal life insurance 5 — 5Total $650 $(578) $87N/A Not Applicable.(1) Excludes incentive income which is impacted by market and fund performance during the period and cannot be readily estimated.(2) Market impact on DAC and DSIC amortization resulting from lower projected profits.(3) In estimating the impact on DAC and DSIC amortization resulting from lower projected profits, we have not changed our assumed equity asset growth rates.

We make this same conservative assumption in estimating the impact from GMDB and GMIB riders.(4) Market impact on DAC and DSIC amortization related to variable annuity riders is modeled net of hedge impact.The above results compare to an estimated negative net impact to pretax income of $318 million related to a 10% equity price decline and an estimated positive net impact to pretax income of $185 million related to a 100 basis point increase in interest rates as of December 31, 2012. The change in the interest rate exposure related to GMWB liabilities is from a refinement in our hedging strategy. 97Table of ContentsNet impacts shown in the above table from GMWB and GMAB riders result largely from differences between the liability valuation basis and the hedging basis. Liabilities are valued using fair value accounting principles, with key policyholder behavior assumptions loaded to provide risk margins and with discount rates increased to reflect a current market estimate of our risk of nonperformance specific to these liabilities. For variable annuity riders introduced prior to mid-2009, management elected to hedge based on best estimate policyholder behavior assumptions. For riders issued since mid-2009, management has been hedging on a basis that includes risk margins related to policyholder behavior. The nonperformance spread risk is not hedged. Actual results could differ materially from those illustrated above as they are based on a number of estimates and assumptions. These include assuming that implied market volatility does not change when equity prices fall by 10%, that management does not increase assumed equity asset growth rates to anticipate recovery of the drop in equity values when valuing DAC, DSIC and GMDB and GMIB liability values and that the 100 basis point increase in interest rates is a parallel shift of the yield curve. Furthermore, we have not tried to anticipate changes in client preferences for different types of assets or other changes in client behavior, nor have we tried to anticipate actions management might take to increase revenues or reduce expenses in these scenarios. The selection of a 100 basis point interest rate increase as well as a 10% equity price decline should not be construed as a prediction of future market events. Impacts of larger or smaller changes in interest rates or equity prices may not be proportional to those shown for a 100 basis point increase in interest rates or a 10% decline in equity prices. Fair Value Measurements We report certain assets and liabilities at fair value; specifically, separate account assets, derivatives, embedded derivatives, properties held by our consolidated property funds, and most investments and cash equivalents. Fair value assumes the exchange of assets or liabilities occurs in orderly transactions and is not the result of a forced liquidation or distressed sale. We include actual market prices, or observable inputs, in our fair value measurements to the extent available. Broker quotes are obtained when quotes from pricing services are not available. We validate prices obtained from third parties through a variety of means such as: price variance analysis, subsequent sales testing, stale price review, price comparison across pricing vendors and due diligence reviews of vendors. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our fair value measurements.Fair Value of Liabilities and Nonperformance Risk Companies are required to measure the fair value of liabilities at the price that would be received to transfer the liability to a market participant (an exit price). Since there is not a market for our obligations of our variable annuity riders and indexed universal life insurance, we consider the assumptions participants in a hypothetical market would make to reflect an exit price. As a result, we adjust the valuation of variable annuity riders and indexed universal life insurance by updating certain contractholder assumptions, adding explicit margins to provide for profit, risk and expenses, and adjusting the rates used to discount expected cash flows to reflect a current market estimate of our nonperformance risk. The nonperformance risk adjustment is based on broker quotes for credit default swaps that are adjusted to estimate the risk of our life insurance company subsidiaries not fulfilling these liabilities. Consistent with general market conditions, this estimate resulted in a spread over the LIBOR swap curve as of September 30, 2013. As our estimate of this spread widens or tightens, the liability will decrease or increase. If this nonperformance credit spread moves to a zero spread over the LIBOR swap curve, the reduction to net income would be approximately $124 million, net of DAC, DSIC and unearned revenue amortization, the reinsurance accrual and income taxes (calculated at the statutory tax rate of 35%), based on September 30, 2013 credit spreads. 98Table of ContentsLiquidity and Capital Resources Overview We maintained substantial liquidity during the nine months ended September 30, 2013. At September 30, 2013, we had $3.1 billion in cash and cash equivalents compared to $2.4 billion at December 31, 2012. We have additional liquidity available through an unsecured revolving credit facility for up to $500 million that expires in September 2018. Under the terms of the underlying credit agreement, we can increase this facility to $750 million upon satisfaction of certain approval requirements. Available borrowings under this facility are reduced by any outstanding letters of credit. At September 30, 2013, we had no outstanding borrowings under this credit facility and had $2 million of outstanding letters of credit. Our junior subordinated notes due 2066 and credit facility contain various administrative, reporting, legal and financial covenants. We were in compliance with all such covenants at September 30, 2013.In September 2013, we issued $600 million of 4.00% senior notes due 2023. In November 2013, we used a portion of the proceeds to redeem $350 million par amount of our 5.65% senior notes due 2015. We expect to record a net pretax loss of approximately $20 million on the redemption of the notes in the fourth quarter of 2013. We expect to use the remainder of the proceeds for general corporate purposes, which may include the additional repayment of our 5.65% senior notes due 2015 and/or our 7.75% senior notes due 2039. For further information on the issuance and redemption of debt, see Note 9 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. We enter into short-term borrowings, which may include repurchase agreements and Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) advances, to reduce reinvestment risk from higher levels of expected annuity net cash flows. Short-term borrowings allow us to receive cash to reinvest in longer-duration assets, while paying back the short-term debt with cash flows generated by the fixed income portfolio. The balance of repurchase agreements at September 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012 was $150 million and $501 million, respectively, which is collateralized with agency residential mortgage backed securities and commercial mortgage backed securities from our investment portfolio. Our subsidiary, RiverSource Life Insurance Company (“RiverSource Life”), is a member of the FHLB of Des Moines, which provides access to collateralized borrowings. As of September 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012, we had $350 million and nil, respectively, of borrowings from the FHLB, which is collateralized with commercial mortgage backed securities. We believe cash flows from operating activities, available cash balances and our availability of revolver borrowings will be sufficient to fund our operating liquidity needs. Dividends from Subsidiaries Ameriprise Financial is primarily a parent holding company for the operations carried out by our wholly owned subsidiaries. Because of our holding company structure, our ability to meet our cash requirements, including the payment of dividends on our common stock, substantially depends upon the receipt of dividends or return of capital from our subsidiaries, particularly our life insurance subsidiary, RiverSource Life, our face-amount certificate subsidiary, Ameriprise Certificate Company (“ACC”), AMPF Holding Corporation, which is the parent company of our retail introducing broker-dealer subsidiary, Ameriprise Financial Services, Inc. (“AFSI”) and our clearing broker-dealer subsidiary, American Enterprise Investment Services, Inc. (“AEIS”), our Auto and Home insurance subsidiary, IDS Property Casualty Insurance Company (“IDS Property Casualty”), doing business as Ameriprise Auto & Home Insurance, our transfer agent subsidiary, Columbia Management Investment Services Corp., our investment advisory company, Columbia Management Investment Advisers, LLC, and Threadneedle. The payment of dividends by many of our subsidiaries is restricted and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to regulatory capital requirements.99Table of ContentsActual capital and regulatory capital requirements for our wholly owned subsidiaries subject to regulatory capital requirements were as follows: Actual Capital Regulatory Capital Requirements September 30, 2013 December 31, 2012 September 30, 2013 December 31, 2012 (in millions)RiverSource Life(1)(2)$2,872 $3,257 N/A $620RiverSource Life of NY(1)(2)249 256 N/A 44IDS Property Casualty(1)(3)482 462 $173 160Ameriprise Insurance Company(1)(3)43 43 2 2ACC(4)(5)228 204 209 187Threadneedle(6)244 183 153 156Ameriprise National Trust Bank(7)16 142 10 14AFSI(3)(4)95 88 2 2Ameriprise Captive Insurance Company(3)60 59 12 12Ameriprise Trust Company(3)55 48 53 47AEIS(3)(4)109 114 42 39RiverSource Distributors, Inc.(3)(4)25 25 # #Columbia Management Investment Distributors, Inc.(3)(4)33 29 # #N/A Not applicable.# Amounts are less than $1 million.(1) Actual capital is determined on a statutory basis.(2) Regulatory capital requirement is based on the statutory risk-based capital filing.(3) Regulatory capital requirement is based on the applicable regulatory requirement, calculated as of September 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012.(4) Actual capital is determined on an adjusted GAAP basis.(5) ACC is required to hold capital in compliance with the Minnesota Department of Commerce and SEC capital requirements.(6) Actual capital and regulatory capital requirements are determined in accordance with U.K. regulatory legislation. The regulatory capital requirements at September 30, 2013 represent management's assessment at June 30, 2013 of the risk based requirements, as specified by FCA regulations.(7) In January 2013, we completed the conversion of our federal savings bank subsidiary, Ameriprise Bank, FSB, to a limited powers national trust bank, which conversion included changing the name of this subsidiary to Ameriprise National Trust Bank. As of September 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012, this subsidiary was required to maintain capital in compliance with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”) regulations and policies.In addition to the particular regulations restricting dividend payments and establishing subsidiary capitalization requirements, we take into account the overall health of the business, capital levels and risk management considerations in determining a dividend strategy for payments to our company from our subsidiaries, and in deciding to use cash to make capital contributions to our subsidiaries. During the nine months ended September 30, 2013, the parent holding company received cash dividends or a return of capital from its subsidiaries of $1.3 billion (including $675 million from RiverSource Life and $130 million from Ameriprise Bank) and contributed cash to its subsidiaries of $44 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2012, the parent holding company received cash dividends or a return of capital from its subsidiaries of $1.2 billion (including $740 million from RiverSource Life) and contributed cash to its subsidiaries of $98 million. Dividends Paid to Shareholders and Share Repurchases We paid regular quarterly dividends to our shareholders totaling $307 million and $218 million for the nine months ended9/30/2013 and 2012, respectively. On October 29, 2013, we announced a quarterly dividend of $0.52 per common share. The dividend will be paid on November 22, 2013 to our shareholders of record at the close of business on November 12, 2013. On October 24, 2012, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized an expenditure of up to an additional $2.0 billion for the repurchase of shares of our common stock through 2014. As of September 30, 2013, we had $1.0 billion remaining under this 100Table of Contentsshare repurchase authorization. We intend to fund share repurchases through existing working capital, capital released from the transition of Ameriprise Bank from a federal savings bank to a limited powers national trust bank, future earnings and other customary financing methods. The share repurchase program does not require the purchase of any minimum number of shares, and depending on market conditions and other factors, these purchases may be commenced or suspended at any time without prior notice. Acquisitions under the share repurchase program may be made in the open market, through privately negotiated transactions or block trades or other means. During the nine months ended9/30/2013, we repurchased a total of 14.3 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $77.81 per share. Cash Flows Cash flows of CIEs are reflected in our cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities, investing activities and financing activities. Cash held by CIEs is not available for general use by Ameriprise Financial, nor is Ameriprise Financial cash available for general use by its CIEs. As such, the operating, investing and financing cash flows of the CIEs have no impact to the change in cash and cash equivalents. Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.1 billion for the nine months ended9/30/2013 compared to $883 million for the prior year period primarily reflecting higher earnings. Investing Activities Our investing activities primarily relate to our Available-for-Sale investment portfolio. Further, this activity is significantly affected by the net flows of our investment certificate, fixed annuity and universal life products reflected in financing activities. Net cash used in investing activities was $143 million for the nine months ended9/30/2013 compared to net cash provided by investing activities of $1.1 billion for the prior year period. The decrease in cash of $1.3 billion compared to the prior year period was primarily due to a $749 million increase in purchases of Available-for-Sale securities, a $115 million decrease in proceeds from sales and maturities, sinking fund payments and calls of Available-for-Sale securities and a $1.2 billion increase in purchases of investments by consolidated investment entities, partially offset by a $596 million increase in proceeds from sales, maturities and repayments of investments by consolidated investment entities.  Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities decreased $1.3 billion to $207 million for the nine months ended9/30/2013 compared to $1.5 billion for the prior year period. Net cash inflows related to investment certificates and banking time deposits increased $133 million compared to the prior year period driven by higher net proceeds from investment certificates. Cash flows for the prior year period included a $246 million decrease from the net change in banking deposits. Cash proceeds from issuance of debt, net of issuance costs, was $593 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 compared to nil for the prior year period. Cash outflows for dividends paid to shareholders increased $88 million compared to the prior year period. Cash used for the repurchase of common stock, which includes stock repurchases and shares surrendered to cover income tax obligations of holders of share-based compensation awards, increased $197 million compared to the prior year period. Cash flows related to CIEs increased $600 million compared to the prior year period primarily due to changes in CIE debt.Contractual Commitments There have been no material changes to our contractual obligations disclosed in our 2012 10-K. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We provide asset management services to various collateralized debt obligations and other investment products, which are sponsored by us for the investment of client assets in the normal course of business. Certain of these investment entities are considered to be variable interest entities while others are considered to be voting rights entities. We consolidate certain of these investment entities. For entities that we do not consolidate, our maximum exposure to loss is our investment in the entity, which was not material as of September 30, 2013. We have no obligation to provide further financial or other support to these structured investments nor have we provided any support to these structured investments. See Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our arrangements with structured investments.101Table of ContentsForward-Looking Statements This report contains forward-looking statements that reflect management’s plans, estimates and beliefs.
