Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2014 10-K, “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in this Form 10-Q and other factors as discussed herein.Equity price, credit market and interest rate fluctuations can have a significant impact on our results of operations, primarily due to the effects they have on the asset management and other asset-based fees we earn, the “spread” income generated on our fixed annuities, fixed insurance, deposit products and the fixed portion of variable annuities and variable insurance contracts, the value of deferred acquisition costs (“DAC”) and deferred sales inducement costs (“DSIC”) assets, the values of liabilities for guaranteed benefits associated with our variable annuities and the values of derivatives held to hedge these benefits.Earnings, as well as operating earnings, will continue to be negatively impacted by the ongoing low interest rate environment. In addition to continuing spread compression in our interest sensitive product lines, a sustained low interest rate environment may result in increases to our reserves and changes in various rate assumptions we use to amortize DAC and DSIC, which may negatively impact our operating earnings. For additional discussion on our interest rate risk, see Item 3. “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.”We consolidate certain collateralized loan obligations (“CLOs”) and property funds (pooled investment vehicles) for which we provide asset management services. These entities are defined as consolidated investment entities (“CIEs”). While the consolidation of the CIEs impacts our balance sheet and income statement, our exposure to these entities is unchanged and there is no impact to the underlying business results. For further information on CIEs, see Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Changes in the valuation of the CIE assets and liabilities impact pretax income. The net income (loss) of the CIEs is reflected in net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests. The results of operations of the CIEs are reflected in the Corporate & Other segment. On a consolidated basis, the management fees we earn for the services we provide to the CIEs and the related general and administrative expenses are eliminated and the changes in the assets and liabilities related to the CIEs, primarily syndicated loans and debt, are reflected in net investment income. We continue to include the fees from these entities in the management and financial advice fees line within our Asset Management segment.While our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), management believes that operating measures, which exclude net realized gains or losses; the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits, net of hedges and the related DSIC and DAC amortization; the market impact on indexed universal life benefits, net of hedges and the related DAC amortization, unearned revenue amortization and the reinsurance accrual; integration and restructuring charges; income (loss) from discontinued operations; and the impact of consolidating CIEs, best reflect the underlying performance of our core operations and facilitate a more meaningful trend analysis. Management uses certain of these non-GAAP measures to evaluate our financial performance on a basis comparable to that used by some securities analysts and investors. Also, certain of these non-GAAP measures are taken into consideration, to varying degrees, for purposes of business planning and analysis 50AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. and for certain compensation-related matters. Throughout our Management’s Discussion and Analysis, these non-GAAP measures are referred to as operating measures.It is management’s priority to increase shareholder value over a multi-year horizon by achieving our on-average, over-time financial targets.Our financial targets are:•Operating total net revenue growth of 6% to 8%,•Operating earnings per diluted share growth of 12% to 15%, and•Operating return on equity excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) of 19% to 23%.The following tables reconcile our GAAP measures to operating measures: Three Months Ended March 31, 2015 2014 (in millions)Total net revenues$3,053 $2,996Less: Revenue attributable to CIEs149 177Less: Net realized gains10 5Less: Market impact on indexed universal life benefits(4) 2Operating total net revenues$2,898 $2,812     Per Diluted Share Three Months Ended March 31, Three Months Ended March 31, 2015 2014 2015 2014 (in millions, except per share amounts)Net income$479 $515    Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests86 115    Net income attributable to Ameriprise Financial393 400 $2.08 $2.01Less: Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax— (1) — —Net income from continuing operations attributable to Ameriprise Financial393 401 2.08 2.01Add: Market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits, net of tax (1)22 10 0.12 0.05Add: Market impact on indexed universal life benefits, net of tax (1)4 (1) 0.02 —Less: Net realized gains, net of tax (1)7 3 0.04 0.02Operating earnings$412 $407 $2.18 $2.04        Weighted average common shares outstanding:       Basic186.3 195.5    Diluted189.1 199.1    (1) Calculated using the statutory tax rate of 35%.51AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC.

After-tax is calculated using the statutory rate of 35%.Critical Accounting PoliciesThe accounting and reporting policies that we use affect our Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of our accounting and reporting policies are critical to an understanding of our consolidated results of operations and financial condition. In some cases, the application of these policies can be significantly affected by the estimates, judgments and assumptions made by management during the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements. These accounting policies are discussed in detail in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis — Critical Accounting Policies” in our 2014 10-K.Recent Accounting PronouncementsFor information regarding recent accounting pronouncements and their expected impact on our future consolidated results of operations and financial condition, see Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. 52AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. Assets Under Management and AdministrationAssets under management (“AUM”) include external client assets for which we provide investment management services, such as the assets of the Columbia funds and Threadneedle funds, assets of institutional clients and assets of clients in our advisor platform held in wrap accounts as well as assets managed by sub-advisers selected by us. AUM also includes certain assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets for which we provide investment management services and recognize management fees in our Asset Management segment, such as the assets of the general account and the variable product funds held in the separate accounts of our life insurance subsidiaries and CIEs. These assets do not include assets under advisement, for which we provide model portfolios but do not have full discretionary investment authority. Corporate & Other AUM primarily includes former bank assets that are managed within our Corporate & Other segment.Assets under administration (“AUA”) include assets for which we provide administrative services such as client assets invested in other companies’ products that we offer outside of our wrap accounts. These assets include those held in clients’ brokerage accounts. We generally record revenues received from administered assets as distribution fees. We do not exercise management discretion over these assets and do not earn a management fee. These assets are not reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. AUA also includes certain assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets for which we do not provide investment management services and do not recognize management fees, such as investments in non-affiliated funds held in the separate accounts of our life insurance subsidiaries. These assets do not include assets under advisement, for which we provide model portfolios but do not have full discretionary investment authority.The following table presents detail regarding our AUM and AUA: March 31,   2015 2014 Change (in billions)  Assets Under Management and Administration       Advice & Wealth Management AUM$179.4 $158.8 $20.6 13 %Asset Management AUM506.3 503.9 2.4 —Corporate & Other AUM0.7 0.9 (0.2) (22)Eliminations(22.5) (20.5) (2.0) (10)Total Assets Under Management663.9 643.1 20.8 3Total Assets Under Administration150.9 139.7 11.2 8Total AUM and AUA$814.8 $782.8 $32.0 4 %Total AUM increased $20.8 billion, or 3%, to $663.9 billion as of March 31, 2015 compared to $643.1 billion as of March 31, 2014 primarily due to a $20.6 billion increase in Advice & Wealth Management AUM driven by wrap account net inflows and market appreciation. See our segment results of operations discussion below for additional information on changes in our AUM.53AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. Consolidated Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended March 31, 2015 and 2014 The following table presents our consolidated results of operations: Three Months Ended March 31,   2015 2014 Change (in millions)  Revenues       Management and financial advice fees$1,468 $1,386 $82 6 %Distribution fees466 476 (10) (2)Net investment income484 471 13 3Premiums353 330 23 7Other revenues289 340 (51) (15)Total revenues3,060 3,003 57 2Banking and deposit interest expense7 7 — —Total net revenues3,053 2,996 57 2Expenses       Distribution expenses819 786 33 4Interest credited to fixed accounts172 186 (14) (8)Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses533 450 83 18Amortization of deferred acquisition costs75 87 (12) (14)Interest and debt expense84 79 5 6General and administrative expense752 758 (6) (1)Total expenses2,435 2,346 89 4Income from continuing operations before income tax provision618 650 (32) (5)Income tax provision139 134 5 4Income from continuing operations479 516 (37) (7)Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax— (1) 1 NMNet income479 515 (36) (7)Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests86 115 (29) (25)Net income attributable to Ameriprise Financial$393 $400 $(7) (2)%NM Not Meaningful.OverallIncome from continuing operations before income tax provision decreased $32 million, or 5%, to $618 million for the three months ended March 31, 2015 compared to $650 million for the prior year period primarily reflecting a $32 million long term care (“LTC”) reserve increase, the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits (net of hedges and the related DSIC and DAC amortization), a $27 million benefit in the prior year period from policyholder movement of investments in Portfolio Navigator (traditional asset allocation) funds under certain in force variable annuities with living benefit guarantees to the Portfolio Stabilizer (managed volatility) funds compared to a $2 million benefit in the current period, asset management net outflows and a decrease in net income from CIEs, partially offset by the impact of market appreciation, wrap account net inflows, and lower auto and home losses. The market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits (net of hedges and the related DSIC and DAC amortization) was an expense of $34 million for the three months ended March 31, 2015 compared to an expense of $15 million for the prior year period. 54AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. Net RevenuesNet revenues increased $57 million, or 2%, to $3.1 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2015 compared to $3.0 billion for the prior year period primarily due to higher management and financial advice fees and premiums, partially offset by a decrease in other revenues.Management and financial advice fees increased $82 million, or 6%, to $1.5 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2015 compared to $1.4 billion for the prior year period primarily due to higher asset-based fees driven by an increase in average AUM. Average AUM increased $25.6 billion, or 4%, compared to the prior year period primarily due to market appreciation and wrap account net inflows, partially offset by asset management net outflows and the negative impact of foreign currency translation. See our discussion on the changes in AUM in our segment results of operations section below.Distribution fees decreased $10 million, or 2%, to $466 million for the three months ended March 31, 2015 compared to $476 million for the prior year period due to lower client activity reflecting increased market volatility and slower sales in certain products, partially offset by higher client assets.Net investment income increased $13 million, or 3%, to $484 million for the three months ended March 31, 2015 compared to $471 million for the prior year period primarily due to a $31 million increase in net investment income of CIEs, partially offset by a $20 million decrease in investment income on fixed maturities driven by low interest rates.Premiums increased $23 million, or 7%, to $353 million for the three months ended March 31, 2015 compared to $330 million for the prior year period due to growth in auto and home premiums driven by higher policies in force. Auto and home policies in force increased 10% compared to the prior year period.Other revenues decreased $51 million, or 15%, to $289 million for the three months ended March 31, 2015 compared to $340 million for the prior year period due to a $59 million decrease in other revenues of CIEs, partially offset by higher fees from variable annuity guarantee sales in the prior year where the fees start on the first anniversary date and higher average fee rates. ExpensesTotal expenses increased $89 million, or 4%, to $2.4 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2015 compared to $2.3 billion for the prior year period primarily due to increases in distribution expenses and benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses, partially offset by decreases in interest credited to fixed accounts and amortization of DAC.Distribution expenses increased $33 million, or 4%, to $819 million for the three months ended March 31, 2015 compared to $786 million for the prior year period driven by higher advisor compensation due to growth in assets under management. See our discussion on the changes in AUM in our segment results of operations section below.Interest credited to fixed accounts decreased $14 million, or 8%, to $172 million for the three months ended March 31, 2015 compared to $186 million for the prior year period primarily due to lower average fixed annuity account balances and a lower average crediting rate on interest sensitive fixed annuities. Average fixed annuity account balances decreased $1.2 billion, or 9%, to $11.9 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2015 compared to the prior year period due to net outflows reflecting limited new sales from low rates and higher lapse rates. The average fixed annuity crediting rate excluding capitalized interest decreased to 3.0% for the three months ended March 31, 2015 compared to 3.3% for the prior year period reflecting the re-pricing of the five-year guarantee block. See additional discussion on the re-pricing in the Annuities segment.Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses increased $83 million, or 18%, to $533 million for the three months ended March 31, 2015 compared to $450 million for the prior year period primarily reflecting the following items:•A $3 million increase in benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses related to our auto and home business due to an increase in the provision for estimated losses reflecting the impact of growth in exposures from a 10% increase in policies in force and higher 2015 accident year loss ratio assumptions consistent with the fourth quarter 2014 accident year level, partially offset by a decrease in weather-related losses and a $30 million expense in the prior year period related to an increase to prior accident year loss reserves reflecting adverse development in the 2013 and prior accident years auto liability coverage. Weather-related losses were $12 million for the three months ended March 31, 2015 compared to $20 million for the prior year period. •A $5 million increase in expense related to higher reserve funding driven by the impact of higher fees from variable annuity guarantee sales in the prior year where the fees start on the first anniversary date.•An increase in expenses compared to the prior year period due to a $32 million benefit in the first quarter of 2014 from policyholder movement of investments in Portfolio Navigator funds under certain in force variable annuities with living benefit guarantees to the Portfolio Stabilizer funds compared to $3 million in the first quarter of 2015. See additional discussion in the Annuities segment.55AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. •A $32 million increase in LTC reserves in the first quarter of 2015. See additional discussion in the Protection segment.•A $7 million favorable impact from a change in the discount rate for disability income (“DI”) products in the first quarter of 2015.•A $29 million decrease in expense compared to the prior year period from the unhedged nonperformance credit spread risk adjustment on variable annuity guaranteed benefits. As the embedded derivative liability on which the nonperformance credit spread is applied increases (decreases), the impact of the nonperformance credit spread is favorable (unfavorable) to expense. The favorable impact of the nonperformance credit spread was $44 million for the first quarter of 2015 compared to $15 million for the prior year period.•A $52 million increase in expense from other market impacts on variable annuity guaranteed benefits, net of hedges in place to offset those risks and the related DSIC amortization. This increase was the result of an unfavorable $238 million change in the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits reserves, a favorable $186 million change in the market impact on derivatives hedging the variable annuity guaranteed benefits and no DSIC offset. The main market drivers contributing to these changes are summarized below:•Interest rates were down in the first quarter of 2015 and 2014, but decreased more in the first quarter of 2015 resulting in a larger unfavorable change in the variable annuity guaranteed living benefits liability compared to the prior year period, partially offset by a larger favorable change in the related hedge assets compared to the prior year period. •Equity market volatility impacts on the variable annuity guaranteed living benefits liability resulted in an increase in expense in the first quarter of 2015 compared to a decrease in expense in the prior year period. This unfavorable change was partially offset by a decrease in expense in the first quarter of 2015 compared to an increase in expense in the prior year period from equity market volatility impacts on the related hedge assets.•Other unhedged items, including the difference between the assumed and actual underlying separate account investment performance, fixed income credit exposures, transaction costs and various behavioral items, were a net unfavorable impact compared to the prior year period.Amortization of DAC decreased $12 million, or 14%, to $75 million for the three months ended March 31, 2015 compared to $87 million for the prior year period primarily reflecting the following items: •The DAC offset to the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits (net of hedges and the related DSIC amortization) was a benefit of $4 million for the first quarter of 2015 compared to nil for the prior year period.•The impact on DAC from actual versus expected market performance based on our view of bond and equity performance was a benefit of $9 million for the first quarter of 2015 compared to a benefit of $6 million for the prior year period. •A $4 million decrease in expenses compared to the prior year period from the DAC offset related to policyholder movement of investments in Portfolio Navigator funds under certain in force variable annuities with living benefit guarantees to the Portfolio Stabilizer funds.Income TaxesOur effective tax rate on income from continuing operations including income attributable to noncontrolling interests was 22.5% for the three months ended March 31, 2015 compared to 20.7% for the prior year period. Our effective tax rate on income from continuing operations excluding income attributable to noncontrolling interests was 26.1% for the three months ended March 31, 2015 compared to 25.1% for the prior year period. The effective tax rates for the three months ended March 31, 2015 and 2014 were lower than the statutory rate as a result of tax preferred items including the dividends received deduction and low income housing tax credits. 56AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. Results of Operations by Segment for the Three Months Ended March 31, 2015 and 2014 Operating earnings is the measure of segment profit or loss management uses to evaluate segment performance. Operating earnings should not be viewed as a substitute for GAAP income from continuing operations before income tax provision. We believe the presentation of segment operating earnings as we measure it for management purposes enhances the understanding of our business by reflecting the underlying performance of our core operations and facilitating a more meaningful trend analysis. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the presentation of segment results and our definition of operating earnings.The following table presents summary financial information by segment: Three Months Ended March 31, 2015 2014 (in millions)Advice & Wealth Management   Net revenues$1,228 $1,149Expenses1,018 968Operating earnings$210 $181Asset Management   Net revenues$807 $807Expenses616 624Operating earnings$191 $183Annuities   Net revenues$631 $636Expenses459 460Operating earnings$172 $176Protection   Net revenues$590 $555Expenses539 496Operating earnings$51 $59Corporate & Other   Net revenues$(6) $6Expenses56 61Operating loss$(62) $(55) Advice & Wealth ManagementOur Advice & Wealth Management segment provides financial planning and advice, as well as full-service brokerage services, primarily to retail clients through our advisors. These services are centered on long-term, personal relationships between our advisors and our clients and focus on helping clients confidently achieve their financial goals. Our advisors provide a distinctive approach to financial planning and have access to a broad selection of both affiliated and non-affiliated products to help clients meet their financial needs. A significant portion of revenues in this segment is fee-based, driven by the level of client assets, which is impacted by both market movements and net asset flows. We also earn net investment income on invested assets primarily from certificate products. This segment earns revenues (distribution fees) for distributing non-affiliated products and intersegment revenues (distribution fees) for distributing our affiliated products and services to our retail clients. Intersegment expenses for this segment include expenses for investment management services provided by the Asset Management segment.In addition to purchases of affiliated and non-affiliated mutual funds and other securities on a stand-alone basis, clients may purchase mutual funds, among other securities, in connection with investment advisory fee-based “wrap account” programs or services, and pay fees based on a percentage of their assets.57AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC.

Nets flows for the SPS program are now reported on a consistent basis with our other wrap account programs.(2) Advisory wrap account assets represent those assets for which clients receive advisory services and are the primary driver of revenue earned on wrap accounts. Clients may hold non-advisory investments in their wrap accounts that do not incur an advisory fee.(3) Average ending balances are calculated using an average of the prior period’s ending balance and all months in the current period.Wrap account assets increased $5.3 billion, or 3%, during the three months ended March 31, 2015 due to net inflows of $2.8 billion and market appreciation and other of $2.5 billion. Average advisory wrap account assets increased $21.3 billion, or 14%, compared to the prior year period due to net inflows and market appreciation.The following table presents the changes in wrap account assets for the twelve months ended March 31: 2015 2014 (in billions)Beginning balance$159.4 $133.8Net flows (1)12.8 13.2Market appreciation and other (1)7.8 12.4Ending balance$180.0 $159.4(1) See Note 1 in the table above.Wrap account assets increased $20.6 billion, or 13%, from the prior year period reflecting net inflows and market appreciation.The following table presents the results of operations of our Advice & Wealth Management segment on an operating basis: Three Months Ended March 31,     2015 2014 Change (in millions)  Revenues   Management and financial advice fees$637 $555 $82 15 %Distribution fees543 547 (4) (1)Net investment income35 34 1 3Other revenues20 20 — —Total revenues1,235 1,156 79 7Banking and deposit interest expense7 7 — —Total net revenues1,228 1,149 79 7 Expenses    Distribution expenses757 707 50 7Interest and debt expense2 2 — —General and administrative expense259 259 — —Total expenses1,018 968 50 5Operating earnings$210 $181 $29 16 %58AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. Our Advice & Wealth Management segment pretax operating earnings, which exclude net realized gains or losses, increased $29 million, or 16%, to $210 million for the three months ended March 31, 2015 compared to $181 million for the prior year period primarily due to growth in wrap account assets and continued expense management, partially offset by the impact of lower client activity reflecting increased market volatility and slower sales in certain products. Pretax operating margin was 17.1% for the three months ended March 31, 2015 compared to 15.8% for the prior year period.Net RevenuesNet revenues exclude net realized gains or losses. Net revenues increased $79 million, or 7%, to $1.2 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2015 compared to $1.1 billion for the prior year period primarily reflecting wrap account net inflows and market appreciation, partially offset by lower client activity. Operating net revenue per branded advisor increased to $127,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2015, up 8%, from $118,000 the prior year period driven by asset growth. Total branded advisors were 9,691 at March 31, 2015 compared to 9,704 at March 31, 2014.Management and financial advice fees increased $82 million, or 15%, to $637 million for the three months ended March 31, 2015 compared to $555 million for the prior year period driven by growth in wrap account assets. Average advisory wrap account assets increased $21.3 billion, or 14%, compared to the prior year period due to net inflows and market appreciation. See our discussion of the changes in wrap account assets above.ExpensesTotal expenses increased $50 million, or 5%, to $1.0 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2015 compared to $1.0 billion for the prior year period due to a $50 million increase in distribution expenses driven by higher advisor compensation due to growth in wrap account assets.Asset ManagementOur Asset Management segment provides investment advice and investment products to retail, high net worth and institutional clients on a global scale through Columbia Threadneedle Investments. We provide clients with U.S. domestic individual products through unaffiliated third party financial institutions and through our Advice & Wealth Management segment, and we provide institutional products and services through our institutional sales force. International retail products are primarily distributed through third-party financial institutions and unaffiliated financial advisors. Individual products include U.S. mutual funds and non-U.S. equivalents, exchange-traded funds and variable product funds underlying insurance and annuity separate accounts. Institutional asset management services are designed to meet specific client objectives and may involve a range of products, including those that focus on traditional asset classes, separately managed accounts, individually managed accounts, collateralized loan obligations, hedge funds, collective funds and property funds. Collateralized loan obligations, hedge funds and certain private funds are often classified as alternative assets. Revenues in this segment are primarily earned as fees based on managed asset balances, which are impacted by market movements, net asset flows, asset allocation and product mix. We may also earn performance fees from certain accounts where investment performance meets or exceeds certain pre-identified targets. Our Asset Management segment also provides intercompany asset management services for Ameriprise Financial subsidiaries. The fees for such services are reflected within the Asset Management segment results through intersegment transfer pricing. Intersegment expenses for this segment include distribution expenses for services provided by our Advice & Wealth Management, Annuities and Protection segments.From time to time, fee waivers have been provided to the Columbia Money Market Funds (the “Funds”) by Columbia Management and certain other subsidiaries performing services for the Funds for the purpose of reducing the expenses charged to a Fund in a given period to maintain or improve a Fund’s net yield in that period. Our subsidiaries may enter into contractual arrangements with the Funds identifying the specific fees to be waived and/or expenses to be reimbursed, as well as the time period for which such waivers will apply. In aggregate, we voluntarily waived fees of $2 million and $3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.59AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC.

Mutual fund performance rankings are based on the performance of Class Z fund shares for Columbia branded mutual funds. Only funds with Class Z shares are included. In instances where a fund’s Class Z shares do not have a full five year track record, performance for an older share class of the same fund, typically Class A shares, is utilized for the period before Class Z shares were launched. No adjustments to the historical track records are made to account for differences in fund expenses between share classes of a fund.Equal Weighted Rankings in Top 2 Quartiles: Counts the number of funds with above median ranking divided by the total number of funds. Asset size is not a factor.Asset Weighted Rankings in Top 2 Quartiles: Sums the total assets of the funds with above median ranking (using Class Z and appended Class Z) divided by total assets of all funds.

Total segment AUM net outflows were $5.8 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2015. Management expects, consistent with prior patterns of outflows, that outflows of primarily low margin assets directly or indirectly affiliated with Threadneedle and Columbia former parent companies will continue for the foreseeable future. The overall impact to segment results is difficult to quantify due to uncertain timing, volume and mix of the outflows. Columbia managed assets increased $3.0 billion, or 1%, during the three months ended March 31, 2015 primarily due to market appreciation, partially offset by net outflows. Columbia retail funds increased $1.8 billion, or 1%, during the three months ended March 31, 2015 due to market appreciation, partially offset by net outflows. Columbia retail net outflows of $2.9 billion during the first quarter of 2015 included $2.3 billion of outflows in the Columbia Acorn Fund reflecting elevated outflows related to underperformance and $0.5 billion of outflows from a former parent affiliated distribution relationship. Columbia institutional AUM increased $1.1 billion, or 1%, during the three months ended March 31, 2015 due to market appreciation, partially offset by net outflows of $0.4 billion. 64AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. Threadneedle managed assets decreased $0.7 billion during the three months ended March 31, 2015 due to a $7.3 billion negative impact of foreign currency translation and net outflows of $1.1 billion, partially offset by market appreciation. Threadneedle retail funds increased $0.6 billion, or 1%, during the three months ended March 31, 2015 due to market appreciation and net inflows of $0.5 billion which included increased flows into Asian equity products, partially offset by a $2.3 billion negative impact of foreign currency translation. Threadneedle institutional AUM decreased $1.3 billion, or 1%, during the three months ended March 31, 2015 primarily due to net outflows and a $5.0 billion negative impact of foreign currency translation, partially offset by market appreciation. Threadneedle institutional net outflows of $1.6 billion during the first quarter of 2015 included outflows of $0.8 billion from legacy insurance assets and $0.9 billion from an institutional insurance client associated with asset reallocation to funds we do not offer.

Net RevenuesNet revenues, which exclude net realized gains or losses, were flat at $807 million for the three months ended March 31, 2015 compared to the prior year period as market appreciation was offset by net outflows, as well as a $15 million negative impact of foreign exchange.ExpensesTotal expenses decreased $8 million, or 1%, to $616 million for the three months ended March 31, 2015 compared to $624 million for the prior year period primarily due to a $6 million decrease in distribution expenses and a $1 million decrease in general and administrative expenses reflecting a positive impact of foreign exchange, partially offset by costs associated with the move to a new London office. 65AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. AnnuitiesOur Annuities segment provides variable and fixed annuity products of RiverSource Life companies to individual clients. We provide our variable annuity products through our advisors, and our fixed annuity products are distributed through both affiliated and unaffiliated advisors and financial institutions. Revenues from our variable annuity products are primarily earned as fees based on underlying account balances, which are impacted by both market movements and net asset flows. Revenues from our fixed annuity products are primarily earned as net investment income on assets supporting fixed account balances, with profitability significantly impacted by the spread between net investment income earned and interest credited on the fixed account balances. We also earn net investment income on owned assets supporting reserves for immediate annuities and for certain guaranteed benefits offered with variable annuities and on capital supporting the business. Intersegment revenues for this segment reflect fees paid by our Asset Management segment for marketing support and other services provided in connection with the availability of variable insurance trust funds (“VIT Funds”) under the variable annuity contracts. Intersegment expenses for this segment include distribution expenses for services provided by our Advice & Wealth Management segment, as well as expenses for investment management services provided by our Asset Management segment.The following table presents the results of operations of our Annuities segment on an operating basis: Three Months Ended March 31,     2015 2014 Change (in millions)  Revenues       Management and financial advice fees$190 $183 $7 4 %Distribution fees89 88 1 1Net investment income221 242 (21) (9)Premiums22 26 (4) (15)Other revenues109 97 12 12Total revenues631 636 (5) (1)Banking and deposit interest expense— — — —Total net revenues631 636 (5) (1)Expenses       Distribution expenses108 107 1 1Interest credited to fixed accounts127 148 (21) (14)Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses115 86 29 34Amortization of deferred acquisition costs43 54 (11) (20)Interest and debt expense10 10 — —General and administrative expense56 55 1 2Total expenses459 460 (1) —Operating earnings$172 $176 $(4) (2)%Our Annuities segment pretax operating income, which excludes net realized gains or losses and the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits (net of hedges and the related DSIC and DAC amortization), decreased $4 million, or 2%, to $172 million for the three months ended March 31, 2015 compared to $176 million for the prior year period primarily due to a lower benefit from policyholder movement of investments in Portfolio Navigator funds under certain in-force variable annuities with living benefit guarantees to the Portfolio Stabilizer funds, partially offset by market appreciation. During the fourth quarter of 2013, we added Portfolio Stabilizer fund options for our in force variable annuities with living benefit guarantees. During the first quarter of 2014, approximately $1.8 billion of account value was moved into these funds, exceeding expectations. The resulting earnings benefit for the first quarter of 2014 was $29 million. This compares to a benefit of $2 million for the first quarter of 2015. We anticipate a very minimal benefit to earnings going forward.RiverSource variable annuity account balances increased 3% to $77.9 billion at March 31, 2015 compared to the prior year period due to market appreciation, partially offset by net outflows of $1.7 billion. 66AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. RiverSource fixed annuity account balances declined 10% to $11.7 billion at March 31, 2015 compared to the prior year period reflecting limited sales from low rates and higher lapse rates related to the re-pricing of the five-year guarantee block during 2014, a portion of which came out of its surrender charge period during the first quarter of 2015. At March 31, 2014, approximately $3.0 billion of the $4.1 billion five-year guarantee block was re-priced. The change in crediting rates decreased the level of spread compression in both periods. Net RevenuesNet revenues, which exclude net realized gains or losses, decreased $5 million, or 1%, to $631 million for the three months ended March 31, 2015 compared to $636 million for the prior year period primarily due to lower net investment income, partially offset by higher management and financial advice fees and other revenues.Management and financial advice fees increased $7 million, or 4%, to $190 million for the three months ended March 31, 2015 compared to $183 million for the prior year period due to higher fees on variable annuities driven by higher separate account balances. Average variable annuity account balances increased $2.4 billion, or 3%, compared to the prior year period due to market appreciation, partially offset by net outflows.Net investment income, which excludes net realized gains or losses, decreased $21 million, or 9%, to $221 million for the three months ended March 31, 2015 compared to $242 million for the prior year period primarily reflecting a decrease of approximately $17 million from lower invested assets due to fixed annuity net outflows and approximately $4 million from lower interest rates.Other revenues increased $12 million, or 12%, to $109 million for the three months ended March 31, 2015 compared to $97 million for the prior year period due to higher fees from variable annuity guarantee sales in the prior year where the fees start on the first anniversary date, as well as higher average fee rates.ExpensesTotal expenses, which exclude the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits (net of hedges and the related DSIC and DAC amortization), decreased $1 million to $459 million for the three months ended March 31, 2015 compared to $460 million for the prior year period primarily due to lower interest credited to fixed accounts and amortization of DAC, partially offset by higher benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses. Interest credited to fixed accounts decreased $21 million, or 14%, to $127 million for the three months ended March 31, 2015 compared to $148 million for the prior year period driven by lower average fixed annuity account balances and a lower average crediting rate on interest sensitive fixed annuities. Average fixed annuity account balances decreased $1.2 billion, or 9%, to $11.9 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2015 compared to the prior year period due to net outflows reflecting limited new sales from low rates and higher lapse rates. The average fixed annuity crediting rate excluding capitalized interest decreased to 3.0% for the three months ended March 31, 2015 compared to 3.3% for the prior year period reflecting the re-pricing of the five-year guarantee block.Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses, which exclude the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits (net of hedges and the related DSIC amortization), increased $29 million, or 34%, to $115 million for the three months ended March 31, 2015 compared to $86 million for the prior year period primarily due to a $34 million benefit in the first quarter of 2014 from policyholder movement of investments in Portfolio Navigator funds under certain in-force variable annuities with living benefit guarantees to the Portfolio Stabilizer funds compared to a $3 million benefit in the first quarter of 2015. Amortization of DAC, which excludes the DAC offset to the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits, decreased $11 million, or 20%, to $43 million for the three months ended March 31, 2015 compared to $54 million for the prior year period. The DAC offset related to policyholder movement of investments in Portfolio Navigator funds under certain in force variable annuities with living benefit guarantees to the Portfolio Stabilizer funds was $1 million for the first quarter of 2015 compared to $5 million for the prior year period. The impact on DAC from actual versus expected market performance based on our view of bond and equity performance was a benefit of $8 million for the first quarter of 2015 compared to a benefit of $6 million for the prior year period. 67AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. ProtectionOur Protection segment offers a variety of products to address the protection and risk management needs of our retail clients including life, DI and property casualty insurance. Life and DI products are primarily provided through our advisors. Our property casualty products are sold primarily through affinity relationships. We issue insurance policies through our life insurance and property casualty subsidiaries. The primary sources of revenues for this segment are premiums, fees and charges we receive to assume insurance-related risk. We earn net investment income on owned assets supporting insurance reserves and capital supporting the business. We also receive fees based on the level of assets supporting VUL separate account balances. This segment earns intersegment revenues from fees paid by our Asset Management segment for marketing support and other services provided in connection with the availability of VIT Funds under the VUL contracts. Intersegment expenses for this segment include distribution expenses for services provided by our Advice & Wealth Management segment, as well as expenses for investment management services provided by our Asset Management segment.The following table presents the results of operations of our Protection segment on an operating basis: Three Months Ended March 31,     2015 2014 Change (in millions)  Revenues       Management and financial advice fees$15 $15 $— — %Distribution fees23 23 — —Net investment income114 108 6 6Premiums335 308 27 9Other revenues103 101 2 2Total revenues590 555 35 6Banking and deposit interest expense— — — —Total net revenues590 555 35 6Expenses       Distribution expenses13 14 (1) (7)Interest credited to fixed accounts40 38 2 5Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses380 349 31 9Amortization of deferred acquisition costs36 28 8 29Interest and debt expense8 7 1 14General and administrative expense62 60 2 3Total expenses539 496 43 9Operating earnings$51 $59 $(8) (14)%Our Protection segment pretax operating income, which excludes net realized gains or losses and the market impact on indexed universal life benefits (net of hedges and the related DAC amortization, unearned revenue amortization and the reinsurance accrual), decreased $8 million, or 14%, to $51 million for the three months ended March 31, 2015 compared to $59 million for the prior year period primarily due to a $32 million LTC reserve increase, partially offset by lower auto and home losses and a $7 million favorable impact from a change in the discount rate for disability insurance products.During the quarter, we conducted a review of our LTC reserve for unpaid amounts on reported claims based on additional information we received from Genworth Financial, Inc., which reinsures 50% of our LTC business and administers all of our claims. Based on this information, along with a review of the discount rate, management’s best estimate for LTC claims reserves resulted in a net $32 million increase. The most significant drivers of the reserve increase were updates to the benefit utilization rates and claims termination rates, partially offset by a $15 million benefit from a higher discount rate. We are finalizing our review of LTC claims experience which is expected to be completed in the second quarter. We also increased the discount rate for our DI reserve for unpaid amounts on reported claims, which resulted in a $7 million reserve decrease. The current discount rates are based on the average interest rates earned on assets supporting the liability and were 6.25% and 5.0% for LTC and DI, respectively, at March 31, 2015.Net RevenuesNet revenues, which exclude net realized gains or losses and the unearned revenue amortization and the reinsurance accrual offset to the market impact on indexed universal life benefits, increased $35 million, or 6%, to $590 million for the three months ended March 31, 2015 compared to $555 million for the prior year period primarily due to growth in auto and home premiums.68AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. Premiums increased $27 million, or 9%, to $335 million for the three months ended March 31, 2015 compared to $308 million for the prior year period primarily due to growth in auto and home premiums driven by a 10% increase in auto and home policies in force compared to the prior year period.ExpensesTotal expenses, which exclude the market impact on indexed universal life benefits (net of hedges and the related DAC amortization), increased $43 million, or 9%, to $539 million for the three months ended March 31, 2015 compared to $496 million for the prior year period primarily due to higher benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses. Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses increased $31 million, or 9%, to $380 million for the three months ended March 31, 2015 compared to $349 million for the prior year period primarily due to a $32 million LTC reserve increase, partially offset by a $7 million favorable impact from a change in the discount rate for DI insurance products. Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses related to our auto and home business increased $3 million due to an increase in the provision for estimated losses reflecting the impact of growth in exposures from a 10% increase in policies in force and higher 2015 accident year loss ratio assumptions consistent with the fourth quarter 2014 accident year level, partially offset by a decrease in weather-related losses and a $30 million expense in the prior year period related to an increase to prior accident year loss reserves reflecting adverse development in the 2013 and prior accident years auto liability coverage. Weather-related losses were $12 million for the three months ended March 31, 2015 compared to $20 million for the prior year period. Corporate & OtherOur Corporate & Other segment consists of net investment income or loss on corporate level assets, including excess capital held in our subsidiaries and other unallocated equity and other revenues as well as unallocated corporate expenses. The Corporate & Other segment also includes revenues and expenses of CIEs, which are excluded on an operating basis.The following table presents the results of operations of our Corporate & Other segment on an operating basis: Three Months Ended March 31,     2015 2014 Change (in millions)  Revenues       Distribution fees$— $1 $(1) NMNet investment income (loss)(7) 4 (11) NMOther revenues1 1 — — %Total revenues(6) 6 (12) NMBanking and deposit interest expense— — — —Total net revenues(6) 6 (12) NMExpenses       Interest and debt expense5 4 1 25General and administrative expense51 57 (6) (11)Total expenses56 61 (5) (8)Operating loss$(62) $(55) $(7) (13)%NM Not Meaningful.Our Corporate & Other segment pretax operating loss excludes net realized gains or losses and the impact of consolidating CIEs. Our Corporate & Other segment pretax operating loss increased $7 million, or 13%, to $62 million for the three months ended March 31, 2015 compared to $55 million for the prior year period. Net investment income (loss) was a loss of $7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2015 compared to income of $4 million for the prior year period primarily due to the impact of interest allocation between subsidiaries. General and administrative expense decreased $6 million, or 11%, to $51 million for the three months ended March 31, 2015 compared to $57 million for the prior year period primarily due to lower marketing expenses and investment spending.69AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. Market RiskOur primary market risk exposures are interest rate, equity price, foreign currency exchange rate and credit risk. Equity price and interest rate fluctuations can have a significant impact on our results of operations, primarily due to the effects they have on the asset management and other asset-based fees we earn, the spread income generated on our fixed annuities, fixed insurance, brokerage client cash balances, face-amount certificate products and the fixed portion of our variable annuities and variable insurance contracts, the value of DAC and DSIC assets, the value of liabilities for guaranteed benefits associated with our variable annuities and the value of derivatives held to hedge these benefits.Our earnings from fixed annuities, fixed insurance, and the fixed portion of variable annuities and variable insurance contracts are based upon the spread between rates earned on assets held and the rates at which interest is credited to accounts. We primarily invest in fixed rate securities to fund the rate credited to clients. We guarantee an interest rate to the holders of these products. Investment assets and client liabilities generally differ as it relates to basis, repricing or maturity characteristics. Rates credited to clients’ accounts generally reset at shorter intervals than the yield on the underlying investments. Therefore, in an increasing interest rate environment, higher interest rates may be reflected in crediting rates to clients sooner than in rates earned on invested assets, which could result in a reduced spread between the two rates, reduced earned income and a negative impact on pretax income. However, the current low interest rate environment is resulting in interest rates below the level of some of our liability guaranteed minimum interest rates (“GMIRs”). Hence, a modest rise in interest rates would not necessarily result in changes to all the liability credited rates while projected asset purchases would capture the full increase in interest rates. This dynamic would result in widening spreads under a modestly rising rate scenario given the current relationship between the current level of interest rates and the underlying GMIRs on the business. As a result of the low interest rate environment, our current reinvestment yields are generally lower than the current portfolio yield. We expect our portfolio income yields to continue to decline in future periods if interest rates remain low. The carrying value and weighted average yield of non-structured fixed maturity securities and commercial mortgage loans that may generate proceeds to reinvest through March 31, 2017 due to prepayment, maturity or call activity at the option of the issuer, excluding securities with a make-whole provision, were $3.6 billion and 3.7%, respectively, as of March 31, 2015. In addition, residential mortgage-backed securities, which are subject to prepayment risk as a result of the low interest rate environment, totaled $6.3 billion and had a weighted average yield of 2.9% as of March 31, 2015. While these amounts represent investments that could be subject to reinvestment risk, it is also possible that these investments will be used to fund liabilities or may not be prepaid and will remain invested at their current yields. In addition to the interest rate environment, the mix of benefit payments versus product sales as well as the timing and volumes associated with such mix may impact our investment yield. Furthermore, reinvestment activities and the associated investment yield may also be impacted by corporate strategies implemented at management’s discretion. The average yield for investment purchases during the three months ended March 31, 2015 was approximately 2.9%.The reinvestment of proceeds from maturities, calls and prepayments at rates below the current portfolio yield, which may be below the level of some liability guaranteed minimum interest rates, will have a negative impact to future operating results. To mitigate the unfavorable impact that the low interest rate environment has on our spread income, we assess reinvestment risk in our investment portfolio and monitor this risk in accordance with our asset/liability management framework. In addition, we may reduce the crediting rates on our fixed products when warranted, subject to guaranteed minimums. In 2014, we set lower renewal interest rates for a portion of our fixed annuities that were above the guaranteed minimum interest rates, which helped relieve some of the spread compression caused by low rates.70AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. The following table presents the account values of fixed annuities, fixed insurance, and the fixed portion of variable annuities and variable insurance contracts by range of guaranteed minimum crediting rates and the range of the difference between rates credited to policyholders and contractholders as of March 31, 2015 and the respective guaranteed minimums, as well as the percentage of account values subject to rate reset in the time period indicated. Rates are reset at our discretion, subject to guaranteed minimums.

Each of these guaranteed benefits guarantees payouts to the annuity holder under certain specific conditions regardless of the performance of the underlying invested assets.The variable annuity guarantees continue to be managed by utilizing a hedging program which attempts to match the sensitivity of the assets with the sensitivity of the liabilities. This approach works with the premise that matched sensitivities will produce a highly effective hedging result. Our comprehensive hedging program focuses mainly on first order sensitivities of assets and liabilities: Equity Market Level (Delta), Interest Rate Level (Rho) and Volatility (Vega). Additionally, various second order sensitivities are managed. We use various index options across the term structure, interest rate swaps and swaptions, total return swaps and futures to manage the risk exposures. The exposures are measured and monitored daily, and adjustments to the hedge portfolio are made as necessary.We have a macro hedge program to provide protection against the statutory tail scenario risk arising from variable annuity reserves on our statutory surplus and to cover some of the residual risks not covered by other hedging activities. We assess the residual risk under a range of scenarios in creating and executing the macro hedge program. As a means of economically hedging these risks, we use a combination of options and/or swaps. Certain of the macro hedge derivatives used contain settlement provisions linked to both equity returns and interest rates; the remaining are interest rate contracts or equity contracts. The macro hedge program could result in additional earnings volatility as changes in the value of the macro hedge derivatives, which are designed to reduce statutory capital volatility, may not be closely aligned to changes in the variable annuity guarantee embedded derivatives.To evaluate interest rate and equity price risk we perform sensitivity testing which measures the impact on pretax income from the sources listed below for a 12-month period following a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates or a hypothetical 10% decline in equity prices. The interest rate risk test assumes a sudden 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve, with rates then staying at those levels for the next 12 months. The equity price risk test assumes a sudden 10% drop in equity prices, with equity prices then staying at those levels for the next 12 months. In estimating the values of variable annuity riders, equity indexed annuities, stock market certificates, indexed universal life insurance and the associated hedge assets, we assume no change in implied market volatility despite the 10% drop in equity prices.71AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. The following tables present our estimate of the impact on pretax income from the above defined hypothetical market movements as of March 31, 2015:  Equity Price Exposure to Pretax IncomeEquity Price Decline 10% BeforeHedge Impact Hedge Impact Net Impact  (in millions)Asset-based management and distribution fees (1) $(258) $3 $(255)DAC and DSIC amortization (2) (3) (99) — (99)Variable annuity riders:      GMDB and GMIB (3) (104) — (104)GMWB (241) 250 9GMAB (35) 36 1DAC and DSIC amortization (4) N/A N/A (1)Total variable annuity riders (380) 286 (95)Macro hedge program (5) — 19 19Equity indexed annuities 1 (1) —Certificates 3 (3) —Indexed universal life insurance 26 (24) 2Total $(707) $280 $(428)  Interest Rate Exposure to Pretax IncomeInterest Rate Increase 100 Basis Points Before Hedge Impact Hedge Impact Net Impact  (in millions)Asset-based management and distribution fees (1) $(47) $— $(47)Variable annuity riders:      GMDB and GMIB — — —GMWB 947 (1,039) (92)GMAB 30 (33) (3)DAC and DSIC amortization (4) N/A N/A 16Total variable annuity riders 977 (1,072) (79)Macro hedge program (5) — 13 13Fixed annuities, fixed insurance and fixed portion of variable annuities and variable insurance products 39 — 39Brokerage client cash balances 135 — 135Certificates 3 — 3Indexed universal life insurance 39 1 40Total $1,146 $(1,058) $104N/A Not Applicable.(1) Excludes incentive income which is impacted by market and fund performance during the period and cannot be readily estimated.(2) Market impact on DAC and DSIC amortization resulting from lower projected profits.(3) In estimating the impact on DAC and DSIC amortization resulting from lower projected profits, we have not changed our assumed equity asset growth rates. This is a significantly more conservative estimate than if we assumed management follows its mean reversion guideline and increased near-term rates to recover the drop in equity values over a five-year period. We make this same conservative assumption in estimating the impact from GMDB and GMIB riders.(4) Market impact on DAC and DSIC amortization related to variable annuity riders is modeled net of hedge impact.(5) The market impact of the macro hedge program is modeled net of any related impact to DAC and DSIC amortization.The above results compare to an estimated negative net impact to pretax income of $435 million related to a 10% equity price decline and an estimated positive net impact to pretax income of $89 million related to a 100 basis point increase in interest rates as of December 31, 2014. 72AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. Net impacts shown in the above table from GMWB and GMAB riders result largely from differences between the liability valuation basis and the hedging basis. Liabilities are valued using fair value accounting principles, with risk margins incorporated in contractholder behavior assumptions and with discount rates increased to reflect a current market estimate of our risk of nonperformance specific to these liabilities. The nonperformance spread risk is not hedged.Actual results could differ materially from those illustrated above as they are based on a number of estimates and assumptions. These include assuming that implied market volatility does not change when equity prices fall by 10%, that management does not increase assumed equity asset growth rates to anticipate recovery of the drop in equity values when valuing DAC, DSIC and GMDB and GMIB liability values and that the 100 basis point increase in interest rates is a parallel shift of the yield curve. Furthermore, we have not tried to anticipate changes in client preferences for different types of assets or other changes in client behavior, nor have we tried to anticipate actions management might take to increase revenues or reduce expenses in these scenarios.The selection of a 100 basis point interest rate increase as well as a 10% equity price decline should not be construed as a prediction of future market events. Impacts of larger or smaller changes in interest rates or equity prices may not be proportional to those shown for a 100 basis point increase in interest rates or a 10% decline in equity prices.Fair Value MeasurementsWe report certain assets and liabilities at fair value; specifically, separate account assets, derivatives, embedded derivatives, properties held by our consolidated property funds, and most investments and cash equivalents. Fair value assumes the exchange of assets or liabilities occurs in orderly transactions and is not the result of a forced liquidation or distressed sale. We include actual market prices, or observable inputs, in our fair value measurements to the extent available. Broker quotes are obtained when quotes from pricing services are not available. We validate prices obtained from third parties through a variety of means such as: price variance analysis, subsequent sales testing, stale price review, price comparison across pricing vendors and due diligence reviews of vendors. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our fair value measurements.Fair Value of Liabilities and Nonperformance RiskCompanies are required to measure the fair value of liabilities at the price that would be received to transfer the liability to a market participant (an exit price). Since there is not a market for the obligations of our variable annuity riders and indexed universal life insurance, we consider the assumptions participants in a hypothetical market would make to reflect an exit price. As a result, we adjust the valuation of variable annuity riders and indexed universal life insurance by updating certain contractholder assumptions, adding explicit margins to provide for profit, risk and expenses, and adjusting the rates used to discount expected cash flows to reflect a current market estimate of our nonperformance risk. The nonperformance risk adjustment is based on broker quotes for credit default swaps that are adjusted to estimate the risk of our life insurance company subsidiaries not fulfilling these liabilities. Consistent with general market conditions, this estimate resulted in a spread over the LIBOR swap curve as of March 31, 2015. As our estimate of this spread widens or tightens, the liability will decrease or increase. If this nonperformance credit spread moves to a zero spread over the LIBOR swap curve, the reduction to net income would be approximately $183 million, net of DAC, DSIC, unearned revenue amortization, the reinsurance accrual and income taxes (calculated at the statutory tax rate of 35%), based on March 31, 2015 credit spreads. Liquidity and Capital Resources OverviewWe maintained substantial liquidity during the three months ended March 31, 2015. At March 31, 2015, we had $2.8 billion in cash and cash equivalents compared to $2.6 billion at December 31, 2014. We have additional liquidity available through an unsecured revolving credit facility for up to $500 million. Under the terms of the underlying credit agreement, we can increase this facility to $750 million upon satisfaction of certain approval requirements. Available borrowings under this facility are reduced by any outstanding letters of credit. At March 31, 2015, we had no outstanding borrowings under this credit facility and had $1 million of outstanding letters of credit. On May 1, 2015, we amended the underlying credit agreement for the facility to extend the expiration to May 2020. Our junior subordinated notes due 2066 and credit facility contain various administrative, reporting, legal and financial covenants. We were in compliance with all such covenants at March 31, 2015. We intend to use cash on hand to fund the repayment of $350 million of our senior notes due in November 2015.We enter into short-term borrowings, which may include repurchase agreements and Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) advances, to reduce reinvestment risk from higher levels of expected annuity net cash flows. Short-term borrowings allow us to receive cash to reinvest in longer-duration assets, while paying back the short-term debt with cash flows generated by the fixed income portfolio. The balance of repurchase agreements at both March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 was $50 million, which is collateralized with agency residential mortgage backed securities and commercial mortgage backed securities from our investment portfolio. Our subsidiary, RiverSource Life Insurance Company (“RiverSource Life”), is a member of the FHLB of Des Moines, which provides access to collateralized borrowings. As of both March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, we had $150 million of borrowings from the 73AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. FHLB, which is collateralized with commercial mortgage backed securities. We believe cash flows from operating activities, available cash balances and our availability of revolver borrowings will be sufficient to fund our operating liquidity needs.Dividends from SubsidiariesAmeriprise Financial is primarily a parent holding company for the operations carried out by our wholly owned subsidiaries. Because of our holding company structure, our ability to meet our cash requirements, including the payment of dividends on our common stock, substantially depends upon the receipt of dividends or return of capital from our subsidiaries, particularly our life insurance subsidiary, RiverSource Life, our face-amount certificate subsidiary, Ameriprise Certificate Company (“ACC”), AMPF Holding Corporation, which is the parent company of our retail introducing broker-dealer subsidiary, Ameriprise Financial Services, Inc. (“AFSI”) and our clearing broker-dealer subsidiary, American Enterprise Investment Services, Inc. (“AEIS”), our Auto and Home insurance subsidiary, IDS Property Casualty Insurance Company (“IDS Property Casualty”), doing business as Ameriprise Auto & Home Insurance, our transfer agent subsidiary, Columbia Management Investment Services Corp., our investment advisory company, Columbia Management Investment Advisers, LLC, and Threadneedle. The payment of dividends by many of our subsidiaries is restricted and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to regulatory capital requirements.Actual capital and regulatory capital requirements for our wholly owned subsidiaries subject to regulatory capital requirements were as follows:  Actual Capital Regulatory Capital Requirements March 31, 2015 December 31, 2014 March 31, 2015 December 31, 2014 (in millions)RiverSource Life(1)(2)$3,738 $3,614 N/A $595RiverSource Life of NY(1)(2)331 312 N/A 59IDS Property Casualty(1)(3)737 560 $205 200Ameriprise Insurance Company(1)(3)45 45 2 2ACC(4)(5)249 248 230 226Threadneedle(6)350 221 190 199Ameriprise National Trust Bank(7)38 21 10 10AFSI(3)(4)102 93 # #Ameriprise Captive Insurance Company(3)63 61 14 10Ameriprise Trust Company(3)27 26 25 24AEIS(3)(4)123 117 20 49RiverSource Distributors, Inc.(3)(4)14 13 # #Columbia Management Investment Distributors, Inc.(3)(4)18 18 # #N/A Not applicable.# Amounts are less than $1 million.(1) Actual capital is determined on a statutory basis.(2) Regulatory capital requirement is based on the statutory risk-based capital filing.(3) Regulatory capital requirement is based on the applicable regulatory requirement, calculated as of March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.(4) Actual capital is determined on an adjusted GAAP basis.(5) ACC is required to hold capital in compliance with the Minnesota Department of Commerce and SEC capital requirements.(6) Actual capital and regulatory capital requirements are determined in accordance with U.K. regulatory legislation. The regulatory capital requirements at March 31, 2015 represent calculations at December 31, 2014 of the rule based requirements, as specified by FCA regulations.(7) Ameriprise National Trust Bank is required to maintain capital in compliance with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency regulations and policies.In addition to the particular regulations restricting dividend payments and establishing subsidiary capitalization requirements, we take into account the overall health of the business, capital levels and risk management considerations in determining a dividend strategy for payments to our company from our subsidiaries, and in deciding to use cash to make capital contributions to our subsidiaries.During the three months ended March 31, 2015, the parent holding company received cash dividends or a return of capital from its subsidiaries of $416 million (including $225 million from RiverSource Life) and contributed cash to its subsidiaries of $195 million (including $175 million to IDS Property Casualty). During the three months ended March 31, 2014, the parent holding company received cash dividends or a return of capital from its subsidiaries of $350 million (including $150 million from RiverSource Life) and contributed cash to its subsidiaries of $3 million.74AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. Dividends Paid to Shareholders and Share Repurchases We paid regular quarterly dividends to our shareholders totaling $110 million and $103 million for the three months ended March 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. On April 22, 2015, we announced a quarterly dividend of $0.67 per common share. The dividend will be paid on May 15, 2015 to our shareholders of record at the close of business on May 4, 2015.In April 2014, our Board of Directors authorized an expenditure of up to $2.5 billion for the repurchase of shares of our common stock through April 28, 2016. As of March 31, 2015, the Company had $1.4 billion remaining under its share repurchase authorization. We intend to fund share repurchases through existing working capital, future earnings and other customary financing methods. The share repurchase programs do not require the purchase of any minimum number of shares, and depending on market conditions and other factors, these purchases may be commenced or suspended at any time without prior notice. Acquisitions under the share repurchase programs may be made in the open market, through privately negotiated transactions or block trades or other means. During the three months ended March 31, 2015, we repurchased a total of 2.6 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $131.93 per share.Cash FlowsCash flows of CIEs are reflected in our cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities, investing activities and financing activities. Cash held by CIEs is not available for general use by Ameriprise Financial, nor is Ameriprise Financial cash available for general use by its CIEs. As such, the operating, investing and financing cash flows of the CIEs have no impact to the change in cash and cash equivalents.Operating ActivitiesNet cash provided by operating activities increased $479 million to $913 million for the three months ended March 31, 2015 compared to $434 million for the prior year period primarily due to an increase in cash flows related to changes in amounts due to brokers, changes in cash held by CIEs and changes in other assets, as well as an increase in fee revenue partially offset by related expenses.Investing ActivitiesOur investing activities primarily relate to our Available-for-Sale investment portfolio. Further, this activity is significantly affected by the net flows of our investment certificate, fixed annuity and universal life products reflected in financing activities.Net cash provided by investing activities was $182 million for the three months ended March 31, 2015 compared to net cash used in investing activities of $145 million for the prior year period primarily reflecting a $339 million decrease in purchases of investments by consolidated investment entities.Financing ActivitiesNet cash used in financing activities increased $384 million to $905 million for the three months ended March 31, 2015 compared to $521 million for the prior year period. Cash outflows from policyholder account balances increased $151 million compared to the prior year period primarily due to higher surrenders and other benefits reflecting higher lapse rates. Cash inflows related to changes in debt of CIEs decreased $386 million compared to the prior year period due to $279 million in lower borrowings and $107 million in higher repayments of debt. Net cash outflows from changes in short-term borrowings was nil in the first quarter of 2015 compared to $200 million for the prior year period as we reduced our borrowings from the FHLB during the three months ended March 31, 2014. Contractual CommitmentsThere have been no material changes to our contractual obligations disclosed in our 2014 10-K. Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe provide asset management services to investment entities which are considered to be VIEs, such as CLOs, hedge funds, property funds and private equity funds, which are sponsored by us. We consolidate certain CLOs and property funds. We have determined that consolidation is not required for hedge funds and private equity funds which are sponsored by us. Our maximum exposure to loss with respect to our investment in these non-consolidated entities is limited to our carrying value. We have no obligation to provide further financial or other support to these investment entities nor have we provided any support to these investment entities. See Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our arrangements with these investment entities.75AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURESDisclosure Controls and ProceduresWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be reported in the Exchange Act filings is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in and pursuant to SEC regulations, including controls and procedures designed to ensure that this information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding the required disclosure. It should be noted that, because of inherent limitations, our company’s disclosure controls and procedures, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met.Our management, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, our company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable level of assurance as of March 31, 2015.Changes in Internal Control over Financial ReportingThere have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the fiscal quarter to which this report relates that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our company’s internal control over financial reporting.77AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. PART II. OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGSThe information set forth in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 is incorporated herein by reference.ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSWe are including the following revised risk factor, which should be read in conjunction with our description of risk factors provided in Part I, Item 1A of our 2014 10-K:Our businesses are regulated heavily, and changes to the laws and regulations applicable to our businesses may have an adverse effect on our operations, reputation and financial condition.Virtually all aspects of our business, including the activities of our parent company and our various subsidiaries, are subject to various federal, state and international laws and regulations. For a discussion of the regulatory framework in which we operate, see Item 1 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014 - “Business - Regulation.” Compliance with these applicable laws and regulations is time-consuming and personnel-intensive, and we have invested and will continue to invest substantial resources to ensure compliance by our parent company and our subsidiaries, directors, officers, employees, registered representatives and agents. Any enforcement actions, investigations or other proceedings brought against us or our subsidiaries, directors, employees or advisors by our regulators may result in fines, injunctions or other disciplinary actions that could harm our reputation or impact our results of operations. Further, any changes to the laws and regulations applicable to our businesses, as well as changes to the interpretation and enforcement of such laws and regulations, may affect our operations and financial condition. Such changes may impact our operations and profitability and the practices of our advisors, including with respect to the scope of products and services provided, the manner in which products and services are marketed and sold and the incurrence of additional costs of doing business. Ongoing changes to regulation and oversight of the financial industry may produce results, the full impact of which cannot be immediately ascertained. In addition, we expect the worldwide demographic trend of population aging will cause policymakers to continue to focus on the framework of U.S. and non-U.S. retirement systems, which may drive additional changes regarding the manner in which individuals plan for and fund their retirement, the extent of government involvement in retirement savings and funding, the regulation of retirement products and services and the oversight of industry participants. For example, we continue to see enhanced legislative and regulatory interest regarding retirement investing, and we will continue to closely review and monitor any legislative or regulatory proposals and changes. Any incremental requirements, costs and risks imposed on us in connection with such current or future legislative or regulatory changes may constrain our ability to market our products and services to potential customers, and could negatively impact our profitability and make it more difficult for us to pursue our growth strategy.Certain examples of legislative and regulatory changes that may impact our businesses are described below. Some of the changes resulting from rules and regulations called for under the Dodd-Frank Act could present operational challenges and increase costs. For example, in the area of derivatives, higher margin and capital requirements, coupled with more restrictive collateral rules, could impact our ability to effectively manage and hedge risk. Ultimately these complexities and increased costs could have an impact on our ability to offer cost-effective and innovative insurance products to our clients.As a result of our deregistration as a savings and loan holding company, we are no longer subject to regulation, supervision and examination as such by the Board of Governors for the FRB. However, the Dodd-Frank Act authorizes the Financial Stability Oversight Committee (“FSOC”) to designate certain non-bank institutions as systemically important financial institutions subject to regulation as such by the FRB. In the event we are so designated in the future, we would again be subject to enhanced supervision and prudential standards, including requirements related to risk-based capital, leverage, liquidity, credit exposure, stress-testing, resolution plans, early remediation, and certain risk management requirements. Any such designation could cause us to alter our business practices or otherwise adversely impact our results of operation.In September 2013, at the FSOC’s request, the OFR issued a report entitled “Asset Management and Financial Stability” discussing whether the asset-management industry of selected firms should be subject to enhanced prudential standards and functional supervision. Although the report remains under significant scrutiny, the scope of the FSOC’s focus on the asset management industry continues to evolve, and our asset management businesses are currently under the illustrative assets under management thresholds mentioned in the report as possible triggers for increased supervision, potential impacts on our asset management businesses could include additional reporting requirements, redemption restrictions, imposition of standardized risk management practices, imposition of securities lending and cash collateral reinvestment practices, personnel compensation restrictions, and consolidated supervision of asset managers and their parent companies, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations.78AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. Any mandated reductions or restructuring of the fees we charge for our products and services resulting from regulatory initiatives or proceedings could reduce our revenues and earnings. In the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012, we earned $1.9 billion, $1.8 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively, in distribution fees. Our own Columbia Management family of mutual funds paid a significant portion of these revenues to us in accordance with plans and agreements of distribution adopted under Rule 12b-1 promulgated under the Investment Company Act. We believe that these fees are a critical element in the distribution of our own mutual funds. The SEC has in the past and could again propose measures that would establish a new framework to repeal Rule 12b-1. Any industry-wide reduction or restructuring of Rule 12b-1 fees, or other servicing fees, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to distribute our own mutual funds and the fees we receive for distributing other companies’ mutual funds, which could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our revenues and earnings.On April 20, 2015, the Department of Labor proposed regulations seeking to change the definition of who is an investment advice fiduciary under ERISA and how such advice can be provided to account holders in 401(k) plans and IRAs. Qualified accounts, specifically IRAs, make up a significant portion of our assets under management and administration. We are currently reviewing and analyzing the potential impact of the proposed regulations on our clients and prospective clients who save through retirement accounts, as well as the potential impact on our business. These regulations focus on conflicts of interest related to investment recommendations made by financial advisors to clients holding qualified accounts and also on how financial advisors are able to discuss IRA rollovers. These proposed regulations are subject to a 75-day public comment period ending on July 6, 2015. The Department of Labor has announced that there will be a public hearing within 30 days after the end of the public comment period and that the comment period will be reopened after the hearing. We cannot predict whether or when the regulations may be finalized, or how any final regulations may differ from the proposed regulation. If final regulations were to be issued with provisions substantially similar to the proposed regulations, they could impact how we receive fees, how we compensate our advisors, how we are able to retain advisors, and how we design our investments and services for qualified accounts, any of which could negatively impact our results of operations.Our insurance companies are subject to state regulation and must comply with statutory reserve and capital requirements. State regulators, as well as the NAIC, continually review and update these requirements and other requirements relating to the business operations of insurance companies, including their underwriting and sales practices and their use of affiliated captive insurers. Changes in these requirements that are made for the benefit of the consumer sometimes lead to additional expense for the insurer and, thus, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In December 2012, the NAIC adopted a new reserve valuation manual that applies principles-based reserve standards to life insurance products. The valuation manual becomes the effective reserve valuation method when adopted by 42 jurisdictions that account for at least 75% of U.S. insurance premiums combined. To date, 29 states have adopted the valuation manual. The requirement for principles-based life insurance reserves may result in statutory reserves being more sensitive to changes in interest rates, policyholder behavior and other market factors. It is not possible at this time to estimate the potential impact of future changes in statutory reserve and capital requirements on our insurance businesses. Further, we cannot predict the effect that proposed federal legislation, such as the option of federally chartered insurers or a mandated federal systemic risk regulator, or future initiatives of the FIO within the Department of the Treasury, may have on our insurance businesses or competitors. For additional discussion on the role and activities of the FIO, see the information provided under the heading “Regulation - Insurance Regulation” contained in Part I, Item 1 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014.79AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC.
