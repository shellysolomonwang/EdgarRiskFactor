Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2014 10-K, “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2015 filed with the SEC on May 4, 2015 and other factors as discussed herein.Equity price, credit market and interest rate fluctuations can have a significant impact on our results of operations, primarily due to the effects they have on the asset management and other asset-based fees we earn, the “spread” income generated on our fixed annuities, fixed insurance, deposit products and the fixed portion of variable annuities and variable insurance contracts, the value of deferred acquisition costs (“DAC”) and deferred sales inducement costs (“DSIC”) assets, the values of liabilities for guaranteed benefits associated with our variable annuities and the values of derivatives held to hedge these benefits.Earnings, as well as operating earnings, will continue to be negatively impacted by the ongoing low interest rate environment. In addition to continuing spread compression in our interest sensitive product lines, a sustained low interest rate environment may result in increases to our reserves and changes in various rate assumptions we use to amortize DAC and DSIC, which may negatively impact our operating earnings. For additional discussion on our interest rate risk, see Item 3. “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.”In the third quarter of the year, we conduct our annual review of life insurance and annuity valuation assumptions relative to current experience and management expectations. To the extent that expectations change as a result of this review, we update valuation assumptions and the impact is reflected as part of our annual review of life insurance and annuity valuation assumptions and modeling changes (“unlocking”). The favorable unlocking impact in the third quarter of 2015 primarily reflected improved policyholder behavior, an update to market-related inputs related to our living benefit valuation and model changes that more than offset the difference between our previously assumed interest rates versus the continued low interest rate environment. In addition, our annual review of our closed long term care business resulted in no loss recognition as better-than-expected premium increases offset higher morbidity and lower interest rates. The unfavorable unlocking impact in the third quarter of 2014 primarily reflected assumed interest rates, partially offset by a benefit from updating our variable annuity living benefit withdrawal utilization assumption. See our Consolidated and Segment Results of Operations sections below for the pretax impacts on our revenues and expenses attributable to unlocking and additional discussion of the drivers of the unlocking impact.We consolidate certain collateralized loan obligations (“CLOs”) and property funds (pooled investment vehicles) for which we provide asset management services. These entities are defined as consolidated investment entities (“CIEs”). While the consolidation of the CIEs impacts our balance sheet and income statement, our exposure to these entities is unchanged and there is no impact to the underlying business results. For further information on CIEs, see Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Changes in the valuation of the CIE assets and liabilities impact pretax income. The net income (loss) of the CIEs is reflected in net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests. The results of operations of the CIEs are reflected in the Corporate & Other segment. On a consolidated basis, the management fees we earn for the services we provide to the CIEs and the related general and administrative expenses are eliminated and the changes in the assets and liabilities related to the CIEs, primarily syndicated loans and debt, are reflected in net investment income. We continue to include the fees from these entities in the management and financial advice fees line within our Asset Management segment.While our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), management believes that operating measures, which exclude net realized investment gains or losses, net of the related DSIC and DAC amortization, unearned revenue amortization and the reinsurance accrual; the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits, net of hedges and the related DSIC and DAC amortization; the market impact on indexed universal life benefits, net of 56AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. hedges and the related DAC amortization, unearned revenue amortization and the reinsurance accrual; the market impact of hedges to offset interest rate changes on unrealized gains or losses for certain investments; integration and restructuring charges; income (loss) from discontinued operations; and the impact of consolidating CIEs, best reflect the underlying performance of our core operations and facilitate a more meaningful trend analysis. Management uses certain of these non-GAAP measures to evaluate our financial performance on a basis comparable to that used by some securities analysts and investors. Also, certain of these non-GAAP measures are taken into consideration, to varying degrees, for purposes of business planning and analysis and for certain compensation-related matters. Throughout our Management’s Discussion and Analysis, these non-GAAP measures are referred to as operating measures.It is management’s priority to increase shareholder value over a multi-year horizon by achieving our on-average, over-time financial targets.Our financial targets are:•Operating total net revenue growth of 6% to 8%,•Operating earnings per diluted share growth of 12% to 15%, and•Operating return on equity excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) of 19% to 23%.The following tables reconcile our GAAP measures to operating measures: Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015 2014 2015 2014 (in millions)Total net revenues$2,886 $3,111 $9,067 $9,179Less: Revenue attributable to CIEs43 206 333 543Less: Net realized gains (losses)(10) 4 5 10Less: Market impact on indexed universal life benefits9 2 5 —Less: Market impact of hedges on investments(31) — (32) —Operating total net revenues$2,875 $2,899 $8,756 $8,626     Per Diluted Share Three Months Ended September 30, Three Months Ended September 30, 2015 2014 2015 2014 (in millions, except per share amounts)Net income$352 $565    Less: Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests(45) 145    Net income attributable to Ameriprise Financial397 420 $2.17 $2.17Less: Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax— — — —Net income from continuing operations attributable to Ameriprise Financial397 420 2.17 2.17Add: Integration/restructuring charges, net of tax (1)2 — 0.01 —Add: Market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits, net of tax (1)3 (5) 0.02 (0.03)Add: Market impact on indexed universal life benefits, net of tax (1)— (5) — (0.03)Add: Market impact of hedges on investments, net of tax (1)20 — 0.11 —Less: Net realized gains (losses), net of tax (1)(7) 3 (0.04) 0.01Operating earnings$429 $407 $2.35 $2.10        Weighted average common shares outstanding:       Basic180.4 190.3    Diluted182.7 193.7    (1) Calculated using the statutory tax rate of 35%.57AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC.

Critical Accounting PoliciesThe accounting and reporting policies that we use affect our Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of our accounting and reporting policies are critical to an understanding of our consolidated results of operations and financial condition. In some cases, the application of these policies can be significantly affected by the estimates, judgments and assumptions made by management during the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements. These accounting policies are discussed in detail in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis — Critical Accounting Policies” in our 2014 10-K.Recent Accounting PronouncementsFor information regarding recent accounting pronouncements and their expected impact on our future consolidated results of operations and financial condition, see Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Assets Under Management and AdministrationAssets under management (“AUM”) include external client assets for which we provide investment management services, such as the assets of the Columbia funds and Threadneedle funds, assets of institutional clients and assets of clients in our advisor platform held in wrap accounts as well as assets managed by sub-advisers selected by us. AUM also includes certain assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets for which we provide investment management services and recognize management fees in our Asset Management segment, such as the assets of the general account and the variable product funds held in the separate accounts of our life insurance subsidiaries and CIEs. These assets do not include assets under advisement, for which we provide model portfolios but do not have full discretionary investment authority. Corporate & Other AUM primarily includes former bank assets that are managed within our Corporate & Other segment.Assets under administration (“AUA”) include assets for which we provide administrative services such as client assets invested in other companies’ products that we offer outside of our wrap accounts. These assets include those held in clients’ brokerage accounts. We generally record revenues received from administered assets as distribution fees. We do not exercise management discretion over these assets and do not earn a management fee. These assets are not reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. AUA also includes certain assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets for which we do not provide investment management services and do not recognize management fees, such as investments in non-affiliated funds held in the separate accounts of our life insurance subsidiaries. These assets do not include assets under advisement, for which we provide model portfolios but do not have full discretionary investment authority.The following table presents detail regarding our AUM and AUA: September 30,   2015 2014 Change (in billions)  Assets Under Management and Administration       Advice & Wealth Management AUM$173.0 $168.7 $4.3 3 %Asset Management AUM471.1 504.8 (33.7) (7)Corporate & Other AUM0.7 0.9 (0.2) (22)Eliminations(22.2) (21.7) (0.5) (2)Total Assets Under Management622.6 652.7 (30.1) (5)Total Assets Under Administration143.2 144.1 (0.9) (1)Total AUM and AUA$765.8 $796.8 $(31.0) (4)%Total AUM decreased $30.1 billion, or 5%, to $622.6 billion as of September 30, 2015 compared to $652.7 billion as of September 30, 2014 reflecting a $33.7 billion decrease in Asset Management AUM driven by the negative impact of foreign currency translation, net outflows, market depreciation and retail fund distributions, and a $4.3 billion increase in Advice & Wealth Management AUM driven by wrap account net inflows, partially offset by market depreciation.

Consolidated Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2015 and 2014 The following table presents our consolidated results of operations: Three Months Ended September 30,   2015 2014 Change (in millions)  Revenues       Management and financial advice fees$1,465 $1,483 $(18) (1)%Distribution fees451 464 (13) (3)Net investment income321 428 (107) (25)Premiums360 351 9 3Other revenues296 392 (96) (24)Total revenues2,893 3,118 (225) (7)Banking and deposit interest expense7 7 — —Total net revenues2,886 3,111 (225) (7)Expenses       Distribution expenses806 813 (7) (1)Interest credited to fixed accounts171 168 3 2Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses471 458 13 3Amortization of deferred acquisition costs133 116 17 15Interest and debt expense98 79 19 24General and administrative expense744 757 (13) (2)Total expenses2,423 2,391 32 1Income from continuing operations before income tax provision463 720 (257) (36)Income tax provision111 155 (44) (28)Income from continuing operations352 565 (213) (38)Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax— — — —Net income352 565 (213) (38)Less: Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests(45) 145 (190) NMNet income attributable to Ameriprise Financial$397 $420 $(23) (5)%NM Not Meaningful.OverallIncome from continuing operations before income tax provision decreased $257 million, or 36%, to $463 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 compared to $720 million for the prior year period primarily reflecting a $190 million decrease in net income from CIEs, asset management net outflows, the unfavorable market impact of hedges on investments, higher life insurance claims, an increase in auto and home reserves, fixed annuity net outflows, a negative impact of foreign exchange, net realized investment losses of $10 million for the third quarter of 2015 compared to net realized investment gains of $4 million for the prior year period, and the impact on DAC and DSIC from actual versus expected market performance, partially offset by the favorable impact of unlocking, wrap account net inflows and lower compensation-related expense. The market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits (net of hedges and the related DSIC and DAC amortization) was an expense of $5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 compared to a benefit of $9 million for the prior year period. The impact on DAC and DSIC from actual versus expected market performance based on our view of bond and equity performance was an expense of $31 million for the third quarter of 2015 compared to an expense of $6 million for the prior year period primarily due to more unfavorable equity market returns compared to the prior year period.60AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. The following table presents the total pretax impacts on our revenues and expenses attributable to unlocking for the three months ended September 30:Pretax Increase (Decrease) 2015 2014  (in millions)Premiums $(3) $—Other revenues 8 (29)Total revenues 5 (29)     Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses (58) 6Amortization of DAC 15 8Total expenses (43) 14Total (1) $48 $(43)(1) Includes a $6 million net benefit related to the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits and indexed universal life benefits for the three months ended September 30, 2015.Net RevenuesNet revenues decreased $225 million, or 7%, to $2.9 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2015 compared to $3.1 billion for the prior year period primarily due to decreases in net investment income and other revenues.Management and financial advice fees decreased $18 million, or 1%, to $1.5 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2015 compared to $1.5 billion for the prior year period primarily due to lower asset-based fees driven by a decrease in average AUM. Average AUM decreased $13.2 billion, or 2%, compared to the prior year period primarily due to asset management net outflows and the negative impact of foreign currency translation, partially offset by market appreciation and wrap account net inflows. See our discussion on the changes in AUM in our segment results of operations section.Net investment income decreased $107 million, or 25%, to $321 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 compared to $428 million for the prior year period primarily due to a $39 million decrease in net investment income of CIEs, a $19 million decrease in investment income on fixed maturities driven by low interest rates and a $31 million loss related to the market impact of hedges on investments. In addition, net realized investment losses were $10 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 compared to net realized investment gains of $4 million for the prior year period.Other revenues decreased $96 million, or 24%, to $296 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 compared to $392 million for the prior year period due to a $124 million decrease in other revenues of CIEs, partially offset by the impact of unlocking. Other revenues for the third quarter of 2015 included an $8 million favorable impact from unlocking compared to a $29 million negative impact in the prior year period. The primary driver of the unlocking impact to other revenues for the third quarter of 2015 was a positive impact from model updates related to our indexed universal life product, partially offset by a negative impact from lower projected gains on reinsurance contracts resulting from favorable mortality experience. The primary driver of the unlocking impact to other revenues for the prior year period was lower projected gains on reinsurance contracts resulting from favorable mortality experience.ExpensesTotal expenses increased $32 million, or 1%, to $2.4 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2015 compared to $2.4 billion for the prior year period.Interest credited to fixed accounts increased $3 million, or 2%, to $171 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 compared to $168 million for the prior year period primarily due to the market impact on indexed universal life benefits, net of hedges, which was an expense of $4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 and a benefit of $7 million for the prior year period, partially offset by lower average fixed annuity account balances. Average fixed annuity account balances decreased $1.4 billion, or 12%, to $11.0 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2015 compared to the prior year period due to net outflows reflecting higher lapse rates and limited new sales due to low interest rates.Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses increased $13 million, or 3%, to $471 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 compared to $458 million for the prior year period primarily reflecting the following items:•The three months ended September 30, 2015 included a $58 million benefit from unlocking compared to a $6 million expense in the prior year period. The unlocking impact for the third quarter of 2015 primarily reflected an update to market-related inputs related to our living benefit valuation and a benefit from model changes that more than offset the difference between our previously assumed interest rates versus the continued low interest rate environment. The unlocking impact for the prior year 61AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. period reflected assumed interest rates, partially offset by a benefit from updating our variable annuity living benefit withdrawal utilization assumption. •A $37 million increase in benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses related to our auto and home business due to an increase in the provision for estimated losses reflecting the impact of growth in exposures from a 5% increase in policies in force, higher 2015 accident year loss ratio assumptions, and approximately $10 million in expense primarily related to deterioration in auto collision experience resulting from an increase in miles driven and lower salvage values, as well as losses associated with our travel insurance business and $5 million related to prior year catastrophe reserve development associated with hail storms from last year. Our travel accident program is a small program we piloted but did not meet our profitability targets. Therefore, we are in the process of exiting this product line. Catastrophe losses were $8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 compared to $14 million for the prior year period. •A $13 million decrease related to a long-term care (“LTC”) future loss reserve adjustment in the third quarter of 2015.•A $14 million increase in life insurance claims compared to the prior year period. Life insurance claims were higher in the third quarter of 2015 as a result of claims from several large, later duration policies that had limited reinsurance coverage. In addition, life insurance claims experience was favorable in the prior year period.•A $117 million decrease in expense compared to the prior year period from the unhedged nonperformance credit spread risk adjustment on variable annuity guaranteed benefits. As the embedded derivative liability on which the nonperformance credit spread is applied increases (decreases), the impact of the nonperformance credit spread is favorable (unfavorable) to expense. The favorable impact of the nonperformance credit spread was $185 million for the third quarter of 2015 compared to a favorable impact of $68 million for the prior year period.•A $131 million increase in expense from other market impacts on variable annuity guaranteed benefits, net of hedges in place to offset those risks and the related DSIC amortization. This increase was the result of an unfavorable $748 million change in the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits reserves, a favorable $618 million change in the market impact on derivatives hedging the variable annuity guaranteed benefits and an unfavorable $1 million DSIC offset. The main market drivers contributing to these changes are summarized below:•Interest rates were down more in the third quarter of 2015 than in the third quarter of 2014 resulting in a larger unfavorable change in the variable annuity guaranteed living benefits liability net of the corresponding change in hedge assets relative to the prior year period. •Equity market impact on the variable annuity guaranteed living benefits liability net of the impact on the corresponding hedge assets resulted in an increase in expense in the third quarter of 2015 compared to a modest benefit for the prior year period.•Equity volatility impact on the variable annuity guaranteed living benefits liability net of the impact on the corresponding hedge assets resulted in a higher benefit in the third quarter of 2015 compared to the prior year period.•Other unhedged items, including the difference between the assumed and actual underlying separate account investment performance, fixed income credit exposures, transaction costs and various behavioral items, were a net unfavorable impact compared to the prior year period.Amortization of DAC increased $17 million, or 15%, to $133 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 compared to $116 million for the prior year period. The impact on DAC from actual versus expected market performance based on our view of bond and equity performance was an expense of $25 million for the third quarter of 2015 compared to an expense of $5 million for the prior year period primarily due to more unfavorable equity market returns compared to the prior year period.Interest and debt expense increased $19 million, or 24%, to $98 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 compared to $79 million for the prior year period primarily due to an increase in interest and debt expense of CIEs.General and administrative expenses decreased $13 million, or 2%, to $744 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 compared to $757 million for the prior year period primarily due to lower compensation-related expense, partially offset by a $13 million increase in expenses of CIEs.Income TaxesOur effective tax rate on income from continuing operations including income attributable to noncontrolling interests was 24.1% for the three months ended September 30, 2015 compared to 21.6% for the prior year period. Our effective tax rate on income from continuing operations excluding income attributable to noncontrolling interests was 21.9% for the three months ended September 30, 2015 compared to 27.0% for the prior year period. The effective tax rates for the three months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014 were lower than the statutory rate as a result of tax preferred items including the dividends received deduction and low income housing tax credits. 62AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. Results of Operations by Segment for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2015 and 2014 Operating earnings is the measure of segment profit or loss management uses to evaluate segment performance. Operating earnings should not be viewed as a substitute for GAAP income from continuing operations before income tax provision. We believe the presentation of segment operating earnings as we measure it for management purposes enhances the understanding of our business by reflecting the underlying performance of our core operations and facilitating a more meaningful trend analysis. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the presentation of segment results and our definition of operating earnings.The following table presents summary financial information by segment: Three Months Ended September 30, 2015 2014 (in millions)Advice & Wealth Management   Net revenues$1,245 $1,210Expenses1,026 1,005Operating earnings$219 $205Asset Management   Net revenues$782 $839Expenses602 631Operating earnings$180 $208Annuities   Net revenues$632 $655Expenses456 527Operating earnings$176 $128Protection   Net revenues$586 $553Expenses561 487Operating earnings$25 $66Corporate & Other   Net revenues$(4) $(1)Expenses38 52Operating loss$(42) $(53)The following table presents the segment pretax operating impacts on our revenues and expenses attributable to unlocking:  Three Months Ended September 30,Segment Pretax Operating Increase (Decrease) 2015 2014 Annuities Protection Annuities Protection  (in millions)Premiums $— $(3) $— $—Other revenues — (5) — (29)Total revenues — (8) — (29)         Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses (61) 6 5 1Amortization of DAC (5) 10 17 (9)Total expenses (66) 16 22 (8)Total $66 $(24) $(22) $(21)63AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. Advice & Wealth ManagementOur Advice & Wealth Management segment provides financial planning and advice, as well as full-service brokerage services, primarily to retail clients through our advisors. These services are centered on long-term, personal relationships between our advisors and our clients and focus on helping clients confidently achieve their financial goals. Our advisors provide a distinctive approach to financial planning and have access to a broad selection of both affiliated and non-affiliated products to help clients meet their financial needs. A significant portion of revenues in this segment is fee-based, driven by the level of client assets, which is impacted by both market movements and net asset flows. We also earn net investment income on invested assets primarily from certificate products. This segment earns revenues (distribution fees) for distributing non-affiliated products and intersegment revenues (distribution fees) for distributing our affiliated products and services to our retail clients. Intersegment expenses for this segment include expenses for investment management services provided by the Asset Management segment.In addition to purchases of affiliated and non-affiliated mutual funds and other securities on a stand-alone basis, clients may purchase mutual funds, among other securities, in connection with investment advisory fee-based “wrap account” programs or services, and pay fees based on a percentage of their assets.The following table presents the changes in wrap account assets and average balances for the three months ended September 30: 2015 2014 (in billions)Beginning balance$181.9 $167.8Net flows3.0 3.8Market depreciation and other(11.1) (2.4)Ending balance$173.8 $169.2    Advisory wrap account assets ending balance (1)$172.3 $168.2Average advisory wrap account assets (2)$177.7 $167.7(1) Advisory wrap account assets represent those assets for which clients receive advisory services and are the primary driver of revenue earned on wrap accounts. Clients may hold non-advisory investments in their wrap accounts that do not incur an advisory fee.(2) Average ending balances are calculated using an average of the prior period’s ending balance and all months in the current period.Wrap account assets decreased $8.1 billion, or 4%, during the three months ended September 30, 2015 due to market depreciation and other of $11.1 billion, partially offset by net inflows of $3.0 billion. Average advisory wrap account assets increased $10.0 billion, or 6%, compared to the prior year period primarily due to net inflows.The following table presents the changes in wrap account assets for the twelve months ended September 30: 2015 2014 (in billions)Beginning balance$169.2 $144.1Net flows (1)12.2 13.9Market appreciation (depreciation) and other (1)(7.6) 11.2Ending balance$173.8 $169.2(1) Beginning April 1, 2014, net flows reflect all additions and withdrawals to and from the SPS wrap account program. For all periods presented prior to April 1, 2014, additions and withdrawals to and from certain non-billable investments of this program were reflected in the Market appreciation and other line and purchases and sales of billable investments were reported in the Net flows line. Nets flows for the SPS program are now reported on a consistent basis with our other wrap account programs.Wrap account assets increased $4.6 billion, or 3%, from the prior year period reflecting net inflows, partially offset by market depreciation.64AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC.

We provide clients with U.S. domestic individual products through unaffiliated third party financial institutions and through our Advice & Wealth Management segment, and we provide institutional products and services through our institutional sales force. International retail products are primarily distributed through third-party financial institutions and unaffiliated financial advisors. Individual products include U.S. mutual funds and non-U.S. equivalents, exchange-traded funds and variable product funds underlying insurance and annuity separate accounts. Institutional asset management services are designed to meet specific client objectives and may involve a range of products, including those that focus on traditional asset classes, separately managed accounts, individually managed accounts, collateralized loan obligations, hedge funds, collective funds and property funds. Collateralized loan obligations, hedge funds and certain private funds are often classified as alternative assets. Revenues in this segment are primarily earned as fees based on managed asset balances, which are impacted by market movements, net asset flows, asset allocation and product mix. We may also earn performance fees from certain accounts where 65AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. investment performance meets or exceeds certain pre-identified targets. Our Asset Management segment also provides intercompany asset management services for Ameriprise Financial subsidiaries. The fees for such services are reflected within the Asset Management segment results through intersegment transfer pricing. Intersegment expenses for this segment include distribution expenses for services provided by our Advice & Wealth Management, Annuities and Protection segments.From time to time, fee waivers have been provided to the Columbia Money Market Funds (the “Funds”) by Columbia Management and certain other subsidiaries performing services for the Funds for the purpose of reducing the expenses charged to a Fund in a given period to maintain or improve a Fund’s net yield in that period. Our subsidiaries may enter into contractual arrangements with the Funds identifying the specific fees to be waived and/or expenses to be reimbursed, as well as the time period for which such waivers will apply. In aggregate, we voluntarily waived fees of $2 million for both the three months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014.The following tables present the mutual fund performance of our retail Columbia and Threadneedle funds as of September 30:ColumbiaMutual Fund Rankings in top 2 Lipper Quartiles    2015 2014Domestic EquityEqual weighted 1 year 57% 66%   3 year 65% 73%   5 year 57% 54% Asset weighted 1 year 59% 62%   3 year 72% 68%   5 year 70% 60%        International EquityEqual weighted 1 year 68% 73%   3 year 73% 59%   5 year 70% 60% Asset weighted 1 year 35% 87%   3 year 42% 40%   5 year 40% 38%        Taxable Fixed IncomeEqual weighted 1 year 58% 44%   3 year 59% 56%   5 year 71% 59% Asset weighted 1 year 72% 66%   3 year 82% 69%   5 year 85% 70%        Tax Exempt Fixed IncomeEqual weighted 1 year 94% 94%   3 year 100% 94%   5 year 100% 100% Asset weighted 1 year 99% 84%   3 year 100% 84%   5 year 100% 100%        Asset Allocation FundsEqual weighted 1 year 90% 58%   3 year 67% 64%   5 year 88% 89% Asset weighted 1 year 100% 65%   3 year 73% 75%   5 year 97% 97%        66AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC.

Total segment AUM net outflows were $7.4 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Management expects, consistent with prior patterns of outflows, that outflows of primarily low margin assets directly or indirectly affiliated with Threadneedle and Columbia former parent companies will continue for the foreseeable future. The overall impact to segment results is difficult to quantify due to uncertain timing, volume and mix of the outflows. Columbia managed assets decreased $22.3 billion, or 6%, during the three months ended September 30, 2015 primarily due to market depreciation and net outflows. Columbia retail funds decreased $18.9 billion, or 8%, during the three months ended September 30, 2015 primarily due to market depreciation and net outflows. Columbia retail net outflows of $4.1 billion during the third quarter of 2015 included $1.3 billion related to a client’s decision to exit its portfolio due to asset allocation and $0.5 billion of outflows from a former parent affiliated distribution relationship. We expect outflows in former parent affiliated assets to continue in the fourth quarter with additional outflows in low-fee common trust funds given U.S. Trust’s decision to manage a portion of these fixed income products in house. Underlying Columbia retail outflows were largely driven by $1.6 billion of outflows from the Columbia Acorn Fund as well as market volatility in the quarter that decreased investor demand. Outflows from the Columbia Acorn Fund have 70AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. persisted and while investment performance has improved year to date, in the near term we expect that outflows may continue. Columbia institutional AUM decreased $4.0 billion, or 5%, during the three months ended September 30, 2015 due to market depreciation of $2.7 billion and net outflows of $1.3 billion primarily reflecting outflows from former parent affiliated distribution and former parent influenced mandates.Threadneedle managed assets decreased $11.5 billion, or 8%, during the three months ended September 30, 2015 primarily due to a $5.5 billion negative impact of foreign currency translation, market depreciation of $3.1 billion and net outflows of $3.6 billion. Threadneedle retail funds decreased $4.4 billion, or 9%, during the three months ended September 30, 2015 due to a $1.8 billion negative impact of foreign currency translation, market depreciation of $1.4 billion and net outflows of $1.2 billion. Threadneedle institutional AUM decreased $7.2 billion, or 7%, during the three months ended September 30, 2015 primarily due to a $3.7 billion negative impact of foreign currency translation, market depreciation of $1.7 billion and net outflows of $2.4 billion. Threadneedle institutional net outflows during the third quarter of 2015 included outflows of $0.8 billion from legacy insurance assets and $2.0 billion related to a client’s decision to exit its portfolio due to specific liquidity needs, partially offset by new third party mandates.

Net RevenuesNet revenues, which exclude net realized investment gains or losses, decreased $57 million, or 7%, to $782 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 compared to $839 million for the prior year period primarily due to a decrease in management and financial advice fees.Management and financial advice fees decreased $50 million, or 7%, to $656 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 compared to $706 million for the prior year period primarily due to lower asset-based fees driven by a decrease in average AUM, a $13 million negative impact of foreign exchange, and a $9 million decrease in performance fees. Average AUM decreased $22.0 billion, or 4%, compared to the prior year period primarily due to net outflows and the negative impact of foreign currency translation, partially offset by market appreciation.ExpensesTotal expenses decreased $29 million, or 5%, to $602 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 compared to $631 million for the prior year period due to an $18 million decrease in distribution expenses from lower retail fund assets and an $11 million decrease in general and administrative expense due to lower compensation-related costs. 71AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. AnnuitiesOur Annuities segment provides variable and fixed annuity products of RiverSource Life companies to individual clients. We provide our variable annuity products through our advisors, and our fixed annuity products are distributed through both affiliated and unaffiliated advisors and financial institutions. Revenues from our variable annuity products are primarily earned as fees based on underlying account balances, which are impacted by both market movements and net asset flows. Revenues from our fixed annuity products are primarily earned as net investment income on assets supporting fixed account balances, with profitability significantly impacted by the spread between net investment income earned and interest credited on the fixed account balances. We also earn net investment income on owned assets supporting reserves for immediate annuities and for certain guaranteed benefits offered with variable annuities and on capital supporting the business. Intersegment revenues for this segment reflect fees paid by our Asset Management segment for marketing support and other services provided in connection with the availability of variable insurance trust funds (“VIT Funds”) under the variable annuity contracts. Intersegment expenses for this segment include distribution expenses for services provided by our Advice & Wealth Management segment, as well as expenses for investment management services provided by our Asset Management segment.The following table presents the results of operations of our Annuities segment on an operating basis: Three Months Ended September 30,     2015 2014 Change (in millions)  Revenues       Management and financial advice fees$187 $191 $(4) (2)%Distribution fees91 91 — —Net investment income208 235 (27) (11)Premiums25 26 (1) (4)Other revenues121 112 9 8Total revenues632 655 (23) (4)Banking and deposit interest expense— — — —Total net revenues632 655 (23) (4)Expenses       Distribution expenses111 110 1 1Interest credited to fixed accounts125 136 (11) (8)Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses89 136 (47) (35)Amortization of deferred acquisition costs66 78 (12) (15)Interest and debt expense10 9 1 11General and administrative expense55 58 (3) (5)Total expenses456 527 (71) (13)Operating earnings$176 $128 $48 38 %Our Annuities segment pretax operating income, which excludes net realized investment gains or losses (net of the related DSIC and DAC amortization) and the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits (net of hedges and the related DSIC and DAC amortization), increased $48 million, or 38%, to $176 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 compared to $128 million for the prior year period primarily due to the impact of unlocking, partially offset by the impact on DAC and DSIC from actual versus expected market performance and the negative impact from lower invested assets due to fixed annuity net outflows. The impact of unlocking was an increase to pretax operating income of $66 million for the third quarter of 2015 compared to a decrease of $22 million for the prior year period. The impact on DAC and DSIC from actual versus expected market performance based on our view of bond and equity performance was an expense of $29 million for the third quarter of 2015 compared to an expense of $6 million for the prior year period primarily due to more unfavorable equity market returns compared to the prior year period.RiverSource variable annuity account balances decreased 4% to $72.8 billion at September 30, 2015 compared to the prior year period due to net outflows of $1.4 billion and market depreciation. RiverSource fixed annuity account balances declined 12% to $10.9 billion at September 30, 2015 compared to the prior year period reflecting limited new sales from low interest rates and higher lapse rates related to the re-pricing of the five-year guarantee block during 2014, a portion of which came out of its surrender charge period earlier in 2015. The change in crediting rates decreased the level of spread compression in both periods. 72AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. Net RevenuesNet revenues, which exclude net realized investment gains or losses, decreased $23 million, or 4%, to $632 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 compared to $655 million for the prior year period primarily due to lower net investment income.Net investment income, which excludes net realized investment gains or losses, decreased $27 million, or 11%, to $208 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 compared to $235 million for the prior year period primarily reflecting lower invested assets due to fixed annuity net outflows.Other revenues increased $9 million, or 8%, to $121 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 compared to $112 million for the prior year period due to higher fees from variable annuity guarantee sales in the prior year where the fees start on the first anniversary date and higher average fee rates.ExpensesTotal expenses, which exclude the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits (net of hedges and the related DSIC and DAC amortization) and the DAC and DSIC offset to net realized investment gains or losses, decreased $71 million, or 13%, to $456 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 compared to $527 million for the prior year period primarily due to the impact of unlocking and a decrease in interested credited to fixed accounts, partially offset by the impact on DAC and DSIC from actual versus expected market performance. Interest credited to fixed accounts decreased $11 million, or 8%, to $125 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 compared to $136 million for the prior year period driven by lower average fixed annuity account balances. Average fixed annuity account balances decreased $1.4 billion, or 12%, to $11.0 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2015 compared to the prior year period due to net outflows reflecting higher lapse rates and limited new sales due to low interest rates.Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses, which exclude the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits (net of hedges and the related DSIC amortization) and the DSIC offset to net realized investment gains or losses, decreased $47 million, or 35%, to $89 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 compared to $136 million for the prior year period primarily reflecting the following items: •Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses for the third quarter of 2015 included a $61 million benefit from unlocking primarily reflecting an update to market-related inputs related to our living benefit valuation and a benefit from model changes that more than offset the difference between our previously assumed interest rates versus the continued low interest rate environment. Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses for the third quarter of 2014 included a $5 million expense from unlocking primarily reflecting assumed interest rates, partially offset by a benefit from updating our variable annuity living benefit withdrawal utilization assumption.•A $4 million increase in expense related to higher reserve funding driven by the impact of higher fees from variable annuity guarantee sales in the prior year where the fees start on the first anniversary date.•A $5 million increase in expense compared to the prior year period due to the impact on DSIC from actual versus expected market performance based on our view of bond and equity performance. This impact was an expense of $6 million for the third quarter of 2015 compared to an expense of $1 million for the prior year period primarily due to more unfavorable equity market returns compared to the prior year period.Amortization of DAC, which excludes the DAC offset to the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits and the DAC offset to net realized investment gains or losses, decreased $12 million, or 15%, to $66 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 compared to $78 million for the prior year period due to the impact of unlocking, partially offset by the impact on DAC from actual versus expected market performance based on our view of bond and equity performance. Amortization of DAC for the third quarter of 2015 included a $5 million benefit from unlocking primarily driven by improved persistency that more than offset the difference between our previously assumed interest rates versus the continued low interest rate environment. Amortization of DAC for the third quarter of 2014 included a $17 million expense from unlocking primarily driven by assumed interest rates, partially offset by favorable persistency and mortality experience and a benefit from updating our variable annuity living benefit withdrawal utilization assumption. The impact on DAC from actual versus expected market performance based on our view of bond and equity performance was an expense of $23 million for the third quarter of 2015 compared to an expense of $5 million for the prior year period primarily due to more unfavorable equity market returns compared to the prior year period.ProtectionOur Protection segment offers a variety of products to address the protection and risk management needs of our retail clients including life, DI and property casualty insurance. Life and DI products are primarily provided through our advisors. Our property casualty products are sold primarily through affinity relationships. We issue insurance policies through our life insurance and property casualty subsidiaries. The primary sources of revenues for this segment are premiums, fees and charges we receive to assume insurance-related risk. We earn net investment income on owned assets supporting insurance reserves and capital supporting the business.

Other revenues for the third quarter of 2015 included a $5 million negative impact from unlocking compared to a $29 million negative impact in the prior year period. The primary driver of the unlocking impact to other revenues for both periods was lower projected gains on reinsurance contracts resulting from favorable mortality experience.74AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. ExpensesTotal expenses, which exclude the market impact on indexed universal life benefits (net of hedges and the related DAC amortization)and the DAC offset to net realized investment gains or losses, increased $74 million, or 15%, to $561 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 compared to $487 million for the prior year period primarily due to the impact of unlocking, higher life insurance claims and an increase in auto and home reserves. Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses increased $46 million, or 14%, to $384 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 compared to $338 million for the prior year period primarily due to an increase in auto and home reserves and a $14 million increase in life insurance claims, partially offset by a $13 million decrease related to a LTC future loss reserve adjustment in the third quarter of 2015. Life insurance claims were higher in the third quarter of 2015 as a result of claims from several large, later duration policies that had limited reinsurance coverage. In addition, life insurance claims experience was favorable in the prior year period. Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses related to our auto and home business increased $37 million due to an increase in the provision for estimated losses reflecting the impact of growth in exposures from a 5% increase in policies in force, higher 2015 accident year loss ratio assumptions, and approximately $10 million in expense primarily related to deterioration in auto collision experience resulting from an increase in miles driven and lower salvage values, as well as losses associated with our travel insurance business and $5 million related to prior year catastrophe reserve development associated with hail storms from last year. Catastrophe losses were $8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 compared to $14 million for the prior year period.Amortization of DAC, which excludes the DAC offset to the market impact on indexed universal life benefits and the DAC offset to net realized investment gains or losses, increased $24 million, or 92%, to $50 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 compared to $26 million for the prior year period primarily due to the impact of unlocking. Amortization of DAC for the third quarter of 2015 included a $10 million expense from unlocking primarily driven by the difference between our previously assumed interest rates versus the continued low interest rate environment. Amortization of DAC for the third quarter of 2014 included a $9 million benefit from unlocking.Corporate & OtherOur Corporate & Other segment consists of net investment income or loss on corporate level assets, including excess capital held in our subsidiaries and other unallocated equity and other revenues as well as unallocated corporate expenses. The Corporate & Other segment also includes revenues and expenses of CIEs, which are excluded on an operating basis.The following table presents the results of operations of our Corporate & Other segment on an operating basis: Three Months Ended September 30,     2015 2014 Change (in millions)  Revenues       Net investment loss$(5) $(3) $(2) (67)%Other revenues1 2 (1) (50)Total revenues(4) (1) (3) NMBanking and deposit interest expense— — — —Total net revenues(4) (1) (3) NMExpenses       Distribution expense— 1 (1) NMInterest and debt expense3 3 — —General and administrative expense35 48 (13) (27)Total expenses38 52 (14) (27)Operating loss$(42) $(53) $11 21 %NM Not Meaningful.Our Corporate & Other segment pretax operating loss excludes net realized investment gains or losses, the market impact of hedges to offset interest rate changes on unrealized gains or losses for certain investments, integration and restructuring charges, and the impact of consolidating CIEs. Our Corporate & Other segment pretax operating loss decreased $11 million, or 21%, to $42 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 compared to $53 million for the prior year period due to a $13 million decrease in general and administrative expense primarily due to lower compensation-related costs.75AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC.

The market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits (net of hedges and the related DSIC and DAC amortization) was an expense of $75 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to an expense of $60 million for the prior year period. The impact on DAC and DSIC from actual versus expected market performance based on our view of bond and equity performance was an expense of $25 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 reflecting unfavorable equity market returns compared to a benefit of $18 million for the prior year period reflecting favorable equity market returns and bond fund returns.See the table of total pretax impacts on our revenues and expenses attributable to unlocking within our Consolidated Results of Operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.76AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. Net RevenuesNet revenues decreased $112 million, or 1%, to $9.1 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to $9.2 billion for the prior year period primarily due to decreases in net investment income and other revenues, partially offset by increases in management and financial advice fees and premiums.Management and financial advice fees increased $130 million, or 3%, to $4.5 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to $4.3 billion for the prior year period primarily due to higher asset-based fees driven by an increase in average AUM. Average AUM increased $9.6 billion, or 1%, compared to the prior year period primarily due to market appreciation and wrap account net inflows, partially offset by asset management net outflows and the negative impact of foreign currency translation. See our discussion on the changes in AUM in our segment results of operations section.Net investment income decreased $104 million, or 8%, to $1.2 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to $1.3 billion for the prior year period primarily due to a $59 million decrease in investment income on fixed maturities due to low interest rates and a decrease in invested assets, a $32 million loss related to the market impact of hedges on investments and a $5 million decrease in net realized investment gains.Premiums increased $55 million, or 5%, to $1.1 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to $1.0 billion for the prior year period due to a 5% increase in auto and home policies in force.Other revenues decreased $172 million, or 15%, to $939 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to $1.1 billion for the prior year period due to a $227 million decrease in other revenues of CIEs, partially offset by the impact of unlocking and higher fees from variable annuity guarantee sales in the prior year where the fees start on the first anniversary date and higher average fee rates. Other revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 included an $8 million favorable impact from unlocking compared to a $29 million negative impact in the prior year period. The primary driver of the unlocking impact to other revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was a positive impact from model updates related to our indexed universal life product, partially offset by a negative impact from lower projected gains on reinsurance contracts resulting from favorable mortality experience. The primary driver of the unlocking impact to other revenues for the prior year period was lower projected gains on reinsurance contracts resulting from favorable mortality experience.ExpensesTotal expenses increased $181 million, or 3%, to $7.4 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to $7.2 billion for the prior year period primarily due to increases in distribution expenses and benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses.Distribution expenses increased $51 million, or 2%, to $2.5 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to $2.4 billion for the prior year period driven by higher advisor compensation due to growth in assets under management. See our discussion on the changes in AUM in our segment results of operations section.Interest credited to fixed accounts decreased $26 million, or 5%, to $503 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to $529 million for the prior year period primarily due to lower average fixed annuity account balances, partially offset by the market impact on indexed universal life benefits, net of hedges, which was an expense of $5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and a benefit of $8 million for the prior year period. Average fixed annuity account balances decreased $1.3 billion, or 10%, to $11.5 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to the prior year period due to net outflows reflecting higher lapse rates and limited new sales due to low interest rates. Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses increased $133 million, or 9%, to $1.5 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to $1.4 billion for the prior year period primarily reflecting the following items:•The nine months ended September 30, 2015 included a $58 million benefit from unlocking compared to a $6 million expense in the prior year period. The unlocking impact for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 primarily reflected an update to market-related inputs related to our living benefit valuation and a benefit from model changes that more than offset the difference between our previously assumed interest rates versus the continued low interest rate environment. The unlocking impact for the prior year period reflected assumed interest rates, partially offset by a benefit from updating our variable annuity living benefit withdrawal utilization assumption. •An $83 million increase in benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses related to our auto and home business due to an increase in the provision for estimated losses reflecting the impact of growth in exposures from a 5% increase in policies in force, higher 2015 accident year loss ratio assumptions, and approximately $10 million in expense primarily related to deterioration in auto collision experience resulting from an increase in miles driven and lower salvage values, as well as losses of $6 million associated with our travel insurance business and $8 million related to prior year catastrophe reserve development associated with hail storms from last year. Auto and home losses for the prior year period included a $30 million impact related to an increase to prior accident year loss reserves and $11 million from non-catastrophe weather-related losses in the first quarter77AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC.  of 2014. Catastrophe losses were $65 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to $56 million for the prior year period. •A $13 million increase in expense related to higher reserve funding driven by the impact of higher fees from variable annuity guarantee sales in the prior year where the fees start on the first anniversary date.•An increase in expenses compared to the prior year period due to a $48 million benefit for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 from policyholder movement of investments in Portfolio Navigator funds under certain in force variable annuities with living benefit guarantees to the Portfolio Stabilizer funds compared to a $7 million benefit for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. •A $20 million increase in life insurance claims compared to the prior year period. •A $9 million increase in expense compared to the prior year period due to the impact on DSIC from actual versus expected market performance based on our view of bond and equity performance. This impact was an expense of $5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 reflecting unfavorable equity market returns compared to a benefit of $4 million for the prior year period reflecting favorable equity market returns and bond fund returns.•An $88 million decrease in expense compared to the prior year period from the unhedged nonperformance credit spread risk adjustment on variable annuity guaranteed benefits. As the embedded derivative liability on which the nonperformance credit spread is applied increases (decreases), the impact of the nonperformance credit spread is favorable (unfavorable) to expense. The favorable impact of the nonperformance credit spread was $166 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to a favorable impact of $78 million for the prior year period.•A $101 million increase in expense from other market impacts on variable annuity guaranteed benefits, net of hedges in place to offset those risks and the related DSIC amortization. This increase was the result of an unfavorable $197 million change in the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits reserves, a favorable $99 million change in the market impact on derivatives hedging the variable annuity guaranteed benefits and an unfavorable $3 million DSIC offset. The main market drivers contributing to these changes are summarized below:•Interest rate impact on the variable annuity guaranteed living benefits liability net of the impact on the corresponding hedge assets resulted in higher expense in the 2015 period compared to the 2014 period.•Equity markets generally decreased in the 2015 period resulting in an unfavorable change in the variable annuity guaranteed living benefits liability net of the impact on the corresponding hedge assets whereas equity markets generally increased in the 2014 period resulting in a favorable change.•Other unhedged items, including the difference between the assumed and actual underlying separate account investment performance, fixed income credit exposures, transaction costs and various behavioral items, were a net unfavorable impact compared to the prior year period.Amortization of DAC increased $21 million, or 7%, to $302 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to $281 million for the prior year period. The impact on DAC from actual versus expected market performance based on our view of bond and equity performance was an expense of $20 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 reflecting unfavorable equity market returns compared to a benefit of $14 million for the prior year period reflecting favorable equity market returns and bond fund returns. Amortization of DAC for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 included a favorable impact compared to the prior year period from higher than expected persistency on variable annuity business and lower expected amortization on fixed annuities due to the decline in the size of the block.Interest and debt expense increased $34 million, or 14%, to $271 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to $237 million for the prior year period primarily due to an increase in interest and debt expense of CIEs.General and administrative expenses decreased $32 million, or 1%, to $2.3 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to $2.3 billion for the prior year period primarily due to lower compensation-related expense, an $18 million positive impact of foreign exchange and provisions for regulatory reserves in the second quarter of 2014, partially offset by a $10 million increase in expenses of CIEs.Income TaxesOur effective tax rate on income from continuing operations including income attributable to noncontrolling interests was 23.0% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to 22.2% for the prior year period. Our effective tax rate on income from continuing operations excluding income attributable to noncontrolling interests was 24.4% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to 26.9% for the prior year period. The effective tax rates for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014 were lower than the statutory rate as a result of tax preferred items including the dividends received deduction and low income housing tax credits. 78AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC.

Total segment AUM net outflows were $15.2 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Management expects, consistent with prior patterns of outflows, that outflows of primarily low margin assets directly or indirectly affiliated with Threadneedle and Columbia former parent companies will continue for the foreseeable future. The overall impact to segment results is difficult to quantify due to uncertain timing, volume and mix of the outflows. Columbia managed assets decreased $25.0 billion, or 7%, during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 primarily due to market depreciation, net outflows and retail fund distributions. Columbia retail funds decreased $21.8 billion, or 9%, during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 due to market depreciation, net outflows and retail fund distributions. Columbia retail net outflows of $7.7 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 included $1.3 billion related to a client’s decision in the third quarter to exit its portfolio due to asset allocation and $1.4 billion of outflows from a former parent affiliated distribution relationship. 83AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. Underlying Columbia retail outflows were largely driven by $6.5 billion of outflows from the Columbia Acorn Fund as well as market volatility in the third quarter that decreased investor demand, offset by normal seasonal increases in reinvested dividends in the second quarter. Columbia institutional AUM decreased $3.4 billion, or 4%, during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 due to market depreciation and other of $1.6 billion and net outflows of $1.8 billion primarily reflecting outflows from former parent affiliated distribution and former parent influenced mandates.Threadneedle managed assets decreased $8.7 billion, or 6%, during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 primarily due to a $3.6 billion negative impact of foreign currency translation, market depreciation of $1.7 billion and net outflows of $5.5 billion. Threadneedle retail funds decreased $2.0 billion, or 4%, during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 due to a $1.1 billion negative impact of foreign currency translation and market depreciation of $0.8 billion. Threadneedle institutional AUM decreased $6.7 billion, or 7%, during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 primarily due to a $2.5 billion negative impact of foreign currency translation and net outflows of $5.6 billion. Threadneedle institutional net outflows during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 included outflows of $4.3 billion from legacy insurance assets and $2.0 billion related to a client’s decision in the third quarter to exit its portfolio due to specific liquidity needs, partially offset by new third party mandates.

Net RevenuesNet revenues, which exclude net realized investment gains or losses, decreased $69 million, or 3%, to $2.4 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to $2.5 billion for the prior year period due to decreases in management and financial advice fees and net investment income.Management and financial advice fees decreased $67 million, or 3%, to $2.0 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to $2.1 billion for the prior year period primarily due to lower asset-based fees driven by a decrease in average AUM, a $45 million negative impact of foreign exchange and a $14 million benefit from a CLO liquidation in the prior year period, partially offset by an $11 million increase in performance fees. Average AUM decreased $5.3 billion, or 1%, compared to the prior year period primarily due to net outflows and the negative impact of foreign currency translation, partially offset by market appreciation.Net investment income decreased $13 million, or 54%, to $11 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to $24 million for the prior year period primarily due to a $9 million benefit from a CLO liquidation in the prior year period.84AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. ExpensesTotal expenses decreased $47 million, or 2%, to $1.9 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to $1.9 billion for the prior year period due to a $37 million decrease in distribution expenses from lower retail fund assets and a $10 million decrease in general and administrative expense primarily due to an $18 million benefit from the impact of foreign exchange, partially offset by an $11 million increase in compensation related to higher performance fees. AnnuitiesThe following table presents the results of operations of our Annuities segment on an operating basis: Nine Months Ended September 30,     2015 2014 Change (in millions)  Revenues       Management and financial advice fees$569 $563 $6 1 %Distribution fees274 270 4 1Net investment income647 711 (64) (9)Premiums77 84 (7) (8)Other revenues347 314 33 11Total revenues1,914 1,942 (28) (1)Banking and deposit interest expense— — — —Total net revenues1,914 1,942 (28) (1)Expenses       Distribution expenses335 326 9 3Interest credited to fixed accounts377 423 (46) (11)Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses339 335 4 1Amortization of deferred acquisition costs168 183 (15) (8)Interest and debt expense29 28 1 4General and administrative expense168 173 (5) (3)Total expenses1,416 1,468 (52) (4)Operating earnings$498 $474 $24 5 %Our Annuities segment pretax operating income, which excludes net realized investment gains or losses (net of the related DSIC and DAC amortization) and the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits (net of hedges and the related DSIC and DAC amortization), increased $24 million, or 5%, to $498 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to $474 million for the prior year period primarily due to the impact of unlocking, partially offset by the impact on DAC and DSIC from actual versus expected market performance, the negative impact from lower invested assets due to fixed annuity net outflows and a $42 million benefit in the prior year period from policyholder movement of investments in Portfolio Navigator funds under certain in force variable annuities with living benefit guarantees to the Portfolio Stabilizer funds compared to a $6 million benefit in the current period. The impact of unlocking was an increase to pretax operating income of $66 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to a decrease of $22 million for the prior year period. The impact on DAC and DSIC from actual versus expected market performance based on our view of bond and equity performance was an expense of $24 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to a benefit of $17 million for the prior year period primarily due to more unfavorable equity market returns compared to the prior year period.RiverSource variable annuity account balances decreased 4% to $72.8 billion at September 30, 2015 compared to the prior year period due to net outflows of $1.4 billion and market depreciation. RiverSource fixed annuity account balances declined 12% to $10.9 billion at September 30, 2015 compared to the prior year period reflecting limited new sales from low interest rates and higher lapse rates related to the re-pricing of the five-year guarantee block during 2014, a portion of which came out of its surrender charge period earlier in 2015. The change in crediting rates decreased the level of spread compression in both periods. 85AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. Net RevenuesNet revenues, which exclude net realized investment gains or losses, decreased $28 million, or 1%, to $1.9 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to $1.9 billion for the prior year period primarily due to lower net investment income, partially offset by an increase in other revenues.Net investment income, which excludes net realized investment gains or losses, decreased $64 million, or 9%, to $647 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to $711 million for the prior year period primarily reflecting lower invested assets due to fixed annuity net outflows.Other revenues increased $33 million, or 11%, to $347 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to $314 million for the prior year period due to higher fees from variable annuity guarantee sales in the prior year where the fees start on the first anniversary date and higher average fee rates.ExpensesTotal expenses, which exclude the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits (net of hedges and the related DSIC and DAC amortization) and the DAC and DSIC offset to net realized investment gains or losses, decreased $52 million, or 4%, to $1.4 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to $1.5 billion for the prior year period primarily due to the impact of unlocking and a decrease in interested credited to fixed accounts, partially offset by the impact on DAC and DSIC from actual versus expected market performance. Interest credited to fixed accounts decreased $46 million, or 11%, to $377 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to $423 million for the prior year period due to lower average fixed annuity account balances. Average fixed annuity account balances decreased $1.3 billion, or 10%, to $11.5 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to the prior year period due to net outflows reflecting higher lapse rates and limited new sales due to low interest rates. Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses, which exclude the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits (net of hedges and the related DSIC amortization) and the DSIC offset to net realized investment gains or losses, increased $4 million, or 1%, to $339 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to $335 million for the prior year period primarily reflecting the following items: •Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 included a $61 million benefit from unlocking primarily reflecting an update to market-related inputs related to our living benefit valuation and a benefit from model changes that more than offset the difference between our previously assumed interest rates versus the continued low interest rate environment. Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses for the prior year period included a $5 million expense from unlocking primarily reflecting assumed interest rates, partially offset by a benefit from updating our variable annuity living benefit withdrawal utilization assumption.•An increase in expenses compared to the prior year period due to a $50 million benefit for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 from policyholder movement of investments in Portfolio Navigator funds under certain in force variable annuities with living benefit guarantees to the Portfolio Stabilizer funds compared to a $7 million benefit for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.•A $13 million increase in expense related to higher reserve funding driven by the impact of higher fees from variable annuity guarantee sales in the prior year where the fees start on the first anniversary date.•A $9 million increase in expense compared to the prior year period due to the impact on DSIC from actual versus expected market performance based on our view of bond and equity performance. This impact was an expense of $5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 reflecting unfavorable equity market returns compared to a benefit of $4 million for the prior year period reflecting favorable equity market returns and bond fund returns.Amortization of DAC, which excludes the DAC offset to the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits and the DAC offset to net realized investment gains or losses, decreased $15 million, or 8%, to $168 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to $183 million for the prior year period. Amortization of DAC for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 included a $5 million benefit from unlocking primarily driven by improved persistency that more than offset the difference between our previously assumed interest rates versus the continued low interest rate environment. Amortization of DAC for the prior year period included a $17 million expense from unlocking primarily driven by assumed interest rates, partially offset by favorable persistency and mortality experience and a benefit from updating our variable annuity living benefit withdrawal utilization assumption. The impact on DAC from actual versus expected market performance based on our view of bond and equity performance was an expense of $19 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 reflecting unfavorable equity market returns compared to a benefit of $13 million for the prior year period reflecting favorable equity market returns and bond fund returns. Amortization of DAC for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 included a favorable impact compared to the prior year period from higher than expected persistency on variable annuity business and lower expected amortization on fixed annuities due to the decline in the size of the block.86AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC.

Based on this information, along with a review of the discount rate, management’s best estimate for LTC claims reserves resulted in a net $32 million increase during the first quarter of 2015. The most significant drivers of the reserve increase were updates to the benefit utilization rates and claims termination rates, partially offset by a $15 million benefit from a higher discount rate. During the second quarter of 2015, we completed our review which resulted in a favorable reserve release. Based on the analysis, we concluded that the actual claims utilization and termination experience was more favorable than the initial assumptions provided by the reinsurer, and as a result, released $18 million of the net $32 million reserve. We also increased the discount rate for our disability income (“DI”) reserve for unpaid amounts on reported claims, which resulted in a $7 million reserve decrease in the first quarter of 2015. The current discount rates are based on the average interest rates earned on assets supporting the liability and were 6.25% and 5.0% for LTC and DI, respectively, at September 30, 2015.Net RevenuesNet revenues, which exclude net realized investment gains or losses (net of unearned revenue amortization and the reinsurance accrual) and the unearned revenue amortization and the reinsurance accrual offset to the market impact on indexed universal life benefits, increased $89 million, or 5%, to $1.8 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to $1.7 billion for the prior year period primarily due to the impact of unlocking and growth in auto and home premiums, partially offset by a $13 million unfavorable impact related to a reinsurance premium correction in the third quarter of 2015.Premiums increased $61 million, or 6%, to $1.0 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to $954 million for the prior year period due to a 5% increase in auto and home policies in force, partially offset by a $4 million unfavorable impact related to a reinsurance premium correction in the third quarter of 2015.87AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. Other revenues, which exclude the unearned revenue amortization and the reinsurance accrual offset to the market impact on indexed universal life benefits and the unearned revenue amortization and the reinsurance accrual offset to net realized investment gains or losses, increased $10 million, or 3%, to $298 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to $288 million for the prior year period due to the impact of unlocking, partially offset by a $9 million unfavorable impact related to a reinsurance premium correction in the third quarter of 2015. Other revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 included a $5 million negative impact from unlocking compared to a $29 million negative impact in the prior year period. The primary driver of the unlocking impact to other revenues for both periods was lower projected gains on reinsurance contracts resulting from favorable mortality experience.ExpensesTotal expenses, which exclude the market impact on indexed universal life benefits (net of hedges and the related DAC amortization) and the DAC offset to net realized investment gains or losses, increased $157 million, or 11%, to $1.6 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to $1.5 billion for the prior year period primarily due to increases in benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses and amortization of DAC. Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses increased $116 million, or 11%, to $1.1 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to $1.0 billion for the prior year period primarily due to an increase in auto and home reserves, a $20 million increase in life insurance claims, and a net $14 million LTC reserve increase in the first half of 2015, partially offset by a $7 million favorable impact from a change in the discount rate for DI insurance products and a $13 million decrease related to a LTC future loss reserve adjustment in the third quarter of 2015. Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses related to our auto and home business increased $83 million due to an increase in the provision for estimated losses reflecting the impact of growth in exposures from a 5% increase in policies in force, higher 2015 accident year loss ratio assumptions, and approximately $10 million in expense primarily related to deterioration in auto collision experience resulting from an increase in miles driven and lower salvage values, as well as losses of $6 million associated with our travel insurance business and a $8 million related to prior year catastrophe reserve development associated with hail storms from last year. Auto and home losses for the prior year period included a $30 million impact related to an increase to prior accident year loss reserves and $11 million from non-catastrophe weather-related losses in the first quarter of 2014. Catastrophe losses were $65 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to $56 million for the prior year period. Amortization of DAC, which excludes the DAC offset to the market impact on indexed universal life benefits and the DAC offset to net realized investment gains or losses, increased $31 million, or 34%, to $121 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to $90 million for the prior year period primarily due to the impact of unlocking. Amortization of DAC for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 included a $10 million expense from unlocking primarily driven by the difference between our previously assumed interest rates versus the continued low interest rate environment. Amortization of DAC for the prior year period included a $9 million benefit from unlocking. Corporate & OtherThe following table presents the results of operations of our Corporate & Other segment on an operating basis: Nine Months Ended September 30,     2015 2014 Change (in millions)  Revenues       Distribution fees$— $1 $(1) NMNet investment income (loss)(22) (4) (18) NMOther revenues10 6 4 67 %Total revenues(12) 3 (15) NMBanking and deposit interest expense— — — —Total net revenues(12) 3 (15) NMExpenses       Distribution expenses— 1 (1) NMInterest and debt expense12 16 (4) (25)General and administrative expense137 169 (32) (19)Total expenses149 186 (37) (20)Operating loss$(161) $(183) $22 12 %NM Not Meaningful.Our Corporate & Other segment pretax operating loss excludes net realized investment gains or losses, the market impact of hedges to offset interest rate changes on unrealized gains or losses for certain investments, integration and restructuring charges, and the impact 88AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. of consolidating CIEs. Our Corporate & Other segment pretax operating loss decreased $22 million, or 12%, to $161 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to $183 million for the prior year period due to a decrease in expenses, partially offset by a decrease in net revenues. Net revenues decreased $15 million compared to the prior year period reflecting higher net investment losses due to an increase in losses associated with affordable housing partnerships, partially offset by a $7 million gain on the sale of a building in the second quarter of 2015. Expenses decreased $37 million compared to the prior year period reflecting lower compensation-related expenses, as well as higher expenses in the prior year period related to the early redemption of our senior notes due 2039 and a provision for potential resolution of a regulatory matter. Market RiskOur primary market risk exposures are interest rate, equity price, foreign currency exchange rate and credit risk. Equity price and interest rate fluctuations can have a significant impact on our results of operations, primarily due to the effects they have on the asset management and other asset-based fees we earn, the spread income generated on our fixed annuities, fixed insurance, brokerage client cash balances, face-amount certificate products and the fixed portion of our variable annuities and variable insurance contracts, the value of DAC and DSIC assets, the value of liabilities for guaranteed benefits associated with our variable annuities and the value of derivatives held to hedge these benefits.Our earnings from fixed annuities, fixed insurance, and the fixed portion of variable annuities and variable insurance contracts are based upon the spread between rates earned on assets held and the rates at which interest is credited to accounts. We primarily invest in fixed rate securities to fund the rate credited to clients. We guarantee an interest rate to the holders of these products. Investment assets and client liabilities generally differ as it relates to basis, repricing or maturity characteristics. Rates credited to clients’ accounts generally reset at shorter intervals than the yield on the underlying investments. Therefore, in an increasing interest rate environment, higher interest rates may be reflected in crediting rates to clients sooner than in rates earned on invested assets, which could result in a reduced spread between the two rates, reduced earned income and a negative impact on pretax income. However, the current low interest rate environment is resulting in interest rates below the level of some of our liability guaranteed minimum interest rates (“GMIRs”). Hence, a modest rise in interest rates would not necessarily result in changes to all the liability credited rates while projected asset purchases would capture the full increase in interest rates. This dynamic would result in widening spreads under a modestly rising rate scenario given the current relationship between the current level of interest rates and the underlying GMIRs on the business. As a result of the low interest rate environment, our current reinvestment yields are generally lower than the current portfolio yield. We expect our portfolio income yields to continue to decline in future periods if interest rates remain low. The carrying value and weighted average yield of non-structured fixed maturity securities and commercial mortgage loans that may generate proceeds to reinvest through September 30, 2017 due to prepayment, maturity or call activity at the option of the issuer, excluding securities with a make-whole provision, were $3.6 billion and 3.7%, respectively, as of September 30, 2015. In addition, residential mortgage-backed securities, which are subject to prepayment risk as a result of the low interest rate environment, totaled $6.0 billion and had a weighted average yield of 2.7% as of September 30, 2015. While these amounts represent investments that could be subject to reinvestment risk, it is also possible that these investments will be used to fund liabilities or may not be prepaid and will remain invested at their current yields. In addition to the interest rate environment, the mix of benefit payments versus product sales as well as the timing and volumes associated with such mix may impact our investment yield. Furthermore, reinvestment activities and the associated investment yield may also be impacted by corporate strategies implemented at management’s discretion. The average yield for investment purchases during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was approximately 3.1%.The reinvestment of proceeds from maturities, calls and prepayments at rates below the current portfolio yield, which may be below the level of some liability guaranteed minimum interest rates, will have a negative impact to future operating results. To mitigate the unfavorable impact that the low interest rate environment has on our spread income, we assess reinvestment risk in our investment portfolio and monitor this risk in accordance with our asset/liability management framework. In addition, we may reduce the crediting rates on our fixed products when warranted, subject to guaranteed minimums. In 2014, we set lower renewal interest rates for a portion of our fixed annuities that were above the guaranteed minimum interest rates, which helped relieve some of the spread compression caused by low rates.89AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. The following table presents the account values of fixed annuities, fixed insurance, and the fixed portion of variable annuities and variable insurance contracts by range of guaranteed minimum crediting rates and the range of the difference between rates credited to policyholders and contractholders as of September 30, 2015 and the respective guaranteed minimums, as well as the percentage of account values subject to rate reset in the time period indicated. Rates are reset at our discretion, subject to guaranteed minimums.

Each of these guaranteed benefits guarantees payouts to the annuity holder under certain specific conditions regardless of the performance of the underlying invested assets.The variable annuity guarantees continue to be managed by utilizing a hedging program which attempts to match the sensitivity of the assets with the sensitivity of the liabilities. This approach works with the premise that matched sensitivities will produce a highly effective hedging result. Our comprehensive hedging program focuses mainly on first order sensitivities of assets and liabilities: Equity Market Level (Delta), Interest Rate Level (Rho) and Volatility (Vega). Additionally, various second order sensitivities are managed. We use various index options across the term structure, interest rate swaps and swaptions, total return swaps and futures to manage the risk exposures. The exposures are measured and monitored daily, and adjustments to the hedge portfolio are made as necessary.We have a macro hedge program to provide protection against the statutory tail scenario risk arising from variable annuity reserves on our statutory surplus and to cover some of the residual risks not covered by other hedging activities. We assess the residual risk under a range of scenarios in creating and executing the macro hedge program. As a means of economically hedging these risks, we use a combination of options and/or swaps. Certain of the macro hedge derivatives used contain settlement provisions linked to both equity returns and interest rates; the remaining are interest rate contracts or equity contracts. The macro hedge program could result in additional earnings volatility as changes in the value of the macro hedge derivatives, which are designed to reduce statutory capital volatility, may not be closely aligned to changes in the variable annuity guarantee embedded derivatives.To evaluate interest rate and equity price risk we perform sensitivity testing which measures the impact on pretax income from the sources listed below for a 12-month period following a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates or a hypothetical 10% decline in equity prices. The interest rate risk test assumes a sudden 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve, with rates then staying at those levels for the next 12 months. The equity price risk test assumes a sudden 10% drop in equity prices, with equity prices then staying at those levels for the next 12 months. In estimating the values of variable annuity riders, equity indexed annuities, stock market certificates, indexed universal life insurance and the associated hedge assets, we assume no change in implied market volatility despite the 10% drop in equity prices.90AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. The following tables present our estimate of the impact on pretax income from the above defined hypothetical market movements as of September 30, 2015:  Equity Price Exposure to Pretax IncomeEquity Price Decline 10% BeforeHedge Impact Hedge Impact Net Impact  (in millions)Asset-based management and distribution fees (1) $(226) $4 $(222)DAC and DSIC amortization (2) (3) (106) — (106)Variable annuity riders:      GMDB and GMIB (3) (142) — (142)GMWB (425) 435 10GMAB (50) 49 (1)DAC and DSIC amortization (4) N/A N/A (1)Total variable annuity riders (617) 484 (134)Macro hedge program (5) — 17 17Equity indexed annuities 1 (1) —Certificates 1 (1) —Indexed universal life insurance 9 (8) 1Total $(938) $495 $(444)  Interest Rate Exposure to Pretax IncomeInterest Rate Increase 100 Basis Points Before Hedge Impact Hedge Impact Net Impact  (in millions)Asset-based management and distribution fees (1) $(48) $— $(48)Variable annuity riders:      GMDB and GMIB — — —GMWB 971 (1,096) (125)GMAB 38 (41) (3)DAC and DSIC amortization (4) N/A N/A 22Total variable annuity riders 1,009 (1,137) (106)Macro hedge program (5) — 23 23Fixed annuities, fixed insurance and fixed portion of variable annuities and variable insurance products 66 — 66Brokerage client cash balances 142 — 142Certificates 4 — 4Indexed universal life insurance 44 1 45Total $1,217 $(1,113) $126N/A Not Applicable.(1) Excludes incentive income which is impacted by market and fund performance during the period and cannot be readily estimated.(2) Market impact on DAC and DSIC amortization resulting from lower projected profits.(3) In estimating the impact on DAC and DSIC amortization resulting from lower projected profits, we have not changed our assumed equity asset growth rates. This is a significantly more conservative estimate than if we assumed management follows its mean reversion guideline and increased near-term rates to recover the drop in equity values over a five-year period. We make this same conservative assumption in estimating the impact from GMDB and GMIB riders.(4) Market impact on DAC and DSIC amortization related to variable annuity riders is modeled net of hedge impact.(5) The market impact of the macro hedge program is modeled net of any related impact to DAC and DSIC amortization.The above results compare to an estimated negative net impact to pretax income of $435 million related to a 10% equity price decline and an estimated positive net impact to pretax income of $89 million related to a 100 basis point increase in interest rates as of December 31, 2014. The change in interest rate exposure since December 31, 2014 is primarily the result of adding new interest rate derivatives to the macro hedge program during 2015 and subsequent changes in market rates. 91AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. Net impacts shown in the above table from GMWB and GMAB riders result largely from differences between the liability valuation basis and the hedging basis. Liabilities are valued using fair value accounting principles, with risk margins incorporated in contractholder behavior assumptions and with discount rates increased to reflect a current market estimate of our risk of nonperformance specific to these liabilities. The nonperformance spread risk is not hedged.Actual results could differ materially from those illustrated above as they are based on a number of estimates and assumptions. These include assuming that implied market volatility does not change when equity prices fall by 10%, that management does not increase assumed equity asset growth rates to anticipate recovery of the drop in equity values when valuing DAC, DSIC and GMDB and GMIB liability values and that the 100 basis point increase in interest rates is a parallel shift of the yield curve. Furthermore, we have not tried to anticipate changes in client preferences for different types of assets or other changes in client behavior, nor have we tried to anticipate actions management might take to increase revenues or reduce expenses in these scenarios.The selection of a 100 basis point interest rate increase as well as a 10% equity price decline should not be construed as a prediction of future market events. Impacts of larger or smaller changes in interest rates or equity prices may not be proportional to those shown for a 100 basis point increase in interest rates or a 10% decline in equity prices.Fair Value MeasurementsWe report certain assets and liabilities at fair value; specifically, separate account assets, derivatives, embedded derivatives, properties held by our consolidated property funds, and most investments and cash equivalents. Fair value assumes the exchange of assets or liabilities occurs in orderly transactions and is not the result of a forced liquidation or distressed sale. We include actual market prices, or observable inputs, in our fair value measurements to the extent available. Broker quotes are obtained when quotes from pricing services are not available. We validate prices obtained from third parties through a variety of means such as: price variance analysis, subsequent sales testing, stale price review, price comparison across pricing vendors and due diligence reviews of vendors. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our fair value measurements.Fair Value of Liabilities and Nonperformance RiskCompanies are required to measure the fair value of liabilities at the price that would be received to transfer the liability to a market participant (an exit price). Since there is not a market for the obligations of our variable annuity riders and indexed universal life insurance, we consider the assumptions participants in a hypothetical market would make to reflect an exit price. As a result, we adjust the valuation of variable annuity riders and indexed universal life insurance by updating certain contractholder assumptions, adding explicit margins to provide for profit, risk and expenses, and adjusting the rates used to discount expected cash flows to reflect a current market estimate of our nonperformance risk. The nonperformance risk adjustment is based on observable market data adjusted to estimate the risk of our life insurance company subsidiaries not fulfilling these liabilities. Consistent with general market conditions, this estimate resulted in a spread over the LIBOR swap curve as of September 30, 2015. As our estimate of this spread widens or tightens, the liability will decrease or increase. If this nonperformance credit spread moves to a zero spread over the LIBOR swap curve, the reduction to net income would be approximately $264 million, net of DAC, DSIC, unearned revenue amortization, the reinsurance accrual and income taxes (calculated at the statutory tax rate of 35%), based on September 30, 2015 credit spreads. Liquidity and Capital ResourcesOverviewWe maintained substantial liquidity during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. At September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, we had $2.8 billion and $2.6 billion, respectively, in cash and cash equivalents. We have additional liquidity available through an unsecured revolving credit facility for up to $500 million. Under the terms of the underlying credit agreement, we can increase this facility to $750 million upon satisfaction of certain approval requirements. Available borrowings under this facility are reduced by any outstanding letters of credit. At September 30, 2015, we had no outstanding borrowings under this credit facility and had $1 million of outstanding letters of credit. On May 1, 2015, we amended the underlying credit agreement for the facility to extend the expiration to May 2020. Our junior subordinated notes due 2066 and the revolving credit facility contain various administrative, reporting, legal and financial covenants. We were in compliance with all such covenants at September 30, 2015. We intend to use cash on hand to fund the repayment of $350 million of our senior notes due in November 2015. In August 2015, we extinguished $41 million of our junior subordinated notes due 2066 in open market transactions and recognized a gain of less than $1 million.We enter into short-term borrowings, which may include repurchase agreements and Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) advances, to reduce reinvestment risk from higher levels of expected annuity net cash flows. Short-term borrowings allow us to receive cash to reinvest in longer-duration assets, while paying back the short-term debt with cash flows generated by the fixed income portfolio. The balance of repurchase agreements at both September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014 was $50 million, which is collateralized with agency residential mortgage backed securities and commercial mortgage backed securities from our investment portfolio. Our subsidiary, RiverSource Life Insurance Company (“RiverSource Life”), is a member of the FHLB of Des Moines, which provides access to collateralized borrowings. As of both September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, we had $150 million of borrowings from 92AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. the FHLB, which is collateralized with commercial mortgage backed securities. We believe cash flows from operating activities, available cash balances and our availability of revolver borrowings will be sufficient to fund our operating liquidity needs.Dividends from SubsidiariesAmeriprise Financial is primarily a parent holding company for the operations carried out by our wholly owned subsidiaries. Because of our holding company structure, our ability to meet our cash requirements, including the payment of dividends on our common stock, substantially depends upon the receipt of dividends or return of capital from our subsidiaries, particularly our life insurance subsidiary, RiverSource Life, our face-amount certificate subsidiary, Ameriprise Certificate Company (“ACC”), AMPF Holding Corporation, which is the parent company of our retail introducing broker-dealer subsidiary, Ameriprise Financial Services, Inc. (“AFSI”) and our clearing broker-dealer subsidiary, American Enterprise Investment Services, Inc. (“AEIS”), our Auto and Home insurance subsidiary, IDS Property Casualty Insurance Company (“IDS Property Casualty”), doing business as Ameriprise Auto & Home Insurance, our transfer agent subsidiary, Columbia Management Investment Services Corp., our investment advisory company, Columbia Management Investment Advisers, LLC, and Threadneedle. The payment of dividends by many of our subsidiaries is restricted and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to regulatory capital requirements.Actual capital and regulatory capital requirements for our wholly owned subsidiaries subject to regulatory capital requirements were as follows: Actual Capital Regulatory Capital Requirements September 30, 2015 December 31, 2014 September 30, 2015 December 31, 2014 (in millions)RiverSource Life(1)(2)$3,839 $3,614 N/A $595RiverSource Life of NY(1)(2)338 312 N/A 59IDS Property Casualty(1)(3)725 560 $211 200Ameriprise Insurance Company(1)(3)46 45 2 2ACC(4)(5)258 248 241 226Threadneedle(6)306 221 168 199Ameriprise National Trust Bank(7)34 21 10 10AFSI(3)(4)137 93 # #Ameriprise Captive Insurance Company(3)67 61 11 10Ameriprise Trust Company(3)27 26 21 24AEIS(3)(4)110 117 54 49RiverSource Distributors, Inc.(3)(4)14 13 # #Columbia Management Investment Distributors, Inc.(3)(4)19 18 # #N/A Not applicable.# Amounts are less than $1 million.(1) Actual capital is determined on a statutory basis.(2) Regulatory capital requirement is based on the statutory risk-based capital filing.(3) Regulatory capital requirement is based on the applicable regulatory requirement, calculated as of September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014.(4) Actual capital is determined on an adjusted GAAP basis.(5) ACC is required to hold capital in compliance with the Minnesota Department of Commerce and SEC capital requirements.(6) Actual capital and regulatory capital requirements are determined in accordance with U.K. regulatory legislation. The regulatory capital requirements at September 30, 2015 represent calculations at December 31, 2014 of the rule based requirements, as specified by FCA regulations.(7) Ameriprise National Trust Bank is required to maintain capital in compliance with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency regulations and policies.In addition to the particular regulations restricting dividend payments and establishing subsidiary capitalization requirements, we take into account the overall health of the business, capital levels and risk management considerations in determining a dividend strategy for payments to our company from our subsidiaries, and in deciding to use cash to make capital contributions to our subsidiaries.During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the parent holding company received cash dividends or a return of capital from its subsidiaries of $1.3 billion (including $675 million from RiverSource Life) and contributed cash to its subsidiaries of $243 million (including $175 million to IDS Property Casualty). During the nine months ended September 30, 2014, the parent holding company received cash dividends or a return of capital from its subsidiaries of $1.2 billion (including $500 million from RiverSource Life) and contributed cash to its subsidiaries of $17 million.93AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. Dividends Paid to Shareholders and Share Repurchases We paid regular quarterly dividends to our shareholders totaling $355 million and $326 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively. On October 21, 2015, we announced a quarterly dividend of $0.67 per common share. The dividend will be paid on November 13, 2015 to our shareholders of record at the close of business on November 2, 2015.In April 2014, our Board of Directors authorized an expenditure of up to $2.5 billion for the repurchase of shares of our common stock through April 28, 2016. As of September 30, 2015, the Company had $553 million remaining under its share repurchase authorization. We intend to fund share repurchases through existing working capital, future earnings and other customary financing methods. The share repurchase programs do not require the purchase of any minimum number of shares, and depending on market conditions and other factors, these purchases may be commenced or suspended at any time without prior notice. Acquisitions under the share repurchase programs may be made in the open market, through privately negotiated transactions or block trades or other means. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we repurchased a total of 9.8 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $124.64 per share.Cash FlowsCash flows of CIEs are reflected in our cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities, investing activities and financing activities. Cash held by CIEs is not available for general use by Ameriprise Financial, nor is Ameriprise Financial cash available for general use by its CIEs. As such, the operating, investing and financing cash flows of the CIEs have no impact to the change in cash and cash equivalents.Operating ActivitiesNet cash provided by operating activities decreased $78 million to $1.9 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to $2.0 billion for the prior year period primarily due to changes in cash held by CIEs, a $303 million decrease in cash related to changes in investment properties of CIEs primarily reflecting higher purchases of investment properties and a $151 million decrease in cash related to changes in brokerage deposits, partially offset by a $213 million increase in cash from changes in other investments primarily related to trading securities, a $150 million decrease in cash outflows related to derivatives and receivables and a $100 million reduction of income taxes paid, net compared to the prior year period.Investing ActivitiesOur investing activities primarily relate to our Available-for-Sale investment portfolio. Further, this activity is significantly affected by the net flows of our investment certificate, fixed annuity and universal life products reflected in financing activities.Net cash used in investing activities increased $275 million to $447 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to $172 million for the prior year period primarily reflecting a $827 million increase in purchases of Available-for Sale securities, partially offset by a $313 million increase in proceeds from sales and maturities, sinking fund payments and calls of Available-for-Sale securities. Net cash outflows related to purchases and sales of investments by consolidated investment entities decreased $91 million and net cash outflows related to purchases and sales of other investments decreased $130 million.Financing ActivitiesNet cash used in financing activities decreased $256 million to $1.3 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to $1.6 billion for the prior year period. Cash outflows related to repayments of debt of CIEs decreased $513 million compared to the prior year period. Net cash outflows related to noncontrolling interests decreased $218 million compared to the prior period due to higher investments from noncontrolling interests and lower distributions to noncontrolling interests. Cash outflows related to the repurchase of debt decreased $159 million compared to the prior year period. Net cash outflows from policyholder account balances increased $259 million compared to the prior year period primarily due to higher surrenders and other benefits reflecting higher lapse rates. Cash outflows related to the repurchase of common shares increased $102 million compared to the prior year period. Cash flows for the prior year period reflected a $543 million increase in cash from issuance of our unsecured senior notes due October 2024 and a $301 million decrease in cash related to short-term borrowings as we reduced our borrowings from the FHLB. Contractual CommitmentsThere have been no material changes to our contractual obligations disclosed in our 2014 10-K. Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe provide asset management services to investment entities which are considered to be VIEs, such as CLOs, hedge funds, property funds and private equity funds, which are sponsored by us. We consolidate certain CLOs and property funds. We have determined that consolidation is not required for hedge funds and private equity funds which are sponsored by us. Our maximum exposure to loss with respect to our investment in these non-consolidated entities is limited to our carrying value. We have no obligation to provide further financial or other support to these investment entities nor have we provided any support to these investment entities.
