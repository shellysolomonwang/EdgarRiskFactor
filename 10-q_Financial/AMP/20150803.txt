Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2014 10-K, “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2015 filed with the SEC on May 4, 2015 and other factors as discussed herein.Equity price, credit market and interest rate fluctuations can have a significant impact on our results of operations, primarily due to the effects they have on the asset management and other asset-based fees we earn, the “spread” income generated on our fixed annuities, fixed insurance, deposit products and the fixed portion of variable annuities and variable insurance contracts, the value of deferred acquisition costs (“DAC”) and deferred sales inducement costs (“DSIC”) assets, the values of liabilities for guaranteed benefits associated with our variable annuities and the values of derivatives held to hedge these benefits.Earnings, as well as operating earnings, will continue to be negatively impacted by the ongoing low interest rate environment. In addition to continuing spread compression in our interest sensitive product lines, a sustained low interest rate environment may result in increases to our reserves and changes in various rate assumptions we use to amortize DAC and DSIC, which may negatively impact our operating earnings. For additional discussion on our interest rate risk, see Item 3. “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.”We consolidate certain collateralized loan obligations (“CLOs”) and property funds (pooled investment vehicles) for which we provide asset management services. These entities are defined as consolidated investment entities (“CIEs”). While the consolidation of the CIEs impacts our balance sheet and income statement, our exposure to these entities is unchanged and there is no impact to the underlying business results. For further information on CIEs, see Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Changes in the valuation of the CIE assets and liabilities impact pretax income. The net income (loss) of the CIEs is reflected in net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests. The results of operations of the CIEs are reflected in the Corporate & Other segment. On a consolidated basis, the management fees we earn for the services we provide to the CIEs and the related general and administrative expenses are eliminated and the changes in the assets and liabilities related to the CIEs, primarily syndicated loans and debt, are reflected in net investment income. We continue to include the fees from these entities in the management and financial advice fees line within our Asset Management segment.While our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), management believes that operating measures, which exclude net realized investment gains or losses; the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits, net of hedges and the related DSIC and DAC amortization; the market impact on indexed universal life benefits, net of hedges and the related DAC amortization, unearned revenue amortization and the reinsurance accrual; the market impact of hedges to offset interest rate changes on unrealized gains or losses for certain investments; integration and restructuring charges; income (loss) from discontinued operations; and the impact of consolidating CIEs, best reflect the underlying performance of our core operations and facilitate a more meaningful trend analysis. Management uses certain of these non-GAAP measures to evaluate our financial performance on a basis comparable to that used by some securities analysts and investors. Also, certain of these non-GAAP measures are taken into consideration, to varying degrees, for purposes of business planning and analysis and for certain compensation-related matters. Throughout our Management’s Discussion and Analysis, these non-GAAP measures are referred to as operating measures.It is management’s priority to increase shareholder value over a multi-year horizon by achieving our on-average, over-time financial targets.54AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. Our financial targets are:•Operating total net revenue growth of 6% to 8%,•Operating earnings per diluted share growth of 12% to 15%, and•Operating return on equity excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) of 19% to 23%.The following tables reconcile our GAAP measures to operating measures: Three Months Ended  June 30, Six Months Ended  June 30, 2015 2014 2015 2014 (in millions)Total net revenues$3,128 $3,072 $6,181 $6,068Less: Revenue attributable to CIEs141 160 290 337Less: Net realized gains5 1 15 6Less: Market impact on indexed universal life benefits— (4) (4) (2)Less: Market impact of hedges on investments(1) — (1) —Operating total net revenues$2,983 $2,915 $5,881 $5,727     Per Diluted Share Three Months Ended  June 30, Three Months Ended  June 30, 2015 2014 2015 2014 (in millions, except per share amounts)Net income$476 $467    Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests61 93    Net income attributable to Ameriprise Financial415 374 $2.23 $1.91Less: Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax— — — —Net income from continuing operations attributable to Ameriprise Financial415 374 2.23 1.91Add: Integration/restructuring charges, net of tax (1)1 — 0.01 —Add: Market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits, net of tax (1)23 35 0.12 0.18Add: Market impact on indexed universal life benefits, net of tax (1)(3) — (0.02) —Add: Market impact of hedges on investments, net of tax (1)1 — 0.01 —Less: Net realized gains, net of tax (1)3 1 0.02 0.01Operating earnings$434 $408 $2.33 $2.08        Weighted average common shares outstanding:       Basic183.8 192.7    Diluted186.4 196.2    (1) Calculated using the statutory tax rate of 35%.55AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC.

Critical Accounting PoliciesThe accounting and reporting policies that we use affect our Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of our accounting and reporting policies are critical to an understanding of our consolidated results of operations and financial condition. In some cases, the application of these policies can be significantly affected by the estimates, judgments and assumptions made by management during the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements. These accounting policies are discussed in detail in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis — Critical Accounting Policies” in our 2014 10-K.Recent Accounting PronouncementsFor information regarding recent accounting pronouncements and their expected impact on our future consolidated results of operations and financial condition, see Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Assets Under Management and AdministrationAssets under management (“AUM”) include external client assets for which we provide investment management services, such as the assets of the Columbia funds and Threadneedle funds, assets of institutional clients and assets of clients in our advisor platform held in wrap accounts as well as assets managed by sub-advisers selected by us. AUM also includes certain assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets for which we provide investment management services and recognize management fees in our Asset Management segment, such as the assets of the general account and the variable product funds held in the separate accounts of our life insurance subsidiaries and CIEs. These assets do not include assets under advisement, for which we provide model portfolios but do not have full discretionary investment authority. Corporate & Other AUM primarily includes former bank assets that are managed within our Corporate & Other segment.Assets under administration (“AUA”) include assets for which we provide administrative services such as client assets invested in other companies’ products that we offer outside of our wrap accounts. These assets include those held in clients’ brokerage accounts. We generally record revenues received from administered assets as distribution fees. We do not exercise management discretion over these assets and do not earn a management fee. These assets are not reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. AUA also includes certain assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets for which we do not provide investment management services and do not recognize management fees, such as investments in non-affiliated funds held in the separate accounts of our life insurance subsidiaries. These assets do not include assets under advisement, for which we provide model portfolios but do not have full discretionary investment authority.The following table presents detail regarding our AUM and AUA: June 30,   2015 2014 Change (in billions)  Assets Under Management and Administration       Advice & Wealth Management AUM$181.1 $167.3 $13.8 8 %Asset Management AUM503.1 518.3 (15.2) (3)Corporate & Other AUM0.7 0.9 (0.2) (22)Eliminations(23.2) (21.3) (1.9) (9)Total Assets Under Management661.7 665.2 (3.5) (1)Total Assets Under Administration149.4 144.7 4.7 3Total AUM and AUA$811.1 $809.9 $1.2 — %Total AUM decreased $3.5 billion, or 1%, to $661.7 billion as of June 30, 2015 compared to $665.2 billion as of June 30, 2014 primarily due to a $15.2 billion decrease in Asset Management AUM driven by the negative impact of foreign currency translation, net outflows and retail fund distributions, partially offset by market appreciation, and a $13.8 billion increase in Advice & Wealth Management AUM driven by wrap account net inflows. See our segment results of operations discussion below for additional information on changes in our AUM.57AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. Consolidated Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended June 30, 2015 and 2014 The following table presents our consolidated results of operations: Three Months Ended  June 30,   2015 2014 Change (in millions)  Revenues       Management and financial advice fees$1,518 $1,452 $66 5 %Distribution fees472 470 2 —Net investment income423 433 (10) (2)Premiums368 345 23 7Other revenues354 379 (25) (7)Total revenues3,135 3,079 56 2Banking and deposit interest expense7 7 — —Total net revenues3,128 3,072 56 2Expenses       Distribution expenses835 810 25 3Interest credited to fixed accounts160 175 (15) (9)Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses543 506 37 7Amortization of deferred acquisition costs94 78 16 21Interest and debt expense89 79 10 13General and administrative expense792 805 (13) (2)Total expenses2,513 2,453 60 2Income from continuing operations before income tax provision615 619 (4) (1)Income tax provision139 152 (13) (9)Income from continuing operations476 467 9 2Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax— — — —Net income476 467 9 2Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests61 93 (32) (34)Net income attributable to Ameriprise Financial$415 $374 $41 11 %OverallIncome from continuing operations before income tax provision decreased $4 million, or 1%, to $615 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015 compared to $619 million for the prior year period primarily reflecting a $15 million increase in catastrophe losses, asset management net outflows, the impact on DAC and DSIC from actual versus expected market performance and a decrease in net income from CIEs, partially offset by an $18 million long term care (“LTC”) reserve release in the second quarter of 2015, the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits (net of hedges and the related DSIC and DAC amortization), the impact of market appreciation and wrap account net inflows. The market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits (net of hedges and the related DSIC and DAC amortization) was an expense of $36 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015 compared to an expense of $54 million for the prior year period. The impact on DAC and DSIC from actual versus expected market performance based on our view of bond and equity performance was an expense of $5 million for the second quarter of 2015 compared to a benefit of $16 million for the prior year period as a result of less favorable equity market returns and bond fund returns compared to the prior year period.58AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. Net RevenuesNet revenues increased $56 million, or 2%, to $3.1 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2015 compared to $3.1 billion for the prior year period primarily due to higher management and financial advice fees and premiums, partially offset by a decrease in net investment income and other revenues.Management and financial advice fees increased $66 million, or 5%, to $1.5 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2015 compared to $1.5 billion for the prior year period primarily due to higher asset-based fees driven by an increase in average AUM and an $18 million increase in performance fees. Average AUM increased $15.9 billion, or 2%, compared to the prior year period primarily due to market appreciation and wrap account net inflows, partially offset by asset management net outflows and the negative impact of foreign currency translation. See our discussion on the changes in AUM in our segment results of operations section.Net investment income decreased $10 million, or 2%, to $423 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015 compared to $433 million for the prior year period primarily due to a $20 million decrease in investment income on fixed maturities driven by lower invested assets, partially offset by an $11 million increase in net investment income of CIEs.Premiums increased $23 million, or 7%, to $368 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015 compared to $345 million for the prior year period due to a 7% increase in auto and home policies in force. Other revenues decreased $25 million, or 7%, to $354 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015 compared to $379 million for the prior year period due to a $44 million decrease in other revenues of CIEs, partially offset by higher fees from variable annuity guarantee sales in the prior year where the fees start on the first anniversary date and higher average fee rates and a $7 million gain on the sale of a building. ExpensesTotal expenses increased $60 million, or 2%, to $2.5 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2015 compared to $2.5 billion for the prior year period primarily due to increases in distribution expenses and benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses.Distribution expenses increased $25 million, or 3%, to $835 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015 compared to $810 million for the prior year period driven by higher advisor compensation due to growth in assets under management. See our discussion on the changes in AUM in our segment results of operations section.Interest credited to fixed accounts decreased $15 million, or 9%, to $160 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015 compared to $175 million for the prior year period primarily due to lower average fixed annuity account balances. Average fixed annuity account balances decreased $1.3 billion, or 11%, to $11.4 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2015 compared to the prior year period due to net outflows reflecting higher lapse rates and limited new sales due to low interest rates. Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses increased $37 million, or 7%, to $543 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015 compared to $506 million for the prior year period primarily reflecting the following items:•A $43 million increase in benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses related to our auto and home business due to higher catastrophe losses and an increase in the provision for estimated losses reflecting the impact of growth in exposures from a 7% increase in policies in force and higher 2015 accident year loss ratio assumptions. Catastrophe losses were $48 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015 compared to $33 million for the prior year period. •A $4 million increase in expense related to higher reserve funding driven by the impact of higher fees from variable annuity guarantee sales in the prior year where the fees start on the first anniversary date.•An increase in expenses compared to the prior year period due to a $12 million benefit in the second quarter of 2014 from policyholder movement of investments in Portfolio Navigator (traditional asset allocation) funds under certain in force variable annuities with living benefit guarantees to the Portfolio Stabilizer (managed volatility) funds compared to a $2 million benefit in the second quarter of 2015. See additional discussion in the Annuities segment.•A $4 million increase in expense compared to the prior year period due to the impact on DSIC from actual versus expected market performance based on our view of bond and equity performance. This impact was an expense of $1 million for the second quarter of 2015 compared to a benefit of $3 million for the prior year period as a result of less favorable equity market returns and bond fund returns compared to the prior year period.•An $18 million LTC reserve release in the second quarter of 2015. See additional discussion in the Protection segment.•A $5 million increase in disability income claims due to favorable claims experience in the prior year period and a $4 million increase in life insurance claims reflecting a higher number of variable universal life (“VUL”) claims. 59AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. •A $58 million increase in expense compared to the prior year period from the unhedged nonperformance credit spread risk adjustment on variable annuity guaranteed benefits. As the embedded derivative liability on which the nonperformance credit spread is applied increases (decreases), the impact of the nonperformance credit spread is favorable (unfavorable) to expense. The unfavorable impact of the nonperformance credit spread was $64 million for the second quarter of 2015 compared to an unfavorable impact of $6 million for the prior year period.•An $82 million decrease in expense from other market impacts on variable annuity guaranteed benefits, net of hedges in place to offset those risks and the related DSIC amortization. This decrease was the result of a favorable $789 million change in the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits reserves, an unfavorable $705 million change in the market impact on derivatives hedging the variable annuity guaranteed benefits and an unfavorable $2 million DSIC offset. The main market drivers contributing to these changes are summarized below:•Interest rates were up in the second quarter of 2015 and down in the second quarter of 2014 resulting in a favorable change in the variable annuity guaranteed living benefits liability net of the corresponding change in hedge assets relative to the prior year period. •Equity market impact on the variable annuity guaranteed living benefits liability net of the impact on the corresponding hedge assets resulted in a lower expense in the second quarter of 2015 compared to the prior year period.•Other unhedged items, including the difference between the assumed and actual underlying separate account investment performance, fixed income credit exposures, transaction costs and various behavioral items, were a net unfavorable impact compared to the prior year period.Amortization of DAC increased $16 million, or 21%, to $94 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015 compared to $78 million for the prior year period. The impact on DAC from actual versus expected market performance based on our view of bond and equity performance was an expense of $4 million for the second quarter of 2015 compared to a benefit of $13 million for the prior year period as a result of less favorable equity market returns and bond fund returns compared to the prior year period.Interest and debt expense increased $10 million, or 13%, to $89 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015 compared to $79 million for the prior year period primarily due to a $14 million increase in interest and debt expense of CIEs, partially offset by expenses related to the early redemption of our senior notes due 2039 in the second quarter of 2014.General and administrative expenses decreased $13 million, or 2%, to $792 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015 compared to $805 million for the prior year period primarily due to a $7 million positive impact of foreign exchange and provisions for regulatory reserves in the second quarter of 2014, partially offset by an $8 million increase in compensation related to higher performance fees.Income TaxesOur effective tax rate on income from continuing operations including income attributable to noncontrolling interests was 22.6% for the three months ended June 30, 2015 compared to 24.5% for the prior year period. Our effective tax rate on income from continuing operations excluding income attributable to noncontrolling interests was 25.1% for the three months ended June 30, 2015 compared to 28.7% for the prior year period. The effective tax rates for the three months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014 were lower than the statutory rate as a result of tax preferred items including the dividends received deduction and low income housing tax credits. 60AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. Results of Operations by Segment for the Three Months Ended June 30, 2015 and 2014 Operating earnings is the measure of segment profit or loss management uses to evaluate segment performance. Operating earnings should not be viewed as a substitute for GAAP income from continuing operations before income tax provision. We believe the presentation of segment operating earnings as we measure it for management purposes enhances the understanding of our business by reflecting the underlying performance of our core operations and facilitating a more meaningful trend analysis. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the presentation of segment results and our definition of operating earnings.The following table presents summary financial information by segment: Three Months Ended June 30, 2015 2014 (in millions)Advice & Wealth Management   Net revenues$1,274 $1,198Expenses1,054 1,004Operating earnings$220 $194Asset Management   Net revenues$832 $844Expenses635 645Operating earnings$197 $199Annuities   Net revenues$651 $651Expenses501 481Operating earnings$150 $170Protection   Net revenues$600 $579Expenses528 488Operating earnings$72 $91Corporate & Other   Net revenues$(2) $(2)Expenses55 73Operating loss$(57) $(75)Advice & Wealth ManagementOur Advice & Wealth Management segment provides financial planning and advice, as well as full-service brokerage services, primarily to retail clients through our advisors. These services are centered on long-term, personal relationships between our advisors and our clients and focus on helping clients confidently achieve their financial goals. Our advisors provide a distinctive approach to financial planning and have access to a broad selection of both affiliated and non-affiliated products to help clients meet their financial needs. A significant portion of revenues in this segment is fee-based, driven by the level of client assets, which is impacted by both market movements and net asset flows. We also earn net investment income on invested assets primarily from certificate products. This segment earns revenues (distribution fees) for distributing non-affiliated products and intersegment revenues (distribution fees) for distributing our affiliated products and services to our retail clients. Intersegment expenses for this segment include expenses for investment management services provided by the Asset Management segment.In addition to purchases of affiliated and non-affiliated mutual funds and other securities on a stand-alone basis, clients may purchase mutual funds, among other securities, in connection with investment advisory fee-based “wrap account” programs or services, and pay fees based on a percentage of their assets.61AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC.

We provide clients with U.S. domestic individual products through unaffiliated third party financial institutions and through our Advice & Wealth Management segment, and we provide institutional products and services through our institutional sales force. International retail products are primarily distributed through third-party financial institutions and unaffiliated financial advisors. Individual products include U.S. mutual funds and non-U.S. equivalents, exchange-traded funds and variable product funds underlying insurance and annuity separate accounts. Institutional asset management services are designed to meet specific client objectives and may involve a range of products, including those that focus on traditional asset classes, separately managed accounts, individually managed accounts, collateralized loan obligations, hedge funds, collective funds and property funds. Collateralized loan obligations, hedge funds and certain private funds are often classified as alternative assets. Revenues in this segment are primarily earned as fees based on managed asset balances, which are impacted by market movements, net asset flows, asset allocation and product mix. We may also earn performance fees from certain accounts where investment performance meets or exceeds certain pre-identified targets. Our Asset Management segment also provides intercompany asset management services for Ameriprise Financial subsidiaries. The fees for such services are reflected within the Asset Management segment results through intersegment transfer pricing. Intersegment expenses for this segment include distribution expenses for services provided by our Advice & Wealth Management, Annuities and Protection segments.From time to time, fee waivers have been provided to the Columbia Money Market Funds (the “Funds”) by Columbia Management and certain other subsidiaries performing services for the Funds for the purpose of reducing the expenses charged to a Fund in a given period to maintain or improve a Fund’s net yield in that period. Our subsidiaries may enter into contractual arrangements with the Funds identifying the specific fees to be waived and/or expenses to be reimbursed, as well as the time period for which such waivers will apply. In aggregate, we voluntarily waived fees of $2 million and $3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively.63AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC.

Mutual fund performance rankings are based on the performance of Class Z fund shares for Columbia branded mutual funds. Only funds with Class Z shares are included. In instances where a fund’s Class Z shares do not have a full five year track record, performance for an older share class of the same fund, typically Class A shares, is utilized for the period before Class Z shares were launched. No adjustments to the historical track records are made to account for differences in fund expenses between share classes of a fund.Equal Weighted Rankings in Top 2 Quartiles: Counts the number of funds with above median ranking divided by the total number of funds. Asset size is not a factor.Asset Weighted Rankings in Top 2 Quartiles: Sums the total assets of the funds with above median ranking (using Class Z and appended Class Z) divided by total assets of all funds.

Total segment AUM net outflows were $2.0 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2015. Management expects, consistent with prior patterns of outflows, that outflows of primarily low margin assets directly or indirectly affiliated with Threadneedle and Columbia former parent companies will continue for the foreseeable future. The overall impact to segment results is difficult to quantify due to uncertain timing, volume and mix of the outflows. Columbia managed assets decreased $5.7 billion, or 2%, during the three months ended June 30, 2015 primarily due to retail fund distributions. Columbia retail funds decreased $4.7 billion, or 2%, during the three months ended June 30, 2015 primarily due to distributions. Columbia retail net outflows of $0.7 billion during the second quarter of 2015 included $2.6 billion of outflows in the Columbia Acorn Fund reflecting elevated outflows related to underperformance and $0.4 billion of outflows from a former parent affiliated distribution relationship, offset by normal seasonal increases in reinvested dividends.Threadneedle managed assets increased $3.5 billion, or 2%, during the three months ended June 30, 2015 primarily due to a $9.3 billion positive impact of foreign currency translation, partially offset by market depreciation of $5.6 billion and net outflows of $0.8 billion. Threadneedle retail funds increased $1.8 billion, or 4%, during the three months ended June 30, 2015 due to a $3.0 billion 68AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. positive impact of foreign currency translation and net inflows of $0.8 billion, partially offset by market depreciation. Threadneedle institutional AUM increased $1.8 billion, or 2%, during the three months ended June 30, 2015 primarily due to a $6.3 billion positive impact of foreign currency translation, partially offset by net outflows and market depreciation. Threadneedle institutional net outflows of $1.6 billion during the second quarter of 2015 included outflows of $2.7 billion from legacy insurance assets that were elevated by $1.7 billion in the quarter due to the client’s sale of a related business, partially offset by new third party mandates.

Net RevenuesNet revenues, which exclude net realized investment gains or losses, decreased $12 million, or 1%, to $832 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015 compared to $844 million for the prior year period primarily due to net outflows, a $17 million negative impact of foreign exchange, and a $23 million benefit from a CLO liquidation in the prior year period, partially offset by market appreciation and higher performance fees.Management and financial advice fees decreased $11 million, or 2%, to $696 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015 compared to $707 million for the prior year period primarily due to a $17 million negative impact of foreign exchange and a $14 million benefit from a CLO liquidation in the prior year period, partially offset by a $16 million increase in performance fees. Average assets under management were essentially flat compared to the prior year period as equity market appreciation was offset by net outflows and the negative impact of foreign currency translation.Net investment income decreased $9 million, or 69%, to $4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015 compared to $13 million for the prior year period due to a $9 million benefit from a CLO liquidation in the prior year period.ExpensesTotal expenses decreased $10 million, or 2%, to $635 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015 compared to $645 million for the prior year period primarily due to an $11 million benefit from the impact of foreign exchange, a decrease in distribution expenses from lower retail fund assets, and a $6 million expense from a CLO liquidation in the prior year period, partially offset by an $8 million increase in compensation related to higher performance fees. 69AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. AnnuitiesOur Annuities segment provides variable and fixed annuity products of RiverSource Life companies to individual clients. We provide our variable annuity products through our advisors, and our fixed annuity products are distributed through both affiliated and unaffiliated advisors and financial institutions. Revenues from our variable annuity products are primarily earned as fees based on underlying account balances, which are impacted by both market movements and net asset flows. Revenues from our fixed annuity products are primarily earned as net investment income on assets supporting fixed account balances, with profitability significantly impacted by the spread between net investment income earned and interest credited on the fixed account balances. We also earn net investment income on owned assets supporting reserves for immediate annuities and for certain guaranteed benefits offered with variable annuities and on capital supporting the business. Intersegment revenues for this segment reflect fees paid by our Asset Management segment for marketing support and other services provided in connection with the availability of variable insurance trust funds (“VIT Funds”) under the variable annuity contracts. Intersegment expenses for this segment include distribution expenses for services provided by our Advice & Wealth Management segment, as well as expenses for investment management services provided by our Asset Management segment.The following table presents the results of operations of our Annuities segment on an operating basis: Three Months Ended  June 30,     2015 2014 Change (in millions)  Revenues       Management and financial advice fees$192 $189 $3 2 %Distribution fees94 91 3 3Net investment income218 234 (16) (7)Premiums30 32 (2) (6)Other revenues117 105 12 11Total revenues651 651 — —Banking and deposit interest expense— — — —Total net revenues651 651 — —Expenses       Distribution expenses116 109 7 6Interest credited to fixed accounts125 139 (14) (10)Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses135 113 22 19Amortization of deferred acquisition costs59 51 8 16Interest and debt expense9 9 — —General and administrative expense57 60 (3) (5)Total expenses501 481 20 4Operating earnings$150 $170 $(20) (12)%Our Annuities segment pretax operating income, which excludes net realized investment gains or losses and the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits (net of hedges and the related DSIC and DAC amortization), decreased $20 million, or 12%, to $150 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015 compared to $170 million for the prior year period primarily due to the impact on DAC and DSIC from actual versus expected market performance, which was an expense of $5 million for the second quarter of 2015 compared to a benefit of $15 million for the prior year period, and a lower benefit in the second quarter of 2015 from policyholder movement of investments in Portfolio Navigator funds under certain in force variable annuities with living benefit guarantees to the Portfolio Stabilizer funds compared to the prior year period, partially offset by higher fees from variable annuity guarantees, net of related reserves.During 2013, we added Portfolio Stabilizer fund options for our in force variable annuities with living benefit guarantees. During the second quarter of 2014, approximately $1.5 billion of account value was moved into these funds, exceeding expectations. The resulting earnings benefit for the second quarter of 2014 was $10 million. This compares to a benefit of $2 million for the second quarter of 2015. We anticipate a very minimal benefit to earnings going forward.RiverSource variable annuity account balances decreased 1% to $77.1 billion at June 30, 2015 compared to the prior year period due to net outflows of $1.6 billion, partially offset by market appreciation. 70AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. RiverSource fixed annuity account balances declined 11% to $11.2 billion at June 30, 2015 compared to the prior year period reflecting limited sales from low rates and higher lapse rates related to the re-pricing of the five-year guarantee block during 2014, a portion of which came out of its surrender charge period during the first half of 2015. The change in crediting rates decreased the level of spread compression in both periods. Net RevenuesNet revenues, which exclude net realized investment gains or losses, were flat compared to the prior year period reflecting the impact of market appreciation and higher fees from variable annuity guarantees offset by net outflows.Net investment income, which excludes net realized investment gains or losses, decreased $16 million, or 7%, to $218 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015 compared to $234 million for the prior year period primarily reflecting lower invested assets due to fixed annuity net outflows.Other revenues increased $12 million, or 11%, to $117 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015 compared to $105 million for the prior year period due to higher fees from variable annuity guarantee sales in the prior year where the fees start on the first anniversary date and higher average fee rates.ExpensesTotal expenses, which exclude the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits (net of hedges and the related DSIC and DAC amortization), increased $20 million, or 4%, to $501 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015 compared to $481 million for the prior year period primarily due to the impact on DAC and DSIC from actual versus expected market performance and a decrease in the benefit from policyholder movement of investments in Portfolio Navigator funds under certain in-force variable annuities with living benefit riders to the Portfolio Stabilizer funds, partially offset by a decrease in interested credited to fixed accounts. Interest credited to fixed accounts decreased $14 million, or 10%, to $125 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015 compared to $139 million for the prior year period driven by lower average fixed annuity account balances. Average fixed annuity account balances decreased $1.3 billion, or 11%, to $11.4 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2015 compared to the prior year period due to net outflows reflecting higher lapse rates and limited new sales due to low interest rates.Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses, which exclude the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits (net of hedges and the related DSIC amortization), increased $22 million, or 19%, to $135 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015 compared to $113 million for the prior year period primarily reflecting the following items:•A $4 million increase in expense related to higher reserve funding driven by the impact of higher fees from variable annuity guarantee sales in the prior year where the fees start on the first anniversary date.•An increase in expenses compared to the prior year period due to a $12 million benefit in the second quarter of 2014 from policyholder movement of investments in Portfolio Navigator funds under certain in force variable annuities with living benefit guarantees to the Portfolio Stabilizer funds compared to a $2 million benefit in the second quarter of 2015. •A $4 million increase in expense compared to the prior year period due to the impact on DSIC from actual versus expected market performance based on our view of bond and equity performance. This impact was an expense of $1 million for the second quarter of 2015 compared to a benefit of $3 million for the prior year period as a result of less favorable equity market returns and bond fund returns compared to the prior year period.Amortization of DAC, which excludes the DAC offset to the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits, increased $8 million, or 16%, to $59 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015 compared to $51 million for the prior year period. The impact on DAC from actual versus expected market performance based on our view of bond and equity performance was an expense of $4 million for the second quarter of 2015 compared to a benefit of $12 million for the prior year period. Amortization of DAC for the second quarter of 2014 included a $2 million expense for the offset of the benefit from policyholder movement of investments in Portfolio Navigator funds under certain in force variable annuities with living benefit guarantees to the Portfolio Stabilizer funds compared to nil for the second quarter of 2015.71AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. ProtectionOur Protection segment offers a variety of products to address the protection and risk management needs of our retail clients including life, DI and property casualty insurance. Life and DI products are primarily provided through our advisors. Our property casualty products are sold primarily through affinity relationships. We issue insurance policies through our life insurance and property casualty subsidiaries. The primary sources of revenues for this segment are premiums, fees and charges we receive to assume insurance-related risk. We earn net investment income on owned assets supporting insurance reserves and capital supporting the business. We also receive fees based on the level of assets supporting VUL separate account balances. This segment earns intersegment revenues from fees paid by our Asset Management segment for marketing support and other services provided in connection with the availability of VIT Funds under the VUL contracts. Intersegment expenses for this segment include distribution expenses for services provided by our Advice & Wealth Management segment, as well as expenses for investment management services provided by our Asset Management segment.The following table presents the results of operations of our Protection segment on an operating basis: Three Months Ended  June 30,     2015 2014 Change (in millions)  Revenues       Management and financial advice fees$13 $15 $(2) (13)%Distribution fees24 22 2 9Net investment income118 113 5 4Premiums341 317 24 8Other revenues104 112 (8) (7)Total revenues600 579 21 4Banking and deposit interest expense— — — —Total net revenues600 579 21 4Expenses       Distribution expenses16 16 — —Interest credited to fixed accounts39 37 2 5Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses368 329 39 12Amortization of deferred acquisition costs35 36 (1) (3)Interest and debt expense8 7 1 14General and administrative expense62 63 (1) (2)Total expenses528 488 40 8Operating earnings$72 $91 $(19) (21)%Our Protection segment pretax operating income, which excludes net realized investment gains or losses and the market impact on indexed universal life benefits (net of hedges and the related DAC amortization, unearned revenue amortization and the reinsurance accrual), decreased $19 million, or 21%, to $72 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015 compared to $91 million for the prior year period primarily due to higher auto and home losses and higher life and disability claims, partially offset by an $18 million LTC reserve release.During the quarter we completed our review of the disabled life reserve for a closed block of long term care insurance policies, which resulted in a favorable reserve release in the quarter. In the first quarter of 2015, we increased disabled life reserves by a net $32 million based primarily on claims utilization and termination assumptions provided by our reinsurer. During the second quarter, we completed the analysis of actual claims experience for this block of business. Based on the analysis, we concluded that the actual claims utilization and termination experience was more favorable than the initial assumptions provided by the reinsurer, and as a result, released $18 million of the net $32 million reserve. Net RevenuesNet revenues, which exclude net realized investment gains or losses and the unearned revenue amortization and the reinsurance accrual offset to the market impact on indexed universal life benefits, increased $21 million, or 4%, to $600 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015 compared to $579 million for the prior year period primarily due to growth in auto and home premiums.Premiums increased $24 million, or 8%, to $341 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015 compared to $317 million for the prior year period due to a 7% increase in auto and home policies in force.72AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. ExpensesTotal expenses, which exclude the market impact on indexed universal life benefits (net of hedges and the related DAC amortization), increased $40 million, or 8%, to $528 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015 compared to $488 million for the prior year period primarily due to higher benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses. Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses increased $39 million, or 12%, to $368 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015 compared to $329 million for the prior year period primarily due to an increase in auto and home reserves, higher catastrophe losses, a $5 million increase in disability income claims due to favorable claims experience in the prior year period and a $4 million increase in life insurance claims reflecting a higher number of VUL claims, partially offset by an $18 million LTC reserve release. Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses related to our auto and home business increased $43 million due to higher catastrophe losses and an increase in the provision for estimated losses reflecting the impact of growth in exposures from a 7% increase in policies in force and higher 2015 accident year loss ratio assumptions. Catastrophe losses were $48 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015 compared to $33 million for the prior year period.Corporate & OtherOur Corporate & Other segment consists of net investment income or loss on corporate level assets, including excess capital held in our subsidiaries and other unallocated equity and other revenues as well as unallocated corporate expenses. The Corporate & Other segment also includes revenues and expenses of CIEs, which are excluded on an operating basis.The following table presents the results of operations of our Corporate & Other segment on an operating basis: Three Months Ended  June 30,     2015 2014 Change (in millions)  Revenues       Net investment loss$(10) $(5) $(5) NMOther revenues8 3 5 NMTotal revenues(2) (2) — — %Banking and deposit interest expense— — — —Total net revenues(2) (2) — —Expenses       Interest and debt expense4 9 (5) (56)General and administrative expense51 64 (13) (20)Total expenses55 73 (18) (25)Operating loss$(57) $(75) $18 24 %NM Not Meaningful.Our Corporate & Other segment pretax operating loss excludes net realized investment gains or losses, the market impact of hedges to offset interest rate changes on unrealized gains or losses for certain investments, integration and restructuring charges, and the impact of consolidating CIEs. Our Corporate & Other segment pretax operating loss decreased $18 million, or 24%, to $57 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015 compared to $75 million for the prior year period primarily due to higher expenses in the prior year period related to the early redemption of our senior notes due 2039 and a provision for potential resolution of a regulatory matter. Net revenues were flat compared to the prior year period reflecting a $7 million gain on the sale of a building in the second quarter of 2015 offset by higher net investment losses due to an increase in losses associated with affordable housing partnerships and the impact of interest allocation between operating segments.73AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. Consolidated Results of Operations for the Six Months Ended June 30, 2015 and 2014 The following table presents our consolidated results of operations: Six Months Ended  June 30,   2015 2014 Change (in millions)  Revenues       Management and financial advice fees$2,986 $2,838 $148 5 %Distribution fees938 946 (8) (1)Net investment income907 904 3 —Premiums721 675 46 7Other revenues643 719 (76) (11)Total revenues6,195 6,082 113 2Banking and deposit interest expense14 14 — —Total net revenues6,181 6,068 113 2Expenses       Distribution expenses1,654 1,596 58 4Interest credited to fixed accounts332 361 (29) (8)Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses1,076 956 120 13Amortization of deferred acquisition costs169 165 4 2Interest and debt expense173 158 15 9General and administrative expense1,544 1,563 (19) (1)Total expenses4,948 4,799 149 3Income from continuing operations before income tax provision1,233 1,269 (36) (3)Income tax provision278 286 (8) (3)Income from continuing operations955 983 (28) (3)Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax— (1) 1 NMNet income955 982 (27) (3)Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests147 208 (61) (29)Net income attributable to Ameriprise Financial$808 $774 $34 4 %NM Not Meaningful.OverallIncome from continuing operations before income tax provision decreased $36 million, or 3%, to $1.2 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2015 compared to $1.3 billion for the prior year period primarily reflecting a net $14 million LTC reserve increase, a $37 million benefit in the prior year period from policyholder movement of investments in Portfolio Navigator funds under certain in force variable annuities with living benefit guarantees to the Portfolio Stabilizer funds compared to a $4 million benefit in the current period, the impact on DAC and DSIC from actual versus expected market performance, asset management net outflows and a decrease in net income from CIEs, partially offset by the impact of market appreciation, higher performance fees and wrap account net inflows. The impact on DAC and DSIC from actual versus expected market performance based on our view of bond and equity performance was a benefit of $6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015 compared to a benefit of $24 million for the prior year period as a result of less favorable equity market returns and bond fund returns compared to the prior year period.Net RevenuesNet revenues increased $113 million, or 2%, to $6.2 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2015 compared to $6.1 billion for the prior year period due to higher management and financial advice fees and premiums, partially offset by a decrease in other revenues.Management and financial advice fees increased $148 million, or 5%, to $3.0 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2015 compared to $2.8 billion for the prior year period primarily due to higher asset-based fees driven by an increase in average AUM and a $21 million increase in performance fees. Average AUM increased $20.7 billion, or 3%, compared to the prior year period primarily due to market appreciation and wrap account net inflows, partially offset by asset management net outflows and the negative impact of foreign currency translation. See our discussion on the changes in AUM in our segment results of operations section. Net investment income increased $3 million to $907 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015 compared to $904 million for the prior year period primarily due to a $42 million increase in net investment income of CIEs, partially offset by a $40 million decrease 74AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. in investment income on fixed maturities driven by a decrease in invested assets and low interest rates.Premiums increased $46 million, or 7%, to $721 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015 compared to $675 million for the prior year period due to a 7% increase in auto and home policies in force. Other revenues decreased $76 million, or 11%, to $643 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015 compared to $719 million for the prior year period due to a $103 million decrease in other revenues of CIEs, partially offset by higher fees from variable annuity guarantee sales in the prior year where the fees start on the first anniversary date and higher average fee rates. ExpensesTotal expenses increased $149 million, or 3%, to $4.9 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2015 compared to $4.8 billion for the prior year period primarily due to increases in distribution expenses and benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses, partially offset by a decrease in interest credited to fixed accounts.Distribution expenses increased $58 million, or 4%, to $1.7 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2015 compared to $1.6 billion for the prior year period driven by higher advisor compensation due to growth in assets under management. See our discussion on the changes in AUM in our segment results of operations section.Interest credited to fixed accounts decreased $29 million, or 8%, to $332 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015 compared to $361 million for the prior year period primarily due to lower average fixed annuity account balances and a lower average crediting rate on interest sensitive fixed annuities. Average fixed annuity account balances decreased $1.3 billion, or 10%, to $11.7 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2015 compared to the prior year period due to net outflows reflecting higher lapse rates and limited new sales due to low interest rates. The average fixed annuity crediting rate excluding capitalized interest decreased to 3.0% for the six months ended June 30, 2015 compared to 3.2% for the prior year period reflecting the re-pricing of the five-year guarantee block. Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses increased $120 million, or 13%, to $1.1 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2015 compared to $956 million for the prior year period primarily reflecting the following items:•A $46 million increase in benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses related to our auto and home business due to an increase in the provision for estimated losses reflecting the impact of growth in exposures from a 7% increase in policies in force and higher 2015 accident year loss ratio assumptions. Auto and home losses for the prior year period included a $30 million impact related to an increase to prior accident year loss reserves and $11 million from non-catastrophe weather-related losses in the first quarter of 2014. Catastrophe losses were $57 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015 compared to $42 million for the prior year period.•A $9 million increase in expense related to higher reserve funding driven by the impact of higher fees from variable annuity guarantee sales in the prior year where the fees start on the first anniversary date.•An increase in expenses compared to the prior year period due to a $44 million benefit in the first half of 2014 from policyholder movement of investments in Portfolio Navigator funds under certain in force variable annuities with living benefit guarantees to the Portfolio Stabilizer funds compared to a $5 million benefit in the first half of 2015. See additional discussion in the Annuities segment.•A net $14 million increase in LTC reserves for the six months ended June 30, 2015. See additional discussion in the Protection segment.•A $7 million favorable impact from a change in the discount rate for disability income products in the first quarter of 2015.•A $4 million increase in expense compared to the prior year period due to the impact on DSIC from actual versus expected market performance based on our view of bond and equity performance. This impact was a benefit of $1 million for the first half of 2015 compared to a benefit of $5 million for the prior year period as a result of less favorable equity market returns and bond fund returns compared to the prior year period.•A $29 million increase in expense compared to the prior year period from the unhedged nonperformance credit spread risk adjustment on variable annuity guaranteed benefits. As the embedded derivative liability on which the nonperformance credit spread is applied increases (decreases), the impact of the nonperformance credit spread is favorable (unfavorable) to expense. The unfavorable impact of the nonperformance credit spread was $20 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015 compared to a favorable impact of $9 million for the prior year period.•A $30 million decrease in expense from other market impacts on variable annuity guaranteed benefits, net of hedges in place to offset those risks and the related DSIC amortization. This decrease was the result of a favorable $551 million change in the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits reserves, an unfavorable $519 million change in the market impact on derivatives hedging the variable annuity guaranteed benefits and an unfavorable $2 million DSIC offset. The main market drivers contributing to these changes are summarized below:•Interest rates were up in the first half of 2015 and down in the first half of 2014 resulting in a favorable change in the variable annuity guaranteed living benefits liability net of the corresponding change in hedge assets relative to the prior year period. 75AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. •Impacts of equity market and equity volatility on the variable annuity guaranteed living benefits liability net of the impacts on the corresponding hedge assets resulted in a lower expense in the first half of 2015 compared to the prior year period.•Other unhedged items, including the difference between the assumed and actual underlying separate account investment performance, fixed income credit exposures, transaction costs and various behavioral items, were a net unfavorable impact compared to the prior year period.Interest and debt expense increased $15 million, or 9%, to $173 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015 compared to $158 million for the prior year period due to a $17 million increase in interest and debt expense of CIEs.General and administrative expenses decreased $19 million, or 1%, to $1.5 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2015 compared to $1.6 billion for the prior year period primarily due to a $16 million positive impact of foreign exchange and provisions for regulatory reserves in the second quarter of 2014, partially offset by a $12 million increase in compensation related to higher performance fees.Income TaxesOur effective tax rate on income from continuing operations including income attributable to noncontrolling interests was 22.6% for the six months ended June 30, 2015 compared to 22.5% for the prior year period. Our effective tax rate on income from continuing operations excluding income attributable to noncontrolling interests was 25.6% for the six months ended June 30, 2015 compared to 26.9% for the prior year period. The effective tax rates for the six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014 were lower than the statutory rate as a result of tax preferred items including the dividends received deduction and low income housing tax credits.

Total segment AUM net outflows were $7.8 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2015. Management expects, consistent with prior patterns of outflows, that outflows of primarily low margin assets directly or indirectly affiliated with Threadneedle and Columbia former parent companies will continue for the foreseeable future. The overall impact to segment results is difficult to quantify due to uncertain timing, volume and mix of the outflows. Columbia managed assets decreased $2.7 billion, or 1%, during the six months ended June 30, 2015 primarily due to net outflows and retail fund distributions, partially offset by market appreciation. Columbia retail funds decreased $2.9 billion, or 1%, during the six months ended June 30, 2015 due to net outflows and distributions, partially offset by market appreciation. Columbia retail net outflows of $3.6 billion during the first half of 2015 included $4.9 billion of outflows in the Columbia Acorn Fund reflecting elevated outflows related to underperformance and $0.9 billion of outflows from a former parent affiliated distribution relationship, offset by normal seasonal increases in reinvested dividends in the second quarter. Columbia institutional AUM increased $0.6 billion, or 1%, during the six months ended June 30, 2015 due to market appreciation, partially offset by net outflows of $0.5 billion. 80AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. Threadneedle managed assets increased $2.8 billion, or 2%, during the six months ended June 30, 2015 primarily due to a positive impact of foreign currency translation and market appreciation, partially offset by net outflows of $1.9 billion. Threadneedle retail funds increased $2.4 billion, or 5%, during the six months ended June 30, 2015 due to market appreciation, net inflows of $1.3 billion and a positive impact of foreign currency translation. Threadneedle institutional AUM increased $0.5 billion during the six months ended June 30, 2015 primarily due to market appreciation and other and a positive impact of foreign currency translation, partially offset by net outflows. Threadneedle institutional net outflows of $3.2 billion during the first half of 2015 included outflows of $3.5 billion from legacy insurance assets that were elevated by $1.7 billion in the second quarter due to the client’s sale of a related business and $0.9 billion from an institutional insurance client in the first quarter of 2015 associated with asset reallocation to funds we do not offer, partially offset by new third party mandates.

RiverSource fixed annuity account balances declined 11% to $11.2 billion at June 30, 2015 compared to the prior year period reflecting limited sales from low rates and higher lapse rates related to the re-pricing of the five-year guarantee block during 2014, a portion of which came out of its surrender charge period during the first half of 2015. The change in crediting rates decreased the level of spread compression in both periods.Net RevenuesNet revenues, which exclude net realized investment gains or losses, were essentially flat at $1.3 billion compared to the prior year period reflecting the impact of outflows offset by market appreciation and higher fees from variable annuity guarantees.Management and financial advice fees increased $10 million, or 3%, to $382 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015 compared to $372 million for the prior year period due to higher fees on variable annuities as a result of higher average separate account balances. Average variable annuity account balances increased $2.3 billion, or 3%, compared to the prior year period due to market appreciation, partially offset by net outflows.Net investment income, which excludes net realized investment gains or losses, decreased $37 million, or 8%, to $439 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015 compared to $476 million for the prior year period primarily reflecting lower invested assets due to fixed annuity net outflows.Other revenues increased $24 million, or 12%, to $226 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015 compared to $202 million for the prior year period due to higher fees from variable annuity guarantee sales in the prior year where the fees start on the first anniversary date, as well as higher average fee rates.82AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. ExpensesTotal expenses, which exclude the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits (net of hedges and the related DSIC and DAC amortization), increased $19 million, or 2%, to $960 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015 compared to $941 million for the prior year period primarily due to higher benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses, partially offset by lower interest credited to fixed accounts. Interest credited to fixed accounts decreased $35 million, or 12%, to $252 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015 compared to $287 million for the prior year period driven by lower average fixed annuity account balances and a lower average crediting rate on interest sensitive fixed annuities. Average fixed annuity account balances decreased $1.3 billion, or 10%, to $11.7 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2015 compared to the prior year period due to net outflows reflecting higher lapse rates and limited new sales due to low interest rates. The average fixed annuity crediting rate excluding capitalized interest decreased to 3.0% for the six months ended June 30, 2015 compared to 3.2% for the prior year period reflecting the re-pricing of the five-year guarantee block.Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses, which exclude the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits (net of hedges and the related DSIC amortization), increased $51 million, or 26%, to $250 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015 compared to $199 million for the prior year period primarily reflecting the following items: •A $9 million increase in expense related to higher reserve funding driven by the impact of higher fees from variable annuity guarantee sales in the prior year where the fees start on the first anniversary date.•An increase in expenses compared to the prior year period due to a $46 million benefit in the first half of 2014 from policyholder movement of investments in Portfolio Navigator funds under certain in force variable annuities with living benefit guarantees to the Portfolio Stabilizer funds compared to a $5 million benefit in the first half of 2015. •A $4 million increase in expense compared to the prior year period due to the impact on DSIC from actual versus expected market performance based on our view of bond and equity performance. This impact was a benefit of $1 million for the first half of 2015 compared to a benefit of $5 million for the prior year period as a result of less favorable equity market returns and bond fund returns compared to the prior year period.ProtectionThe following table presents the results of operations of our Protection segment on an operating basis: Six Months Ended  June 30,     2015 2014 Change (in millions)  Revenues       Management and financial advice fees$28 $30 $(2) (7)%Distribution fees47 45 2 4Net investment income232 221 11 5Premiums676 625 51 8Other revenues207 213 (6) (3)Total revenues1,190 1,134 56 5Banking and deposit interest expense— — — —Total net revenues1,190 1,134 56 5Expenses       Distribution expenses29 30 (1) (3)Interest credited to fixed accounts79 75 4 5Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses748 678 70 10Amortization of deferred acquisition costs71 64 7 11Interest and debt expense16 14 2 14General and administrative expense124 123 1 1Total expenses1,067 984 83 8Operating earnings$123 $150 $(27) (18)%83AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. Our Protection segment pretax operating income, which excludes net realized investment gains or losses and the market impact on indexed universal life benefits (net of hedges and the related DAC amortization, unearned revenue amortization and the reinsurance accrual), decreased $27 million, or 18%, to $123 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015 compared to $150 million for the prior year period primarily due to a net $14 million LTC reserve increase and higher life and health insurance claims, partially offset by a $7 million favorable impact from a change in the discount rate for disability insurance products in the first quarter of 2015.During the first quarter of 2015, we conducted a review of our LTC reserve for unpaid amounts on reported claims based on additional information we received from Genworth Financial, Inc., which reinsures 50% of our LTC business and administers all of our claims. Based on this information, along with a review of the discount rate, management’s best estimate for LTC claims reserves resulted in a net $32 million increase during the first quarter of 2015. The most significant drivers of the reserve increase were updates to the benefit utilization rates and claims termination rates, partially offset by a $15 million benefit from a higher discount rate. During the second quarter of 2015, we completed our review which resulted in a favorable reserve release. Based on the analysis, we concluded that the actual claims utilization and termination experience was more favorable than the initial assumptions provided by the reinsurer, and as a result, released $18 million of the net $32 million reserve. We also increased the discount rate for our disability income (“DI”) reserve for unpaid amounts on reported claims, which resulted in a $7 million reserve decrease in the first quarter of 2015. The current discount rates are based on the average interest rates earned on assets supporting the liability and were 6.25% and 5.0% for LTC and DI, respectively, at June 30, 2015.Net RevenuesNet revenues, which exclude net realized investment gains or losses and the unearned revenue amortization and the reinsurance accrual offset to the market impact on indexed universal life benefits, increased $56 million, or 5%, to $1.2 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2015 compared to $1.1 billion for the prior year period primarily due to growth in auto and home premiums.Premiums increased $51 million, or 8%, to $676 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015 compared to $625 million for the prior year period primarily due to a 7% increase in auto and home policies in force.ExpensesTotal expenses, which exclude the market impact on indexed universal life benefits (net of hedges and the related DAC amortization), increased $83 million, or 8%, to $1.1 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2015 compared to $984 million for the prior year period primarily due to higher benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses. Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses increased $70 million, or 10%, to $748 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015 compared to $678 million for the prior year period primarily due to a net $14 million LTC reserve increase, higher life and health insurance claims and an increase in auto and home reserves, partially offset by a $7 million favorable impact from a change in the discount rate for DI insurance products. Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses related to our auto and home business increased $46 million due to an increase in the provision for estimated losses reflecting the impact of growth in exposures from a 7% increase in policies in force and higher 2015 accident year loss ratio assumptions. Auto and home losses for the prior year period included a $30 million impact related to an increase to prior accident year loss reserves and $11 million from non-catastrophe weather-related losses in the first quarter of 2014. Catastrophe losses were $57 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015 compared to $42 million for the prior year period. 84AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC.

Our Corporate & Other segment pretax operating loss decreased $11 million, or 8%, to $119 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015 compared to $130 million for the prior year period primarily due to higher expenses in the prior year period related to the early redemption of our senior notes due 2039 and a provision for potential resolution of a regulatory matter, partially offset by a decrease in net revenues. Net revenues decreased $12 million compared to the prior year period reflecting higher net investment losses due to an increase in losses associated with affordable housing partnerships and the impact of interest allocation between operating segments, partially offset by a $7 million gain on the sale of a building in the second quarter of 2015.Market RiskOur primary market risk exposures are interest rate, equity price, foreign currency exchange rate and credit risk. Equity price and interest rate fluctuations can have a significant impact on our results of operations, primarily due to the effects they have on the asset management and other asset-based fees we earn, the spread income generated on our fixed annuities, fixed insurance, brokerage client cash balances, face-amount certificate products and the fixed portion of our variable annuities and variable insurance contracts, the value of DAC and DSIC assets, the value of liabilities for guaranteed benefits associated with our variable annuities and the value of derivatives held to hedge these benefits.Our earnings from fixed annuities, fixed insurance, and the fixed portion of variable annuities and variable insurance contracts are based upon the spread between rates earned on assets held and the rates at which interest is credited to accounts. We primarily invest in fixed rate securities to fund the rate credited to clients. We guarantee an interest rate to the holders of these products. Investment assets and client liabilities generally differ as it relates to basis, repricing or maturity characteristics. Rates credited to clients’ accounts generally reset at shorter intervals than the yield on the underlying investments. Therefore, in an increasing interest rate environment, higher interest rates may be reflected in crediting rates to clients sooner than in rates earned on invested assets, which could result in a reduced spread between the two rates, reduced earned income and a negative impact on pretax income. However, the current low interest rate environment is resulting in interest rates below the level of some of our liability guaranteed minimum interest rates (“GMIRs”). Hence, a modest rise in interest rates would not necessarily result in changes to all the liability credited rates while projected asset purchases would capture the full increase in interest rates. This dynamic would result in widening spreads under a modestly rising rate scenario given the current relationship between the current level of interest rates and the underlying GMIRs on the business. 85AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. As a result of the low interest rate environment, our current reinvestment yields are generally lower than the current portfolio yield. We expect our portfolio income yields to continue to decline in future periods if interest rates remain low. The carrying value and weighted average yield of non-structured fixed maturity securities and commercial mortgage loans that may generate proceeds to reinvest through June 30, 2017 due to prepayment, maturity or call activity at the option of the issuer, excluding securities with a make-whole provision, were $4.2 billion and 3.6%, respectively, as of June 30, 2015. In addition, residential mortgage-backed securities, which are subject to prepayment risk as a result of the low interest rate environment, totaled $6.1 billion and had a weighted average yield of 2.8% as of June 30, 2015. While these amounts represent investments that could be subject to reinvestment risk, it is also possible that these investments will be used to fund liabilities or may not be prepaid and will remain invested at their current yields. In addition to the interest rate environment, the mix of benefit payments versus product sales as well as the timing and volumes associated with such mix may impact our investment yield. Furthermore, reinvestment activities and the associated investment yield may also be impacted by corporate strategies implemented at management’s discretion. The average yield for investment purchases during the six months ended June 30, 2015 was approximately 2.9%.The reinvestment of proceeds from maturities, calls and prepayments at rates below the current portfolio yield, which may be below the level of some liability guaranteed minimum interest rates, will have a negative impact to future operating results. To mitigate the unfavorable impact that the low interest rate environment has on our spread income, we assess reinvestment risk in our investment portfolio and monitor this risk in accordance with our asset/liability management framework. In addition, we may reduce the crediting rates on our fixed products when warranted, subject to guaranteed minimums. In 2014, we set lower renewal interest rates for a portion of our fixed annuities that were above the guaranteed minimum interest rates, which helped relieve some of the spread compression caused by low rates.The following table presents the account values of fixed annuities, fixed insurance, and the fixed portion of variable annuities and variable insurance contracts by range of guaranteed minimum crediting rates and the range of the difference between rates credited to policyholders and contractholders as of June 30, 2015 and the respective guaranteed minimums, as well as the percentage of account values subject to rate reset in the time period indicated. Rates are reset at our discretion, subject to guaranteed minimums.

In addition to the fixed rate exposures noted above, RiverSource Life also has the following variable annuity guarantee benefits: guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits (“GMWB”), guaranteed minimum accumulation benefits (“GMAB”), guaranteed minimum death benefits (“GMDB”) and guaranteed minimum income benefits (“GMIB”). Each of these guaranteed benefits guarantees payouts to the annuity holder under certain specific conditions regardless of the performance of the underlying invested assets.The variable annuity guarantees continue to be managed by utilizing a hedging program which attempts to match the sensitivity of the assets with the sensitivity of the liabilities. This approach works with the premise that matched sensitivities will produce a highly effective hedging result. Our comprehensive hedging program focuses mainly on first order sensitivities of assets and liabilities: Equity Market Level (Delta), Interest Rate Level (Rho) and Volatility (Vega). Additionally, various second order sensitivities are managed. We use various index options across the term structure, interest rate swaps and swaptions, total return swaps and futures to manage the risk exposures. The exposures are measured and monitored daily, and adjustments to the hedge portfolio are made as necessary.We have a macro hedge program to provide protection against the statutory tail scenario risk arising from variable annuity reserves on our statutory surplus and to cover some of the residual risks not covered by other hedging activities. We assess the residual risk under a range of scenarios in creating and executing the macro hedge program. As a means of economically hedging these risks, we use a combination of options and/or swaps. Certain of the macro hedge derivatives used contain settlement provisions linked to both equity returns and interest rates; the remaining are interest rate contracts or equity contracts. The macro hedge program could result in additional earnings volatility as changes in the value of the macro hedge derivatives, which are designed to reduce statutory capital volatility, may not be closely aligned to changes in the variable annuity guarantee embedded derivatives.To evaluate interest rate and equity price risk we perform sensitivity testing which measures the impact on pretax income from the sources listed below for a 12-month period following a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates or a hypothetical 10% decline in equity prices. The interest rate risk test assumes a sudden 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve, with rates then staying at those levels for the next 12 months. The equity price risk test assumes a sudden 10% drop in equity prices, with equity prices then staying at those levels for the next 12 months. In estimating the values of variable annuity riders, equity indexed annuities, stock market certificates, indexed universal life insurance and the associated hedge assets, we assume no change in implied market volatility despite the 10% drop in equity prices.The following tables present our estimate of the impact on pretax income from the above defined hypothetical market movements as of June 30, 2015:  Equity Price Exposure to Pretax IncomeEquity Price Decline 10% BeforeHedge Impact Hedge Impact Net Impact  (in millions)Asset-based management and distribution fees (1) $(255) $2 $(253)DAC and DSIC amortization (2) (3) (100) — (100)Variable annuity riders:      GMDB and GMIB (3) (112) — (112)GMWB (288) 300 12GMAB (37) 38 1DAC and DSIC amortization (4) N/A N/A (2)Total variable annuity riders (437) 338 (101)Macro hedge program (5) — 16 16Equity indexed annuities 1 (1) —Certificates 3 (3) —Indexed universal life insurance 17 (21) (4)Total $(771) $331 $(442)87AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC.

This is a significantly more conservative estimate than if we assumed management follows its mean reversion guideline and increased near-term rates to recover the drop in equity values over a five-year period. We make this same conservative assumption in estimating the impact from GMDB and GMIB riders.(4) Market impact on DAC and DSIC amortization related to variable annuity riders is modeled net of hedge impact.(5) The market impact of the macro hedge program is modeled net of any related impact to DAC and DSIC amortization.The above results compare to an estimated negative net impact to pretax income of $435 million related to a 10% equity price decline and an estimated positive net impact to pretax income of $89 million related to a 100 basis point increase in interest rates as of December 31, 2014. The change in interest rate exposure since December 31, 2014 is primarily the result of adding new interest rate derivatives to the macro hedge program during 2015 and subsequent changes in market rates. Net impacts shown in the above table from GMWB and GMAB riders result largely from differences between the liability valuation basis and the hedging basis. Liabilities are valued using fair value accounting principles, with risk margins incorporated in contractholder behavior assumptions and with discount rates increased to reflect a current market estimate of our risk of nonperformance specific to these liabilities. The nonperformance spread risk is not hedged.Actual results could differ materially from those illustrated above as they are based on a number of estimates and assumptions. These include assuming that implied market volatility does not change when equity prices fall by 10%, that management does not increase assumed equity asset growth rates to anticipate recovery of the drop in equity values when valuing DAC, DSIC and GMDB and GMIB liability values and that the 100 basis point increase in interest rates is a parallel shift of the yield curve. Furthermore, we have not tried to anticipate changes in client preferences for different types of assets or other changes in client behavior, nor have we tried to anticipate actions management might take to increase revenues or reduce expenses in these scenarios.The selection of a 100 basis point interest rate increase as well as a 10% equity price decline should not be construed as a prediction of future market events. Impacts of larger or smaller changes in interest rates or equity prices may not be proportional to those shown for a 100 basis point increase in interest rates or a 10% decline in equity prices.88AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. Fair Value MeasurementsWe report certain assets and liabilities at fair value; specifically, separate account assets, derivatives, embedded derivatives, properties held by our consolidated property funds, and most investments and cash equivalents. Fair value assumes the exchange of assets or liabilities occurs in orderly transactions and is not the result of a forced liquidation or distressed sale. We include actual market prices, or observable inputs, in our fair value measurements to the extent available. Broker quotes are obtained when quotes from pricing services are not available. We validate prices obtained from third parties through a variety of means such as: price variance analysis, subsequent sales testing, stale price review, price comparison across pricing vendors and due diligence reviews of vendors. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our fair value measurements.Fair Value of Liabilities and Nonperformance RiskCompanies are required to measure the fair value of liabilities at the price that would be received to transfer the liability to a market participant (an exit price). Since there is not a market for the obligations of our variable annuity riders and indexed universal life insurance, we consider the assumptions participants in a hypothetical market would make to reflect an exit price. As a result, we adjust the valuation of variable annuity riders and indexed universal life insurance by updating certain contractholder assumptions, adding explicit margins to provide for profit, risk and expenses, and adjusting the rates used to discount expected cash flows to reflect a current market estimate of our nonperformance risk. The nonperformance risk adjustment is based on broker quotes for credit default swaps that are adjusted to estimate the risk of our life insurance company subsidiaries not fulfilling these liabilities. Consistent with general market conditions, this estimate resulted in a spread over the LIBOR swap curve as of June 30, 2015. As our estimate of this spread widens or tightens, the liability will decrease or increase. If this nonperformance credit spread moves to a zero spread over the LIBOR swap curve, the reduction to net income would be approximately $154 million, net of DAC, DSIC, unearned revenue amortization, the reinsurance accrual and income taxes (calculated at the statutory tax rate of 35%), based on June 30, 2015 credit spreads. Liquidity and Capital Resources OverviewWe maintained substantial liquidity during the six months ended June 30, 2015. At both June 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, we had $2.6 billion in cash and cash equivalents. We have additional liquidity available through an unsecured revolving credit facility for up to $500 million. Under the terms of the underlying credit agreement, we can increase this facility to $750 million upon satisfaction of certain approval requirements. Available borrowings under this facility are reduced by any outstanding letters of credit. At June 30, 2015, we had no outstanding borrowings under this credit facility and had $1 million of outstanding letters of credit. On May 1, 2015, we amended the underlying credit agreement for the facility to extend the expiration to May 2020. Our junior subordinated notes due 2066 and credit facility contain various administrative, reporting, legal and financial covenants. We were in compliance with all such covenants at June 30, 2015. We intend to use cash on hand to fund the repayment of $350 million of our senior notes due in November 2015.We enter into short-term borrowings, which may include repurchase agreements and Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) advances, to reduce reinvestment risk from higher levels of expected annuity net cash flows. Short-term borrowings allow us to receive cash to reinvest in longer-duration assets, while paying back the short-term debt with cash flows generated by the fixed income portfolio. The balance of repurchase agreements at both June 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014 was $50 million, which is collateralized with agency residential mortgage backed securities and commercial mortgage backed securities from our investment portfolio. Our subsidiary, RiverSource Life Insurance Company (“RiverSource Life”), is a member of the FHLB of Des Moines, which provides access to collateralized borrowings. As of both June 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, we had $150 million of borrowings from the FHLB, which is collateralized with commercial mortgage backed securities. We believe cash flows from operating activities, available cash balances and our availability of revolver borrowings will be sufficient to fund our operating liquidity needs.Dividends from SubsidiariesAmeriprise Financial is primarily a parent holding company for the operations carried out by our wholly owned subsidiaries. Because of our holding company structure, our ability to meet our cash requirements, including the payment of dividends on our common stock, substantially depends upon the receipt of dividends or return of capital from our subsidiaries, particularly our life insurance subsidiary, RiverSource Life, our face-amount certificate subsidiary, Ameriprise Certificate Company (“ACC”), AMPF Holding Corporation, which is the parent company of our retail introducing broker-dealer subsidiary, Ameriprise Financial Services, Inc. (“AFSI”) and our clearing broker-dealer subsidiary, American Enterprise Investment Services, Inc. (“AEIS”), our Auto and Home insurance subsidiary, IDS Property Casualty Insurance Company (“IDS Property Casualty”), doing business as Ameriprise Auto & Home Insurance, our transfer agent subsidiary, Columbia Management Investment Services Corp., our investment advisory company, Columbia Management Investment Advisers, LLC, and Threadneedle. The payment of dividends by many of our subsidiaries is restricted and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to regulatory capital requirements.89AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. Actual capital and regulatory capital requirements for our wholly owned subsidiaries subject to regulatory capital requirements were as follows:  Actual Capital Regulatory Capital Requirements June 30,  2015 December 31,  2014 June 30,  2015 December 31,  2014 (in millions)RiverSource Life(1)(2)$3,319 $3,614 N/A $595RiverSource Life of NY(1)(2)294 312 N/A 59IDS Property Casualty(1)(3)727 560 $208 200Ameriprise Insurance Company(1)(3)45 45 2 2ACC(4)(5)250 248 233 226Threadneedle(6)372 221 182 199Ameriprise National Trust Bank(7)38 21 10 10AFSI(3)(4)120 93 # #Ameriprise Captive Insurance Company(3)64 61 13 10Ameriprise Trust Company(3)27 26 24 24AEIS(3)(4)118 117 49 49RiverSource Distributors, Inc.(3)(4)14 13 # #Columbia Management Investment Distributors, Inc.(3)(4)18 18 # #N/A Not applicable.# Amounts are less than $1 million.(1) Actual capital is determined on a statutory basis.(2) Regulatory capital requirement is based on the statutory risk-based capital filing.(3) Regulatory capital requirement is based on the applicable regulatory requirement, calculated as of June 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014.(4) Actual capital is determined on an adjusted GAAP basis.(5) ACC is required to hold capital in compliance with the Minnesota Department of Commerce and SEC capital requirements.(6) Actual capital and regulatory capital requirements are determined in accordance with U.K. regulatory legislation.

During the six months ended June 30, 2014, the parent holding company received cash dividends or a return of capital from its subsidiaries of $725 million (including $300 million from RiverSource Life) and contributed cash to its subsidiaries of $6 million.Dividends Paid to Shareholders and Share Repurchases We paid regular quarterly dividends to our shareholders totaling $234 million and $215 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively. On July 22, 2015, we announced a quarterly dividend of $0.67 per common share. The dividend will be paid on August 14, 2015 to our shareholders of record at the close of business on August 3, 2015.In April 2014, our Board of Directors authorized an expenditure of up to $2.5 billion for the repurchase of shares of our common stock through April 28, 2016. As of June 30, 2015, the Company had $1.0 billion remaining under its share repurchase authorization. We intend to fund share repurchases through existing working capital, future earnings and other customary financing methods. The share repurchase programs do not require the purchase of any minimum number of shares, and depending on market conditions and other factors, these purchases may be commenced or suspended at any time without prior notice. Acquisitions under the share repurchase programs may be made in the open market, through privately negotiated transactions or block trades or other means. During the six months ended June 30, 2015, we repurchased a total of 6.0 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $129.48 per share.90AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. Cash Flows Cash flows of CIEs are reflected in our cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities, investing activities and financing activities. Cash held by CIEs is not available for general use by Ameriprise Financial, nor is Ameriprise Financial cash available for general use by its CIEs. As such, the operating, investing and financing cash flows of the CIEs have no impact to the change in cash and cash equivalents.Operating ActivitiesNet cash provided by operating activities increased $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2015 compared to $364 million for the prior year period primarily due to changes in restricted and segregated cash and investments, changes in cash held by CIEs, changes in investment properties of CIEs reflecting lower purchases and higher sales of investment properties, changes in other investments primarily related to trading securities, and a $145 million reduction of income taxes paid, net. Investing ActivitiesOur investing activities primarily relate to our Available-for-Sale investment portfolio. Further, this activity is significantly affected by the net flows of our investment certificate, fixed annuity and universal life products reflected in financing activities.Net cash used by investing activities was $182 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015 compared to net cash provided by investing activities of $158 million for the prior year period primarily reflecting a $716 million increase in purchases of Available-for Sale securities, partially offset by a $291 million increase in proceeds from sales and maturities, sinking fund payments and calls of Available-for-Sale securities and an $83 million reduction in cash outflows related to purchases of other investments.Financing ActivitiesNet cash used in financing activities increased $394 million to $1.4 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2015 compared to $1.0 billion for the prior year period. Cash outflows from policyholder account balances increased $233 million compared to the prior year period primarily due to higher surrenders and other benefits reflecting higher lapse rates. Cash inflows related to changes in debt of CIEs decreased $372 million compared to the prior year period due to $786 million in lower borrowings and $414 million in lower repayments of debt. Cash outflows related to distributions to noncontrolling interests increased $156 million. Net cash outflows from changes in short-term borrowings and debt repayments were nil in the first half of 2015 compared to $501 million for the prior year period as we reduced our borrowings from the FHLB and redeemed $200 million of our senior notes due 2039 during the six months ended June 30, 2014.
