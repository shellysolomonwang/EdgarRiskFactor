Item 1A Risk Factors” in our 2012 10-K and other factors as discussed herein.   Equity price, credit market and interest rate fluctuations can have a significant impact on our results of operations, primarily due to the effects they have on the asset management and other asset-based fees we earn, the “spread” income generated on our annuities, deposit products and universal life (“UL”) insurance products, the value of deferred acquisition costs (“DAC”) and deferred sales inducement costs (“DSIC”) assets, the values of liabilities for guaranteed benefits associated with our variable annuities and the values of derivatives held to hedge these benefits.   Earnings, as well as operating earnings, will continue to be negatively impacted by the ongoing low interest rate environment. In addition to continuing spread compression in our interest sensitive product lines, there is also the potential for interest rate related impacts to DAC and DSIC amortization and the level of reserves as a result of our ongoing review of various actuarial related assumptions, which could be material.   In January 2013, we completed the conversion of our federal savings bank subsidiary, Ameriprise Bank, FSB, to a limited powers national trust bank, which conversion included changing the name of this subsidiary to Ameriprise National Trust Bank (references herein to “Ameriprise Bank” pertain to this same subsidiary whether before or after its conversion). In connection with this conversion, deposit-taking and credit-originating activities of Ameriprise Bank were terminated. In addition, Ameriprise Financial was deregistered by the Federal Reserve as a savings and loan holding company and will no longer be subject to supervision and regulation as such. We will continue to make available to our clients certain deposit and credit products via referral arrangements with respected third party financial institutions. The transition released approximately $375 million of formerly required capital, which we anticipate using to repurchase shares throughout 2013. We estimate that the transition will reduce our annual earnings by approximately $60 million in 2013. At the enterprise level, we anticipate that the earnings per share impact will be neutralized by the end of 2013, as we redeploy the excess capital to shareholders through share repurchases.   We consolidate certain collateralized debt obligations (“CDOs”) and other investment products (collectively, “investment entities”) for which we provide asset management services to and sponsor for the investment of client assets in the normal course of business. These entities are defined as consolidated investment entities (“CIEs”). For further information on CIEs, see Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Changes in the valuation of the CIE assets and liabilities impact pretax income. The net income (loss) of the CIEs is reflected in net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests. The results of operations of the CIEs are reflected in the Corporate & Other segment. On a consolidated basis, the management fees we earn for the services we provide to the CIEs and the related general and administrative expenses are eliminated and the changes in the assets and liabilities related to the CIEs, primarily debt and underlying syndicated loans, are reflected in net investment income. We continue to include the fees in the management and financial advice fees line within our Asset Management segment.   49      Table of Contents   While our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), management believes that operating measures, which exclude net realized gains or losses; the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits, net of hedges and the related DSIC and DAC amortization; the market impact on indexed universal life benefits, net of hedges and the related DAC amortization, unearned revenue amortization and the reinsurance accrual; integration and restructuring charges; income (loss) from discontinued operations; and the impact of consolidating CIEs, best reflect the underlying performance of our core operations and facilitate a more meaningful trend analysis. While the consolidation of the CIEs impacts our balance sheet and income statement, our exposure to these entities is unchanged and there is no impact to the underlying business results. Management uses certain of these non-GAAP measures to evaluate our financial performance on a basis comparable to that used by some securities analysts and investors. Also, certain of these non-GAAP measures are taken into consideration, to varying degrees, for purposes of business planning and analysis and for certain compensation-related matters. Throughout our Management’s Discussion and Analysis, these non-GAAP measures are referred to as operating measures.   It is management’s priority to increase shareholder value over a multi-year horizon by achieving our on-average, over-time financial targets.   Our financial targets are:   · Operating total net revenue growth of 6% to 8%,   · Operating earnings per diluted share growth of 12% to 15%, and   · Operating return on equity excluding accumulated other comprehensive income of 15% to 18%.   The following tables reconcile our GAAP measures to operating measures:              Three Months Ended June 30,       Six Months Ended June 30,                 2013       2012       2013       2012                 (in millions)       (in millions)         Total net revenues       $   2,749       $   2,514       $   5,440       $   5,075         Less: Revenue attributable to the CIEs       12       1       94       53         Less: Net realized gains (losses)       —       (5   )   1       (7   )     Less: Market impact on indexed universal life benefits       (1   )   —       (1   )   —         Operating total net revenues       $   2,738       $   2,518       $   5,346       $   5,029                                     Per Diluted Share                 Three Months Ended June 30,       Three Months Ended June 30,                 2013       2012       2013       2012                 (in millions, except per share amounts)         Net income       $   281       $   170                         Less: Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests       (40   )   (53   )                     Net income attributable to Ameriprise Financial       321       223       $   1.54       $   0.99         Less: Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax       (1   )   (1   )   —       —         Net income from continuing operations attributable to Ameriprise Financial       322       224       1.54       0.99         Add: Integration/restructuring charges, net of tax (1)       1       17       0.01       0.08         Add: Market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits, net of tax (1)       28       9       0.13       0.04         Add: Market impact on indexed universal life benefits, net of tax (1)       1       —       0.01       —         Less: Net realized losses, net of tax (1)       —       (4   )   —       (0.02   )     Operating earnings       $   352       $   254       $   1.69       $   1.13                                                   Weighted average common shares outstanding:                                         Basic       204.9       221.7                         Diluted       208.6       225.6                           (1) Calculated using the statutory tax rate of 35%.   50      Table of Contents                              Per Diluted Share                 Six Months Ended June 30,       Six Months Ended June 30,                 2013       2012       2013       2012                 (in millions, except per share amounts)         Net income       $   646       $   418                         Less: Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests       (10   )   (49   )                     Net income attributable to Ameriprise Financial       656       467       $   3.12       $   2.04         Less: Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax       (2   )   (2   )   (0.01   )   (0.01   )     Net income from continuing operations attributable to Ameriprise Financial       658       469       3.13       2.05         Add: Integration/restructuring charges, net of tax (1)       2       32       0.01       0.14         Add: Market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits, net of tax (1)       30       83       0.14       0.36         Add: Market impact on indexed universal life benefits, net of tax (1)       1       —       —       —         Less: Net realized gains (losses), net of tax (1)       1       (5   )   —       (0.03   )     Operating earnings       $   690       $   589       $   3.28       $   2.58                                                   Weighted average common shares outstanding:                                         Basic       206.6       224.5                         Diluted       210.4       228.6                           (1) Calculated using the statutory tax rate of 35%.

Certain of our accounting and reporting policies are critical to an understanding of our consolidated results of operations and financial condition and, in some cases, the application of these policies can be significantly affected by the estimates, judgments and assumptions made by management during the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements. These accounting policies are discussed in detail in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis — Critical Accounting Policies” in our 2012 10-K.   Recent Accounting Pronouncements   For information regarding recent accounting pronouncements and their expected impact on our future consolidated results of operations and financial condition, see Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.   Assets Under Management and Administration   Assets under management (“AUM”) include external client assets for which we provide investment management services, such as the assets of the Columbia funds and Threadneedle funds, assets of institutional clients and assets of clients in our advisor platform held in wrap accounts as well as assets managed by sub-advisers selected by us. AUM also includes certain assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets for which we provide investment management services and recognize management fees in our Asset Management segment, such as the assets of the general account and the variable product funds held in the separate accounts of our life insurance subsidiaries and client assets of CIEs. These assets do not include assets under advisement, for which we provide model portfolios but do not have full discretionary investment authority. Corporate & Other AUM primarily includes former bank assets that are managed within our Corporate & Other segment.   Assets under administration (“AUA”) include assets for which we provide administrative services such as client assets invested in other companies’ products that we offer outside of our wrap accounts. These assets include those held in clients’ brokerage accounts. We generally record revenues received from administered assets as distribution fees. We do not exercise management discretion over these assets and do not earn a management fee. These assets are not reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. AUA also includes certain assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets for which we do not provide investment management services and do not recognize management fees, such as investments in non-affiliated funds held in the separate accounts of our life insurance subsidiaries. These assets do not include assets under advisement, for which we provide model portfolios but do not have full discretionary investment authority.   The following table presents detail regarding our AUM and AUA:              June 30,                                 2013       2012       Change                 (in billions)         Assets Under Management and Administration                                         Advice & Wealth Management AUM       $   136.3       $   114.7       $   21.6       19   %     Asset Management AUM       459.4       445.8       13.6       3         Corporate & Other AUM       1.0       —       1.0       NM         Eliminations       (19.0   )   (16.9   )   (2.1   )   (12   )     Total Assets Under Management       577.7       543.6       34.1       6         Total Assets Under Administration       125.5       111.2       14.3       13         Total AUM and AUA       $   703.2       $   654.8       $   48.4       7   %      Total AUM increased $34.1 billion, or 6%, to $577.7 billion as of June 30, 2013 compared to the prior year period due to a $21.6 billion increase in Advice & Wealth Management AUM driven by wrap account net inflows and market appreciation and a $13.6 billion increase in Asset Management AUM driven by market appreciation, partially offset by net outflows and a negative impact from foreign currency translation.

The market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits (net of hedges and the related DSIC and DAC amortization) was an expense of $43 million for the second quarter of 2013 compared to an expense of $16 million for the prior year period. The negative impact of the low interest rate environment was approximately $36 million pretax for the three months ended June 30, 2013 compared to the prior year period. Results for the prior year period included a $40 million unfavorable impact from a tax-related item primarily related to an out-of-period correction in the second quarter of 2012.   Net Revenues   Net revenues increased $235 million, or 9%, compared to the prior year period primarily due to higher management and financial advice fees and distribution fees.   Management and financial advice fees increased $142 million, or 12%, compared to the prior year period primarily due to higher asset-based fees driven by an increase in average AUM, as well as revenue enhancements related to various pricing adjustments. Average AUM increased $26.6 billion, or 5%, compared to the prior year period primarily due to market appreciation and wrap account net inflows, partially offset by asset management net outflows. See our discussion on the changes in AUM in our segment results of operations section below.   Distribution fees increased $52 million, or 13%, compared to the prior year period due to higher client assets and increased client activity.   Net investment income decreased $21 million, or 4%, compared to the prior year period reflecting a $51 million decrease in investment income on fixed maturity securities, partially offset by a $30 million gain on the sale of Threadneedle’s investment in Cofunds. The decrease in investment income on fixed maturity securities was primarily due to low interest    53      Table of Contents   rates and approximately $33 million of lower net investment income due to the sale of Ameriprise Bank’s investment portfolio as a result of the transition of banking operations in the fourth quarter of 2012.   Other revenues increased $47 million, or 23%, compared to the prior year period due to a $37 million increase in other revenues of CIEs and higher fees from variable annuity guarantees driven by higher volumes, as well as higher fee rates, partially offset by the absence of $5 million of other revenues from former banking operations.   Expenses   Total expenses increased $132 million, or 6%, compared to the prior year period due to an increase in distribution expenses and benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses.   Distribution expenses increased $97 million, or 15%, compared to the prior year period driven by growth in assets under management. See our discussion on the changes in AUM in our segment results of operations section below.   Interest credited to fixed accounts decreased $11 million, or 5%, compared to the prior year period driven by lower average fixed annuity account balances. Average fixed annuities contract accumulation values decreased $512 million, or 4%, to $13.6 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2013 compared to the prior year period due to net outflows. Fixed annuities remain in net outflows due to low client demand given the interest rate environment.   Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses increased $81 million, or 20%, compared to the prior year period primarily due to the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits (net of hedges and the related DSIC amortization), which was an expense of $51 million in the second quarter of 2013 compared to an expense of $11 million in the second quarter of 2012, as well as higher reserve funding related to higher fees from variable annuity guarantees, an increase in reserves related to our auto and home business driven by growth in exposure due to higher sales, higher reserves associated with unlocking of interest rate assumptions in the third quarter of 2012, an $8 million increase in disability income reserves in the second quarter of 2013 related to prior periods and a $9 million benefit from a life insurance reserve release in the prior year period, partially offset by a $12 million expense from fixed annuity valuation model adjustments in the prior year period.   Amortization of DAC decreased $7 million, or 7%, compared to the prior year period due to the DAC offset to the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits (net of hedges and the related DSIC amortization), partially offset by higher variable annuity DAC amortization associated with unlocking of interest rate assumptions in the third quarter of 2012. The DAC offset to the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits (net of hedges and the related DSIC amortization) was a benefit of $8 million in the second quarter of 2013 compared to an expense of $5 million in the second quarter of 2012.   Interest and debt expense decreased $12 million, or 17%, compared to the prior year period due to a decrease in interest expense on CIE debt.   General and administrative expense decreased $16 million, or 2%, compared to the prior year period primarily due to a $25 million decrease in integration and restructuring charges, $11 million in lower expenses associated with the completion of the brokerage platform conversion, $16 million of lower bank-related expenses and lower expenses from re-engineering efforts, partially offset by an $11 million increase in expenses of CIEs, higher compensation related accruals and higher expenses from investments in the business.   Income Taxes   Our effective tax rate on income from continuing operations including income attributable to noncontrolling interests was 29.6% for the three months ended June 30, 2013 compared to 42.8% for the prior year period. Our effective tax rate on income from continuing operations excluding income attributable to noncontrolling interests was 26.9% for the three months ended June 30, 2013 compared to 36.4% for the prior year period. The effective tax rate for the three months ended June 30, 2013 was lower than the statutory rate as a result of tax preferred items including the dividends received deduction, foreign tax credits and low income housing credits. The decrease in the effective tax rate for the three months ended June 30, 2013 compared to the prior year period is primarily the result of a $32 million correction of tax related to securities lending activities in the prior year period. During the second quarter of 2012, we discovered we had received incomplete data from a third-party service provider for securities lending activities that resulted in the miscalculation of our dividend received deduction and foreign tax credit, which resulted in an understatement of taxes payable and an overstatement of reported earnings in prior periods.   It is possible there will be corporate tax reform in the next few years. While impossible to predict, corporate tax reform is likely to include a reduction in the corporate tax rate coupled with reductions in tax preferred items. Potential tax reform may also affect the U.S. tax rules regarding international operations. Any changes could have a material impact on our income tax expense and deferred tax balances.   54      Table of Contents   Results of Operations by Segment for the Three Months Ended June 30, 2013 and 2012   Operating earnings is the measure of segment profit or loss management uses to evaluate segment performance. Operating earnings should not be viewed as a substitute for GAAP income from continuing operations before income tax provision. We believe the presentation of segment operating earnings as we measure it for management purposes enhances the understanding of our business by reflecting the underlying performance of our core operations and facilitating a more meaningful trend analysis. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the presentation of segment results and our definition of operating earnings.   The following table presents summary financial information by segment:              Three Months Ended June 30,                 2013       2012                 (in millions)         Advice & Wealth Management                         Net revenues       $   1,076       $   953         Expenses       924       842         Operating earnings       $   152       $   111         Asset Management                         Net revenues       $   822       $   707         Expenses       623       577         Operating earnings       $   199       $   130         Annuities                         Net revenues       $   641       $   628         Expenses       517       512         Operating earnings       $   124       $   116         Protection                         Net revenues       $   551       $   528         Expenses       453       419         Operating earnings       $   98       $   109         Corporate & Other                         Net revenues       $   (4   )   $   7         Expenses       81       74         Operating loss       $   (85   )   $   (67   )      Advice & Wealth Management   Our Advice & Wealth Management segment provides financial planning and advice, as well as full-service brokerage services, primarily to retail clients through our advisors. Our advisors have access to a diversified selection of both affiliated and non-affiliated products to help clients meet their financial needs. A significant portion of revenues in this segment is fee-based, driven by the level of client assets, which is impacted by both market movements and net asset flows. We also earn net investment income on invested assets primarily from certificate products. This segment earns revenues (distribution fees) for distributing non-affiliated products and earns intersegment revenues (distribution fees) for distributing our affiliated products and services to our retail clients. Intersegment expenses for this segment include expenses for investment management services provided by the Asset Management segment.   In addition to purchases of affiliated and non-affiliated mutual funds and other securities on a stand-alone basis, clients may purchase mutual funds, among other securities, in connection with investment advisory fee-based “wrap account” programs or services, and pay fees based on a percentage of their assets.   In January 2013, we completed the conversion of our federal savings bank subsidiary, Ameriprise Bank to a limited powers national trust bank. In 2012, all checking, savings and money market accounts and certificates of deposit were liquidated and returned to our clients, Ameriprise Bank’s consumer loan portfolio, including first mortgages, home equity loans, home equity lines of credit and unsecured loans, was sold to affiliates of Ameriprise Bank, and Ameriprise Bank’s credit card account portfolio was sold to Barclays Bank Delaware (“Barclays”). See additional discussion on the transition and the impact to our business in the Overview section above.   55      Table of Contents   The following table presents the changes in wrap account assets for the three months ended June 30:              2013       2012                 (in billions)         Beginning balance       $   133.8       $   113.1         Net flows       3.1       2.6         Market depreciation and other       (1.0   )   (2.3   )     Ending balance       $   135.9       $   113.4                                   Average balance (1)       $   134.8       $   113.3           (1) Average ending balances are calculated using a simple average of two quarters of data.   Wrap account assets increased $2.1 billion, or 2%, during the three months ended June 30, 2013 due to net inflows of $3.1 billion, partially offset by market depreciation and other of $1.0 billion. Wrap account net inflows increased $0.5 billion, or 19%, compared to the prior year period reflecting higher advisor productivity and investor confidence. Average wrap account assets increased $21.5 billion, or 19%, compared to the prior year period due to net inflows and market appreciation.

The negative impact of low interest rates was $15 million compared to the prior year period. We expect there will continue to be earnings pressure from low short-term interest rates during the balance of the year. Pretax operating earnings for the three months ended June 30, 2012 included $18 million of earnings from former banking operations. Pretax operating margin was 14.1% for the three months ended June 30, 2013 compared to 11.6% for the prior year period.   Net Revenues   Net revenues exclude net realized gains or losses. Net revenues increased $123 million, or 13%, to $1.1 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2013 compared to $953 million for the prior year period reflecting retail client net inflows, market appreciation and increased client activity, partially offset by lower net revenues due to the transition of    56      Table of Contents   banking operations in the fourth quarter of 2012 and the negative impact of low interest rates. Net revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2012 included $34 million from former banking operations. Operating net revenue per branded advisor was $110,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2013, up 13% from the prior year period. Total branded advisors were 9,788 at June 30, 2013 compared to 9,803 at June 30, 2012.   Management and financial advice fees increased $75 million, or 17%, to $505 million for the three months ended June 30, 2013 compared to $430 million for the prior year period driven by growth in wrap account assets. Average wrap account assets increased $21.5 billion, or 19%, to $134.8 billion at June 30, 2013 compared to the prior year period due to net inflows and market appreciation. See our discussion of the changes in wrap account assets above.   Distribution fees increased $81 million, or 18%, to $535 million for the three months ended June 30, 2013 compared to $454 million for the prior year period primarily due to higher client assets and increased client activity.   Net investment income decreased $33 million, or 52%, to $31 million for the three months ended June 30, 2013 compared to $64 million for the prior year period primarily due to the transition of banking operations in the fourth quarter of 2012, as well as a lower asset earnings rate on invested assets, partially offset by higher average certificate investment balances. Net investment income of former banking operations was $33 million for the three months ended June 30, 2012.   Expenses   Total expenses increased $82 million, or 10%, to $924 million for the three months ended June 30, 2013 compared to $842 million for the prior year period due to a $98 million increase in distribution expenses driven by higher compensation due to strong growth in client assets, partially offset by a $16 million decrease in general and administrative expense primarily due to the transition of banking operations in the fourth quarter of 2012 and $11 million of lower expenses associated with the completion of the brokerage platform conversion, partially offset by higher performance-driven compensation accruals. General and administrative expense of former banking operations was $16 million for the three months ended June 30, 2012.   Asset Management   Our Asset Management segment provides investment advice and investment products to retail, high net worth and institutional clients. Such products and services are provided on a global scale through Columbia Management and Threadneedle. Columbia Management primarily provides U.S. domestic products and services and Threadneedle primarily provides international investment products and services. We provide clients with U.S. domestic individual products through unaffiliated third party financial institutions and through our Advice & Wealth Management segment, and we provide institutional products and services through our institutional sales force. International retail products are primarily distributed through third-party financial institutions and unaffiliated financial advisors. Individual products include mutual funds, exchange-traded funds and variable product funds underlying insurance and annuity separate accounts. Institutional asset management services are designed to meet specific client objectives and may involve a range of products, including those that focus on traditional asset classes, separately managed accounts, individually managed accounts, collateralized loan obligations, hedge funds, collective funds and property funds. Collateralized loan obligations and hedge funds are classified as alternative assets. Revenues in this segment are primarily earned as fees based on managed asset balances, which are impacted by market movements, net asset flows, asset allocation and product mix. We may also earn performance fees from certain accounts where investment performance meets or exceeds certain pre-identified targets. In addition to the products and services provided to third-party clients, management teams serving our Asset Management segment provide all intercompany asset management services for Ameriprise Financial subsidiaries. The fees for such services are reflected within the Asset Management segment results through intersegment transfer pricing. Intersegment expenses for this segment include distribution expenses for services provided by our Advice & Wealth Management, Annuities and Protection segments.   On April 30, 2010, we completed the acquisition of the long-term asset management business of the Columbia Management Group from Bank of America. The acquisition significantly enhanced the capabilities of the Asset Management segment by increasing its scale, broadening its retail and institutional distribution capabilities and strengthening and diversifying its lineup of retail and institutional products. The integration of the Columbia Management business, which was completed in the second quarter of 2012, involved organizational changes to our portfolio management and analytical teams and to our operational, compliance, sales and marketing support staffs. This integration also involved the streamlining of our U.S. domestic product offerings. As a result of the integration, we combined RiverSource Investments, our legacy U.S. asset management business, with Columbia Management, under the Columbia brand. Total U.S. retail assets and number of funds under the Columbia brand as of June 30, 2013 were $223.3 billion and 210 funds, respectively.   From time to time, fee waivers have been provided to the Columbia Money Market Funds (the “Funds”) by Columbia Management and certain other subsidiaries performing services for the Funds for the purposes of reducing the expenses    57      Table of Contents   charged to a Fund in a given period to maintain or improve a Fund’s net yield in that period. Our subsidiaries may enter into contractual arrangements with the Funds identifying the specific fees to be waived and/or expenses to be reimbursed, as well as the time period for which such waivers will apply. In aggregate, we voluntarily waived fees of $3 million for both the three months ended June 30, 2013 and 2012.   Threadneedle remains our primary international investment management platform. Threadneedle manages eight OEICs and two Societe d’Investissement A Capital Variable (“SICAV”) offering. The eight OEICs are Threadneedle Investment Funds ICVC (“TIF”), Threadneedle Specialist Investment Funds ICVC (“TSIF”), Threadneedle Focus Investment Funds (“TFIF”), Threadneedle Portfolio Advantage Funds (“TPAF”), Threadneedle Investment Funds ICVC II (“TIF II”), Threadneedle Investment Funds ICVC III (“TIF III”), Threadneedle Investment Funds ICVC IV (“TIF IV”) and Threadneedle Opportunity Investment Funds ICVC (“TOIF”). TIF, TSIF, TFIF, TPAF, TIF II, TIF III, TIF IV and TOIF are structured as umbrella companies with a total of 71 (33, 14, 1, 2, 6, 8, 6 and 1, respectively) subfunds covering the world’s bond and equity markets. The SICAVs are the Threadneedle (Lux) SICAV (“T(Lux)”) and the Columbia Threadneedle SICAV-SIF (“SIF”). T(Lux) and SIF are structured as umbrella companies with a total of 32 (30 and 2, respectively) sub funds covering the world’s bond, commodities and equity markets. In addition, Threadneedle manages 13 unit trusts, 10 of which invest into the OEICs, 10 property unit trusts and one property fund of funds.

In instances where a fund’s Class Z shares do not have a full one, three or five year track record, performance for an older share class of the same fund, typically Class A shares, is utilized for the period before Class Z shares were launched. No adjustments to the historical track records are made to account for differences in fund expenses between share classes of a fund.   Equal Weighted Rankings in Top 2 Quartiles: Counts the number of funds with above median ranking divided by the total number of funds. Asset size is not a factor.   Asset Weighted Rankings in Top 2 Quartiles: Sums the total assets of the funds with above median ranking (using Class Z and appended Class Z) divided by total assets of all funds. Funds with more assets will receive a greater share of the total percentage above or below median.   Aggregated data includes all Columbia branded mutual funds.

(2) Retail fund outflows in Q2 2012 include $1.2 billion due to a change in subadvisory relationship between Threadneedle and Columbia. These outflows are eliminated at the segment level.   Total segment AUM decreased $7.1 billion, or 2%, during the three months ended June 30, 2013. Total segment AUM net outflows were $2.1 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2013. Management expects, consistent with prior patterns of outflows, that outflows of primarily low margin assets directly or indirectly affiliated with Threadneedle and Columbia former parent companies will continue for the foreseeable future. The overall impact to segment results is difficult to quantify due to uncertain timing, volume and mix of the outflows.   Columbia managed assets decreased $6.1 billion, or 2%, during the three months ended June 30, 2013. Total Columbia net outflows were $2.5 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2013. Columbia retail funds decreased $4.2 billion, or 2%, during the three months ended June 30, 2013. Columbia retail net outflows of $1.6 billion in the second quarter of 2013 included outflows from a large distribution partner that continued to re-balance asset concentrations, continued outflows from a third party sub-advisor and outflows associated with a share class change in the Registered Investment Advisor (“RIA”) channel. Consistent with the industry, outflows in retail fixed income funds were elevated late in the second quarter of 2013. Columbia institutional AUM decreased $0.9 billion, or 1%, during the three months ended June 30, 2013 primarily due to net outflows of $0.6 billion primarily reflecting outflows in former parent influenced mandates and former parent affiliated distribution, some of which was low basis points, partially offset by $1.3 billion of new mandates funded in the quarter.   62      Table of Contents   Threadneedle managed assets decreased $0.7 billion, or 1%, during the three months ended June 30, 2013 due to market depreciation, partially offset by net inflows of $0.7 billion. Threadneedle retail funds increased $0.4 billion, or 1%, during the three months ended June 30, 2013 due to net inflows of $0.9 billion, partially offset by market depreciation. Threadneedle institutional AUM decreased $1.0 billion, or 1%, primarily due to market depreciation. Threadneedle institutional net outflows of $0.2 billion during the second quarter of 2013 primarily reflected $0.7 billion of outflows largely from legacy insurance assets, partially offset by approximately $0.4 billion in mandates funded in the quarter.

Our Asset Management segment pretax operating earnings, which exclude net realized gains or losses and integration charges, increased $69 million, or 53%, to $199 million for the three months ended June 30, 2013 compared to $130 million for the prior year period reflecting equity market appreciation, a $30 million gain on the sale of Threadneedle’s strategic business investment in Cofunds, a $19 million benefit from a CDO unwind, continued revenue enhancements related to various pricing adjustments and expense re-engineering, partially offset by the impact of net outflows.   Net Revenues   Net revenues increased $115 million, or 16%, to $822 million for the three months ended June 30, 2013 compared to $707 million for the prior year period driven by an increase in management and financial advice fees, as well as a $30 million gain on the sale of Threadneedle’s investment in Cofunds.   Management and financial advice fees increased $70 million, or 12%, to $662 million for the three months ended June 30, 2013 compared to $592 million for the prior year period primarily due to an increase in assets under management, as well as revenue enhancements related to various pricing adjustments and $17 million of performance-based incentive fees on a CDO unwind. Average assets under management increased 2% compared to the prior year period driven by equity market appreciation, partially offset by net outflows and the negative impact of foreign currency translation. See our discussion and tables above for more detail on the changes in assets under management.   Net investment income increased $39 million to $41 million for the three months ended June 30, 2013 compared to $2 million for the prior year period due to a $30 million gain on the sale of Threadneedle’s investment in Cofunds, as well as a $10 million residual gain on a CDO unwind.   Expenses   Total expenses, which exclude integration charges, increased $46 million, or 8%, to $623 million for the three months ended June 30, 2013 compared to $577 million for the prior year period due to a $29 million increase in distribution expenses driven by higher retail fund assets and an $18 million increase in general and administrative expense driven by higher performance-based compensation, including $8 million of higher compensation related to a CDO unwind, and investments in the business, partially offset by re-engineering benefits.   63      Table of Contents   Annuities   Our Annuities segment provides variable and fixed annuity products of RiverSource Life companies to individual clients. We provide our variable annuity products through our advisors, and fixed annuity products are provided through both affiliated and unaffiliated advisors and financial institutions. Revenues for our variable annuity products are primarily earned as fees based on underlying account balances, which are impacted by both market movements and net asset flows. Revenues for our fixed annuity products are primarily earned as net investment income on assets supporting fixed account balances, with profitability significantly impacted by the spread between net investment income earned and interest credited on the fixed account balances. We also earn net investment income on owned assets supporting reserves for immediate annuities and for certain guaranteed benefits offered with variable annuities and on capital supporting the business. Intersegment revenues for this segment reflect fees paid by our Asset Management segment for marketing support and other services provided in connection with the availability of variable insurance trust funds (“VIT Funds”) under the variable annuity contracts. Intersegment expenses for this segment include distribution expenses for services provided by our Advice & Wealth Management segment, as well as expenses for investment management services provided by our Asset Management segment.   The following table presents the results of operations of our Annuities segment on an operating basis:              Three Months Ended June 30,                                 2013       2012       Change                 (in millions)                 Revenues                                         Management and financial advice fees       $   174       $   159       $   15       9   %     Distribution fees       85       78       7       9         Net investment income       266       287       (21   )   (7   )     Premiums       26       28       (2   )   (7   )     Other revenues       90       76       14       18         Total revenues       641       628       13       2         Banking and deposit interest expense       —       —       —       —         Total net revenues       641       628       13       2         Expenses                                         Distribution expenses       109       97       12       12         Interest credited to fixed accounts       162       174       (12   )   (7   )     Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses       130       121       9       7         Amortization of deferred acquisition costs       66       57       9       16         General and administrative expense       50       63       (13   )   (21   )     Total expenses       517       512       5       1         Operating earnings       $   124       $   116       $   8       7   %      Our Annuities segment pretax operating income, which excludes net realized gains or losses and the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits (net of hedges and the related DSIC and DAC amortization), increased $8 million, or 7%, to $124 million for the three months ended June 30, 2013 compared to $116 million for the prior year period. Results for the second quarter of 2012 included an expense of $14 million from fixed annuity valuation model adjustments.   RiverSource variable annuity account balances increased 8% to $70.3 billion at June 30, 2013 compared to the prior year period driven by market appreciation. Variable annuity net outflows of $135 million for the second quarter of 2013 reflected the closed book of annuities previously sold through third parties, partially offset by $139 million of net inflows in the Ameriprise channel. RiverSource fixed annuity account balances declined 4% to $13.5 billion due to ongoing net outflows resulting from low client demand given the interest rate environment.   Net Revenues   Net revenues, which exclude net realized gains or losses, increased $13 million, or 2%, to $641 million for the three months ended June 30, 2013 compared to $628 million for the prior year period.   Management and financial advice fees increased $15 million, or 9%, to $174 million for the three months ended June 30, 2013 compared to $159 million for the prior year period due to higher fees on variable annuities driven by higher separate account balances. Average variable annuities contract accumulation values increased $6.2 billion, or 10%, from the prior year period primarily due to market appreciation.   64      Table of Contents   Distribution fees increased $7 million, or 9%, to $85 million for the three months ended June 30, 2013 compared to $78 million for the prior year period primarily due to higher fees on variable annuities driven by higher separate account balances.   Net investment income, which excludes net realized gains or losses, decreased $21 million, or 7%, to $266 million for the three months ended June 30, 2013 compared to $287 million for the prior year period due to a $25 million decrease in investment income on fixed maturities primarily reflecting a decrease of approximately $13 million from lower invested assets and approximately $9 million from lower interest rates.   Other revenues increased $14 million, or 18%, to $90 million for the three months ended June 30, 2013 compared to $76 million for the prior year period due to higher fees from variable annuity guarantees driven by higher volumes and higher fee rates.   Expenses   Total expenses, which exclude the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits (net of hedges and the related DSIC and DAC amortization) increased $5 million, or 1%, to $517 million for the three months ended June 30, 2013 compared to $512 million for the prior year period.   Distribution expenses increased $12 million, or 12%, to $109 million for the three months ended June 30, 2013 compared to $97 million for the prior year period primarily due to higher variable annuity compensation due to business growth and market appreciation.   Interest credited to fixed accounts decreased $12 million, or 7%, to $162 million for the three months ended June 30, 2013 compared to $174 million for the prior year period driven by lower average fixed annuity account balances. Average fixed annuities contract accumulation values decreased $512 million, or 4%, to $13.6 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2013 compared to the prior year period due to net outflows. Fixed annuities remain in net outflows due to low client demand given the interest rate environment.   Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses, which exclude the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits (net of hedges and the related DSIC amortization), increased $9 million, or 7%, to $130 million for the three months ended June 30, 2013 compared to $121 million for the prior year period primarily due to higher reserve funding related to higher fees from variable annuity guarantees and higher reserves associated with unlocking of interest rate assumptions in the third quarter of 2012, partially offset by an expense of $12 million from fixed annuity valuation model adjustments in the second quarter of 2012.   Amortization of DAC, which excludes the DAC offset to the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits, increased $9 million, or 16%, to $66 million for the three months ended June 30, 2013 compared to $57 million for the prior year period primarily due to higher variable annuity DAC amortization associated with unlocking of interest rate assumptions in the third quarter of 2012.   General and administrative expense decreased $13 million, or 21%, to $50 million for the three months ended June 30, 2013 compared to $63 million for the prior year period. In the second quarter of 2012, we recognized a net $6 million charge for estimated future assessments from state insurance guaranty funds, primarily associated with the liquidation of Executive Life Insurance Company of New York. See Note 15 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on insurance industry guaranty fund assessments.   65      Table of Contents   Protection   Our Protection segment offers a variety of products to address the protection and risk management needs of our retail clients including life, disability income and property-casualty insurance. Life and disability income products are primarily provided through our advisors. Our property-casualty products are sold primarily through affinity relationships. We issue insurance policies through our life insurance subsidiaries and the Property Casualty companies. The primary sources of revenues for this segment are premiums, fees and charges we receive to assume insurance-related risk. We earn net investment income on owned assets supporting insurance reserves and capital supporting the business. We also receive fees based on the level of assets supporting VUL separate account balances. This segment earns intersegment revenues from fees paid by our Asset Management segment for marketing support and other services provided in connection with the availability of VIT Funds under the VUL contracts. Intersegment expenses for this segment include distribution expenses for services provided by our Advice & Wealth Management segment, as well as expenses for investment management services provided by our Asset Management segment.   The following table presents the results of operations of our Protection segment on an operating basis:              Three Months Ended June 30,                                 2013       2012       Change                 (in millions)                 Revenues                                         Management and financial advice fees       $   14       $   13       $   1       8   %     Distribution fees       23       23       —       —         Net investment income       112       106       6       6         Premiums       293       278       15       5         Other revenues       109       108       1       1         Total revenues       551       528       23       4         Banking and deposit interest expense       —       —       —       —         Total net revenues       551       528       23       4         Expenses                                         Distribution expenses       20       18       2       11         Interest credited to fixed accounts       34       35       (1   )   (3   )     Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses       309       277       32       12         Amortization of deferred acquisition costs       31       32       (1   )   (3   )     General and administrative expense       59       57       2       4         Total expenses       453       419       34       8         Operating earnings       $   98       $   109       $   (11   )   (10   )%      Our Protection segment pretax operating income, which excludes net realized gains or losses and the market impact on indexed universal life benefits (net of hedges and the related DAC amortization, unearned revenue amortization and the reinsurance accrual), decreased $11 million, or 10%, to $98 million for the three months ended June 30, 2013 compared to $109 million for the prior year period reflecting life and health business growth that was more than offset by an $8 million disability income insurance reserve adjustment and lower auto and home earnings due to increased reserves.   Net Revenues   Net revenues, which exclude net realized gains or losses and the unearned revenue amortization and the reinsurance accrual offset to the market impact on indexed universal life benefits, increased $23 million, or 4%, to $551 million for the three months ended June 30, 2013 compared to $528 million for the prior year period primarily due to growth in auto and home premiums.   Net investment income, which excludes net realized gains or losses, increased $6 million, or 6%, to $112 million for the three months ended June 30, 2013 compared to $106 million for the prior year period due to an increase in investment income on fixed maturities.   Premiums increased $15 million, or 5%, to $293 million for the three months ended June 30, 2013 compared to $278 million for the prior year period primarily due to growth in auto and home premiums driven by continued strong new policy sales growth across market segments, primarily from our affinity relationships with Costco and Progressive. Auto and home policy counts increased 10% year-over-year.   66      Table of Contents   Expenses   Total expenses, which exclude the market impact on indexed universal life benefits (net of hedges and the related DAC amortization), increased $34 million, or 8%, to $453 million for the three months ended June 30, 2013 compared to $419 million for the prior year period due to an increase in benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses.   Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses, which exclude the market impact on indexed universal life benefits (net of hedges), increased $32 million, or 12%, to $309 million for the three months ended June 30, 2013 compared to $277 million for the prior year period due to an $8 million increase in disability income reserves in the second quarter of 2013 related to prior periods, higher expenses related to our auto and home business primarily due to growth in exposure due to higher sales and a $9 million benefit from a life insurance reserve release in the prior year period.   Corporate & Other   Our Corporate & Other segment consists of net investment income or loss on corporate level assets, including excess capital held in our subsidiaries and other unallocated equity and other revenues as well as unallocated corporate expenses. The Corporate & Other segment also includes revenues and expenses of CIEs, which are excluded on an operating basis.   The following table presents the results of operations of our Corporate & Other segment on an operating basis:              Three Months Ended June 30,                                 2013       2012       Change                 (in millions)                 Revenues                                         Distribution fees       $   1       $   —       $   1       NM         Net investment income (loss)       (5   )   4       (9   )   NM         Other revenues       —       3       (3   )   NM         Total revenues       (4   )   7       (11   )   NM         Banking and deposit interest expense       —       —       —       —         Total net revenues       (4   )   7       (11   )   NM         Expenses                                         Interest and debt expense       25       24       1       4   %     General and administrative expense       56       50       6       12         Total expenses       81       74       7       9         Operating loss       $   (85   )   $   (67   )   $   (18   )   (27   )%      NM Not Meaningful.   Our Corporate & Other segment pretax operating loss excludes net realized gains or losses, the impact of consolidating CIEs and restructuring charges. Our Corporate & Other segment pretax operating loss was $85 million for the three months ended June 30, 2013 compared to $67 million for the prior year period. Operating losses for the second quarter of 2013 included a loss of $10 million primarily due to how we offset accretion from an intercompany transfer of former bank assets. Approximately $8 million of this loss was reflected in net investment loss and approximately $2 million was reflected in general and administrative expense. The loss of $8 million in the Corporate & Other segment was offset by the associated incremental accretion income, primarily in the Annuities segment, that relates to the transfer of the bank assets and eliminates on a consolidated basis.   67      Table of Contents   Consolidated Results of Operations for the Six Months Ended June 30, 2013 and 2012   The following table presents our consolidated results of operations:              Six Months Ended June 30,                                 2013       2012       Change                 (in millions)         Revenues                                         Management and financial advice fees       $   2,538       $   2,284       $   254       11   %     Distribution fees       882       798       84       11         Net investment income       940       1,003       (63   )   (6   )     Premiums       625       603       22       4         Other revenues       471       408       63       15         Total revenues       5,456       5,096       360       7         Banking and deposit interest expense       16       21       (5   )   (24   )     Total net revenues       5,440       5,075       365       7         Expenses                                         Distribution expenses       1,486       1,329       157       12         Interest credited to fixed accounts       396       415       (19   )   (5   )     Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses       899       914       (15   )   (2   )     Amortization of deferred acquisition costs       167       130       37       28         Interest and debt expense       126       141       (15   )   (11   )     General and administrative expense       1,477       1,525       (48   )   (3   )     Total expenses       4,551       4,454       97       2         Income from continuing operations before income tax provision       889       621       268       43         Income tax provision       241       201       40       20         Income from continuing operations       648       420       228       54         Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax       (2   )   (2   )   —       —         Net income       646       418       228       55         Less: Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests       (10   )   (49   )   39       80         Net income attributable to Ameriprise Financial       $   656       $   467       $   189       40   %      Overall   Income from continuing operations before income tax provision increased $268 million, or 43%, compared to the prior year period primarily reflecting the impact of market appreciation, wrap account net inflows, the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits (net of hedges and the related DSIC and DAC amortization) and a $30 million gain on the sale of Threadneedle’s strategic business investment in Cofunds in the second quarter of 2013, partially offset by the negative impact of the low interest rate environment and asset management net outflows. The market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits (net of hedges and the related DSIC and DAC amortization) was an expense of $45 million for the six months ended June 30, 2013 compared to an expense of $129 million for the prior year period. The negative impact of the low interest rate environment was approximately $59 million pretax for the six months ended June 30, 2013 compared to the prior year period. Results for the prior year period included a $40 million unfavorable impact from a tax-related item primarily related to an out-of-period correction in the second quarter of 2012.   Net Revenues   Net revenues increased $365 million, or 7%, compared to the prior year period primarily due to higher management and financial advice fees and distribution fees.   Management and financial advice fees increased $254 million, or 11%, compared to the prior year period primarily due to higher asset-based fees driven by an increase in average AUM, as well as revenue enhancements related to various pricing adjustments. Average AUM increased $29.3 billion, or 5%, compared to the prior year period primarily due to market appreciation and wrap account net inflows, partially offset by asset management net outflows. See our discussion on the changes in AUM in our segment results of operations section below.   Distribution fees increased $84 million, or 11%, compared to the prior year period due to higher client assets and increased client activity.   Net investment income decreased $63 million, or 6%, compared to the prior year period reflecting a $107 million decrease in investment income on fixed maturity securities, partially offset by a $30 million gain on the sale of Threadneedle’s    68      Table of Contents   investment in Cofunds and a $9 million increase in net investment income of CIEs. The decrease in investment income on fixed maturity securities was primarily due to low interest rates and approximately $63 million of lower net investment income due to the sale of Ameriprise Bank’s investment portfolio as a result of the transition of banking operations in the fourth quarter of 2012.   Other revenues increased $63 million, or 15%, compared to the prior year period due to a $53 million increase in other revenues of CIEs and higher fees from variable annuity guarantees driven by higher volumes, as well as higher fee rates, partially offset by the absence of $10 million of other revenues from former banking operations.   Expenses   Total expenses increased $97 million, or 2%, compared to the prior year period primarily due to an increase in distribution expenses partially offset by a decrease in general and administrative expense.   Distribution expenses increased $157 million, or 12%, compared to the prior year period driven by growth in assets under management. See our discussion on the changes in AUM in our segment results of operations section below.   Interest credited to fixed accounts decreased $19 million, or 5%, compared to the prior year period driven by lower average fixed annuity account balances. Average fixed annuities contract accumulation values decreased $465 million, or 3%, to $13.7 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2013 compared to the prior year period due to net outflows. Fixed annuities remain in net outflows due to low client demand given the interest rate environment.   Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses decreased $15 million, or 2%, compared to the prior year period primarily due to the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits (net of hedges and the related DSIC amortization), which was an expense of $52 million for the six months ended June 30, 2013 compared to an expense of $160 million for the prior year period, partially offset by higher reserve funding related to higher fees from variable annuity guarantees, an increase in reserves related to our auto and home business driven by growth in exposure due to higher sales, higher reserves associated with unlocking of interest rate assumptions in the third quarter of 2012, an $8 million increase in disability income reserves in the second quarter of 2013 related to prior periods, a $9 million benefit from a life insurance reserve release in the prior year period and an $8 million benefit from valuation model adjustments in the prior year period.   Amortization of DAC increased $37 million, or 28%, compared to the prior year period primarily due to the DAC offset to the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits (net of hedges and the related DSIC amortization), as well as higher variable annuity DAC amortization associated with unlocking of interest rate assumptions in the third quarter of 2012. The DAC offset to the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits (net of hedges and the related DSIC amortization) was a benefit of $7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2013 compared to a benefit of $31 million in the prior year period. The market impact on DAC was a benefit of $3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2013 compared to a benefit of $11 million in the prior year period as a result of favorable equity market returns largely offset by unfavorable bond fund returns in the first half of 2013 compared to favorable equity and bond fund returns in the first half of 2012.   Interest and debt expense decreased $15 million, or 11%, compared to the prior year period due to a decrease in interest expense on CIE debt.   General and administrative expense decreased $48 million, or 3%, compared to the prior year period primarily due to a $46 million decrease in integration and restructuring charges, $19 million in lower expenses associated with the completion of the brokerage platform conversion, $33 million of lower bank-related expenses and lower expenses from re-engineering efforts, partially offset by a $20 million increase in expenses of CIEs, higher compensation related accruals and higher expenses from investments in the business.   Income Taxes   Our effective tax rate on income from continuing operations including income attributable to noncontrolling interests was 27.1% for the six months ended June 30, 2013 compared to 32.4% for the prior year period. Our effective tax rate on income from continuing operations excluding income attributable to noncontrolling interests was 26.8% for the six months ended June 30, 2013 compared to 30.0% for the prior year period. The effective tax rate for the six months ended June 30, 2013 was lower than the statutory rate as a result of tax preferred items including the dividends received deduction, foreign tax credits and low income housing credits. The decrease in the effective tax rate for the six months ended June 30, 2013 compared to the prior year period is primarily the result of a $32 million correction of tax related to securities lending activities in the prior year period.   69      Table of Contents   Results of Operations by Segment for the Six Months Ended June 30, 2013 and 2012   Operating earnings is the measure of segment profit or loss management uses to evaluate segment performance. Operating earnings should not be viewed as a substitute for GAAP income from continuing operations before income tax provision. We believe the presentation of segment operating earnings as we measure it for management purposes enhances the understanding of our business by reflecting the underlying performance of our core operations and facilitating a more meaningful trend analysis. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the presentation of segment results and our definition of operating earnings.

Wrap account assets increased $11.3 billion, or 9%, during the six months ended June 30, 2013 due to net inflows of $7.2 billion and market appreciation and other of $4.1 billion. Wrap account net inflows increased $1.7 billion, or 31%, compared to the prior year period reflecting higher advisor productivity and investor confidence. Average wrap account assets increased $21.4 billion, or 19%, compared to the prior year period due to net inflows and market appreciation.

The negative impact of low interest rates was $25 million compared to the prior year period. Pretax operating earnings for the six months ended June 30, 2012 included $33 million of earnings from former banking operations. Pretax operating margin was 13.5% for the six months ended June 30, 2013 compared to 10.7% for the prior year period.   Net Revenues   Net revenues exclude net realized gains or losses. Net revenues increased $187 million, or 10%, to $2.1 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2013 compared to $1.9 billion for the prior year period reflecting retail client net inflows, market appreciation and increased client activity, partially offset by lower net revenues due to the transition of banking operations in the fourth quarter of 2012 and the negative impact of low interest rates. Net revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2012 included $66 million from former banking operations. Operating net revenue per branded advisor was $214,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2013, up 10% from the prior year period. Total branded advisors were 9,788 at June 30, 2013 compared to 9,803 at June 30, 2012.   Management and financial advice fees increased $139 million, or 17%, to $981 million for the six months ended June 30, 2013 compared to $842 million for the prior year period driven by growth in wrap account assets. Average wrap account assets increased $21.4 billion, or 19%, to $131.4 billion at June 30, 2013 compared to the prior year period due to net inflows and market appreciation. See our discussion of the changes in wrap account assets above.   71      Table of Contents   Distribution fees increased $113 million, or 12%, to $1.0 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2013 compared to $925 million for the prior year period primarily due to higher client assets and increased client activity.   Net investment income decreased $65 million, or 51%, to $63 million for the six months ended June 30, 2013 compared to $128 million for the prior year period due to $63 million of lower net investment income due to the transition of banking operations in the fourth quarter of 2012, as well as a lower asset earnings rate on invested assets, partially offset by higher average certificate investment balances.   Expenses   Total expenses increased $109 million, or 6%, to $1.8 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2013 compared to $1.7 billion for the prior year period due to a $151 million increase in distribution expenses driven by higher compensation due to strong growth in client assets, partially offset by a $42 million decrease in general and administrative expense primarily due to $33 million of lower expenses from the transition of banking operations in the fourth quarter of 2012 and $19 million of lower expenses associated with the completion of the brokerage platform conversion, partially offset by higher performance-driven compensation accruals.   Asset Management   In aggregate, we voluntarily waived fees to the Funds of $6 million for both the six months ended June 30, 2013 and 2012.

(2) Retail fund outflows in Q2 2012 include $1.2 billion due to a change in subadvisory relationship between Threadneedle and Columbia. These outflows are eliminated at the segment level.    Total segment AUM increased $4.0 billion, or 1%, during the six months ended June 30, 2013 primarily due to market appreciation, partially offset by net outflows of $7.8 billion and the negative impact of foreign currency translation. Management expects, consistent with prior patterns of outflows, that outflows of primarily low margin assets directly or indirectly affiliated with Threadneedle and Columbia former parent companies will continue for the foreseeable future. The overall impact to segment results is difficult to quantify due to uncertain timing, volume and mix of the outflows.   Columbia managed assets increased $4.8 billion, or 1%, during the six months ended June 30, 2013 due to market appreciation, partially offset by net outflows of $7.6 billion. Columbia retail funds increased $7.0 billion, or 3%, during the six months ended June 30, 2013 due to market appreciation, partially offset by net outflows. Columbia retail net outflows of $3.4 billion in the first half of 2013 included outflows from a large distribution partner that continued to re-balance asset concentrations, continued outflows from a third party sub-advisor and outflows associated with a share class change in the RIA channel. Columbia institutional AUM decreased $1.3 billion, or 2%, during the six months ended June 30, 2013 due to net outflows, partially offset by market appreciation. Columbia institutional net outflows of $3.8 billion in the first half of 2013 primarily reflected outflows in former parent influenced mandates and former parent affiliated distribution, some of which was low basis points, as well as first quarter outflows in investment grade and high yield credit mandates given strong performance in these asset classes, partially offset by new mandates funded in the second quarter of 2013.   74      Table of Contents   Threadneedle managed assets decreased $0.8 billion, or 1%, during the six months ended June 30, 2013 primarily due to an $8.4 billion negative impact of foreign currency translation, partially offset by market appreciation. Threadneedle net outflows for the first half of 2013 were $0.2 billion. Threadneedle retail funds increased $2.7 billion, or 7%, during the six months ended June 30, 2013 due to market appreciation and net inflows of $2.3 billion, partially offset by the negative impact of foreign currency translation. Threadneedle retail fund net inflows in the first half of 2013 were driven by recovering consumer confidence and good sales in key areas such as Europe. Threadneedle institutional AUM decreased $3.3 billion, or 4%, due to net outflows and the negative impact of foreign currency translation, partially offset by market appreciation. Threadneedle institutional net outflows of $2.5 billion in the first half of 2013 primarily reflected $2.8 billion of outflows from legacy insurance assets, including $1.0 billion from a Japanese mandate, partially offset by new mandate funding and additional flows into existing funds.

Net Revenues   Net revenues increased $150 million, or 11%, to $1.6 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2013 compared to $1.4 billion for the prior year period driven by an increase in management and financial advice fees, as well as a $30 million gain on the sale of Threadneedle’s investment in Cofunds.   Management and financial advice fees increased $111 million, or 9%, to $1.3 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2013 compared to $1.2 billion for the prior year period primarily due to an increase in assets under management, as well as revenue enhancements related to various pricing adjustments and $17 million of performance based incentive fees on a CDO unwind. Average assets under management increased 3% compared to the prior year period driven by equity market appreciation, partially offset by net outflows and the negative impact of foreign currency translation. See our discussion above on the changes in assets under management.   Net investment income increased $38 million to $45 million for the six months ended June 30, 2013 compared to $7 million for the prior year period due to a $30 million gain on the sale of Threadneedle’s investment in Cofunds, as well as a $10 million residual gain on a CDO unwind.   Expenses   Total expenses, which exclude integration charges, increased $68 million, or 6%, to $1.2 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2013 compared to the prior year period primarily due to a $43 million increase in distribution expenses driven by higher retail fund assets and a $25 million increase in general and administrative expense driven by higher performance-   75      Table of Contents   based compensation, including $8 million of higher compensation related to a CDO unwind, and investments in the business, partially offset by re-engineering benefits.

Our Annuities segment pretax operating income, which excludes net realized gains or losses and the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits (net of hedges and the related DSIC and DAC amortization), decreased $25 million, or 8%, to $280 million for the six months ended June 30, 2013 compared to $305 million for the prior year period. The market impact on DAC and DSIC was a benefit of $2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2013 compared to a benefit of $13 million in the prior year period.   RiverSource variable annuity account balances increased 8% to $70.3 billion at June 30, 2013 compared to the prior year period driven by market appreciation. Variable annuity net outflows of $328 million for the first half of 2013 reflected the closed book of annuities previously sold through third parties, partially offset by $175 million of net inflows in the Ameriprise channel. RiverSource fixed annuity account balances declined 4% to $13.5 billion due to ongoing net outflows resulting from low client demand given the interest rate environment.   Net Revenues   Net revenues, which exclude net realized gains or losses, increased $15 million, or 1%, to $1.3 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2013 compared to the prior year period.   Management and financial advice fees increased $25 million, or 8%, to $344 million for the six months ended June 30, 2013 compared to $319 million for the prior year period due to higher fees on variable annuities driven by higher separate account balances. Average variable annuities contract accumulation values increased $5.3 billion, or 9%, from the prior year period primarily due to market appreciation.   Distribution fees increased $12 million, or 8%, to $166 million for the six months ended June 30, 2013 compared to $154 million for the prior year period primarily due to higher fees on variable annuities driven by higher separate account balances.   Net investment income, which excludes net realized gains or losses, decreased $44 million, or 8%, to $536 million for the six months ended June 30, 2013 compared to $580 million for the prior year period due to a $46 million decrease in investment income on fixed maturities primarily reflecting a decrease of approximately $27 million from lower invested assets and approximately $18 million from lower interest rates.   Premiums decreased $6 million, or 10%, to $54 million for the six months ended June 30, 2013 compared to $60 million for the prior year period due to lower sales of immediate annuities with life contingencies.   76      Table of Contents   Other revenues increased $28 million, or 20%, to $171 million for the six months ended June 30, 2013 compared to $143 million for the prior year period due to higher fees from variable annuity guarantees driven by higher volumes and higher fee rates.   Expenses   Total expenses, which exclude the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits (net of hedges and the related DSIC and DAC amortization) increased $40 million, or 4%, to $991 million for the six months ended June 30, 2013 compared to $951 million for the prior year period primarily due to an increase in benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses.   Distribution expenses increased $13 million, or 7%, to $210 million for the six months ended June 30, 2013 compared to $197 million for the prior year period primarily due to higher variable annuity compensation due to business growth and market appreciation.   Interest credited to fixed accounts decreased $19 million, or 6%, to $326 million for the six months ended June 30, 2013 compared to $345 million for the prior year period driven by lower average fixed annuity account balances. Average fixed annuities contract accumulation values decreased $465 million, or 3%, to $13.7 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2013 compared to the prior year period due to outflows. Fixed annuities remain in net outflows due to low client demand given the interest rate environment.   Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses, which exclude the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits (net of hedges and the related DSIC amortization), increased $47 million, or 24%, to $246 million for the six months ended June 30, 2013 compared to $199 million for the prior year period primarily due to higher reserve funding related to higher fees from variable annuity guarantees, higher reserves associated with unlocking of interest rate assumptions in the third quarter of 2012 and a benefit of $11 million from valuation model adjustments in the first half of 2012.   Amortization of DAC, which excludes the DAC offset to the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits, increased $16 million, or 18%, to $107 million for the six months ended June 30, 2013 compared to $91 million for the prior year period due to the market impact on DAC and higher variable annuity DAC amortization associated with unlocking of interest rate assumptions in the third quarter of 2012. The market impact on DAC was a benefit of $2 million in the first half of 2013 compared to a benefit of $10 million in the prior year period as a result of favorable equity market returns largely offset by unfavorable bond fund returns in the first half of 2013 compared to favorable equity and bond fund returns in the prior year period.

Net investment income, which excludes net realized gains or losses, increased $11 million, or 5%, to $223 million for the six months ended June 30, 2013 compared to $212 million for the prior year period due to an increase in investment income on fixed maturities.   Premiums increased $28 million, or 5%, to $579 million for the six months ended June 30, 2013 compared to $551 million for the prior year period primarily due to growth in auto and home premiums driven by continued strong new policy sales growth across market segments, primarily from our affinity relationships with Costco and Progressive. Auto and home policy counts increased 10% year-over-year.   Expenses   Total expenses, which exclude the market impact on indexed universal life benefits (net of hedges and the related DAC amortization), increased $47 million, or 6%, to $881 million for the six months ended June 30, 2013 compared to $834 million for the prior year period due to an increase in benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses.   Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses, which exclude the market impact on indexed universal life benefits (net of hedges), increased $46 million, or 8%, to $601 million for the six months ended June 30, 2013 compared to $555 million for the prior year period due to higher expenses related to our auto and home business primarily due to growth in exposure due to higher sales, an $8 million increase in disability income reserves in the second quarter of 2013 related to prior periods and a $9 million benefit from a life insurance reserve release in the prior year period.

Our Corporate & Other segment pretax operating loss excludes net realized gains or losses, the impact of consolidating CIEs and restructuring charges. Our Corporate & Other segment pretax operating loss was $166 million for the six months ended June 30, 2013 compared to $132 million for the prior year period. Operating losses for the first half of 2013 included a loss of $21 million primarily due to how we offset accretion from an intercompany transfer of former bank assets. Approximately $16 million of this loss was reflected in net investment loss and approximately $5 million was reflected in general and administrative expense. The loss of $16 million in the Corporate & Other segment was offset by the associated incremental accretion income, primarily in the Annuities segment, that relates to the transfer of the bank assets and eliminates on a consolidated basis.   78      Table of Contents   Market Risk   Our primary market risk exposures are interest rate, equity price, foreign currency exchange rate and credit risk. Equity price and interest rate fluctuations can have a significant impact on our results of operations, primarily due to the effects they have on the asset management and other asset-based fees we earn, the spread income generated on our annuities, brokerage client cash balances and face amount certificate products and UL insurance products, the value of DAC and DSIC assets, the value of liabilities for guaranteed benefits associated with our variable annuities and the value of derivatives held to hedge these benefits.   The guaranteed benefits associated with our variable annuities are GMWB, guaranteed minimum accumulation benefits (“GMAB”), guaranteed minimum death benefits (“GMDB”) and guaranteed minimum income benefits (“GMIB”). Each of these guaranteed benefits guarantees payouts to the annuity holder under certain specific conditions regardless of the performance of the underlying investment assets.   We continue to utilize a hedging program which attempts to match the sensitivity of the assets with the sensitivity of the liabilities. This approach works with the premise that matched sensitivities will produce a highly effective hedging result. Our comprehensive hedging program focuses mainly on first order sensitivities of assets and liabilities: Equity Market Level (Delta), Interest Rate Level (Rho) and Volatility (Vega). Additionally, various second order sensitivities are managed. We use various index options across the term structure, interest rate swaps and swaptions, total return swaps and futures to manage the risk exposures. The exposures are measured and monitored daily, and adjustments to the hedge portfolio are made as necessary.   To evaluate interest rate and equity price risk we perform sensitivity testing which measures the impact on pretax income from the sources listed below for a 12-month period following a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates or a hypothetical 10% decline in equity prices. The interest rate risk test assumes a sudden 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve, with rates then staying at those levels for the next 12 months. The equity price risk test assumes a sudden 10% drop in equity prices, with equity prices then staying at those levels for the next 12 months. In estimating the values of variable annuity riders, equity indexed annuities, stock market certificates, indexed universal life insurance and the associated hedge assets, we assumed no change in implied market volatility despite the 10% drop in equity prices.   The following tables present our estimate of the impact on pretax income from these hypothetical market movements as of June 30, 2013:              Equity Price Exposure to Pretax Income         Equity Price Decline 10%       Before Hedge Impact       Hedge Impact       Net Impact                 (in millions)         Asset-based management and distribution fees (1)       $   (218   )   $   14       $   (204   )     DAC and DSIC amortization (2) (3)       (97   )   —       (97   )     Variable annuity riders:                                 GMDB and GMIB (3)       (64   )   —       (64   )     GMWB       (143   )   150       7         GMAB       (45   )   46       1         DAC and DSIC amortization (4)       N/A       N/A       (3   )     Total variable annuity riders       (252   )   196       (59   )     Equity indexed annuities       1       (1   )   —         Certificates       3       (3   )   —         Indexed universal life insurance       5       (6   )   (1   )     Total       $   (558   )   $   200       $   (361   )      79      Table of Contents              Interest Rate Exposure to Pretax Income         Interest Rate Increase 100 Basis Points       Before Hedge Impact       Hedge Impact       Net Impact                 (in millions)         Asset-based management and distribution fees (1)       $   (40   )   $   —       $   (40   )     Variable annuity riders:                                 GMWB       490       (462   )   28         GMAB       31       (30   )   1         DAC and DSIC amortization (4)       N/A       N/A       (5   )     Total variable annuity riders       521       (492   )   24         Fixed annuities, fixed portion of variable annuities and fixed insurance products       49       —       49         Brokerage client cash balances       126       —       126         Certificates       5       —       5         Indexed universal life insurance       8       —       8         Total       $   669       $   (492   )   $   172           N/A Not Applicable.   (1) Excludes incentive income which is impacted by market and fund performance during the period and cannot be readily estimated. (2) Market impact on DAC and DSIC amortization resulting from lower projected profits. (3) In estimating the impact on DAC and DSIC amortization resulting from lower projected profits, we have not changed our assumed equity asset growth rates. This is a significantly more conservative estimate than if we assumed management follows its mean reversion guideline and increased near-term rates to recover the drop in equity values over a five-year period. We make this same conservative assumption in estimating the impact from GMDB and GMIB riders. (4) Market impact on DAC and DSIC amortization related to variable annuity riders is modeled net of hedge impact.   The above results compare to an estimated negative net impact to pretax income of $318 million related to a 10% equity price decline and an estimated positive net impact to pretax income of $185 million related to a 100 basis point increase in interest rates as of December 31, 2012.   Net impacts shown in the above table from GMWB and GMAB riders result largely from differences between the liability valuation basis and the hedging basis. Liabilities are valued using fair value accounting principles, with key policyholder behavior assumptions loaded to provide risk margins and with discount rates increased to reflect a current market estimate of our risk of nonperformance specific to these liabilities. For variable annuity riders introduced prior to mid-2009, management elected to hedge based on best estimate policyholder behavior assumptions. For riders issued since mid-2009, management has been hedging on a basis that includes risk margins related to policyholder behavior. The nonperformance spread risk is not hedged.   Actual results could differ materially from those illustrated above as they are based on a number of estimates and assumptions. These include assuming that implied market volatility does not change when equity prices fall by 10%, that management does not increase assumed equity asset growth rates to anticipate recovery of the drop in equity values when valuing DAC, DSIC and GMDB and GMIB liability values and that the 100 basis point increase in interest rates is a parallel shift of the yield curve. Furthermore, we have not tried to anticipate changes in client preferences for different types of assets or other changes in client behavior, nor have we tried to anticipate actions management might take to increase revenues or reduce expenses in these scenarios.   The selection of a 100 basis point interest rate increase as well as a 10% equity price decline should not be construed as a prediction of future market events. Impacts of larger or smaller changes in interest rates or equity prices may not be proportional to those shown for a 100 basis point increase in interest rates or a 10% decline in equity prices.   Fair Value Measurements   We report certain assets and liabilities at fair value; specifically, separate account assets, derivatives, embedded derivatives, properties held by our consolidated property funds, and most investments and cash equivalents. Fair value assumes the exchange of assets or liabilities occurs in orderly transactions and is not the result of a forced liquidation or distressed sale. We include actual market prices, or observable inputs, in our fair value measurements to the extent available. Broker quotes are obtained when quotes from pricing services are not available. We validate prices obtained from third parties through a variety of means such as: price variance analysis, subsequent sales testing, stale price review, price comparison across pricing vendors and due diligence reviews of vendors. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our fair value measurements.   80      Table of Contents   Fair Value of Liabilities and Nonperformance Risk   Companies are required to measure the fair value of liabilities at the price that would be received to transfer the liability to a market participant (an exit price). Since there is not a market for our obligations of our variable annuity riders and indexed universal life insurance, we consider the assumptions participants in a hypothetical market would make to reflect an exit price. As a result, we adjust the valuation of variable annuity riders and indexed universal life insurance by updating certain contractholder assumptions, adding explicit margins to provide for profit, risk and expenses, and adjusting the rates used to discount expected cash flows to reflect a current market estimate of our nonperformance risk. The nonperformance risk adjustment is based on broker quotes for credit default swaps that are adjusted to estimate the risk of our life insurance company subsidiaries not fulfilling these liabilities. Consistent with general market conditions, this estimate resulted in a spread over the LIBOR swap curve as of June 30, 2013. As our estimate of this spread widens or tightens, the liability will decrease or increase. If this nonperformance credit spread moves to a zero spread over the LIBOR swap curve, the reduction to net income would be approximately $133 million, net of DAC, DSIC and unearned revenue amortization, the reinsurance accrual and income taxes (calculated at the statutory tax rate of 35%), based on June 30, 2013 credit spreads.   Liquidity and Capital Resources   Overview   We maintained substantial liquidity during the six months ended June 30, 2013. At June 30, 2013, we had $2.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents compared to $2.4 billion at December 31, 2012. We have additional liquidity available through an unsecured revolving credit facility for up to $500 million that expires in November 2015. Under the terms of the underlying credit agreement, we can increase this facility to $750 million upon satisfaction of certain approval requirements. Available borrowings under this facility are reduced by any outstanding letters of credit. At June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012, we had no outstanding borrowings under this credit facility and had $2 million of outstanding letters of credit. Our junior subordinated notes due 2066 and credit facility contain various administrative, reporting, legal and financial covenants. We were in compliance with all such covenants at both June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012.   We enter into short-term borrowings, which may include repurchase agreements and Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) advances, to reduce reinvestment risk from higher levels of expected annuity net cash flows. Short-term borrowings allow us to receive cash to reinvest in longer-duration assets, while paying back the short-term debt with cash flows generated by the fixed income portfolio. The balance of repurchase agreements at June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012 was $201 million and $501 million, respectively, which is collateralized with agency residential mortgage backed securities and commercial mortgage backed securities from our investment portfolio. Our subsidiary, RiverSource Life Insurance Company (“RiverSource Life”), is a member of the FHLB of Des Moines, which provides access to collateralized borrowings. As of June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012, we had $300 million and nil, respectively, of borrowings from the FHLB, which is collateralized with commercial mortgage backed securities. We believe cash flows from operating activities, available cash balances and our availability of revolver borrowings will be sufficient to fund our operating liquidity needs.   Dividends from Subsidiaries   Ameriprise Financial is primarily a parent holding company for the operations carried out by our wholly owned subsidiaries. Because of our holding company structure, our ability to meet our cash requirements, including the payment of dividends on our common stock, substantially depends upon the receipt of dividends or return of capital from our subsidiaries, particularly our life insurance subsidiary, RiverSource Life, our face-amount certificate subsidiary, Ameriprise Certificate Company (“ACC”), AMPF Holding Corporation, which is the parent company of our retail introducing broker-dealer subsidiary, Ameriprise Financial Services, Inc. (“AFSI”) and our clearing broker-dealer subsidiary, American Enterprise Investment Services, Inc. (“AEIS”), our Auto and Home insurance subsidiary, IDS Property Casualty Insurance Company (“IDS Property Casualty”), doing business as Ameriprise Auto & Home Insurance, our transfer agent subsidiary, Columbia Management Investment Services Corp., our investment advisory company, Columbia Management Investment Advisers, LLC, and Threadneedle. The payment of dividends by many of our subsidiaries is restricted and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to regulatory capital requirements.   81      Table of Contents   Actual capital and regulatory capital requirements for our wholly owned subsidiaries subject to regulatory capital requirements were as follows:              Actual Capital       Regulatory Capital Requirements                 June 30, 2013       December 31, 2012       June 30, 2013       December 31, 2012                 (in millions)         RiverSource Life(1)(2)       $   2,809       $   3,257       N/A       $   620         RiverSource Life of NY(1)(2)       237       256       N/A       44         IDS Property Casualty(1)(3)       480       462       $   168       160         Ameriprise Insurance Company(1)(3)       43       43       2       2         ACC(4)(5)       218       204       200       187         Threadneedle(6)       151       183       92       156         Ameriprise National Trust Bank(7)       18       142       1       14         AFSI(3)(4)       136       88       2       2         Ameriprise Captive Insurance Company(3)       58       59       14       12         Ameriprise Trust Company(3)       55       48       51       47         AEIS(3)(4)       113       114       42       39         RiverSource Distributors, Inc.(3)(4)       26       25       #       #         Columbia Management Investment Distributors, Inc.(3)(4)       31       29       #       #                           N/A Not applicable. # Amounts are less than $1 million. (1) Actual capital is determined on a statutory basis. (2) Regulatory capital requirement is based on the statutory risk-based capital filing.  (3) Regulatory capital requirement is based on the applicable regulatory requirement, calculated as of June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012. (4) Actual capital is determined on an adjusted GAAP basis. (5) ACC is required to hold capital in compliance with the Minnesota Department of Commerce and SEC capital requirements.  (6) Actual capital and regulatory capital requirements are determined in accordance with U.K. regulatory legislation. The actual capital and the regulatory capital requirements at June 30, 2013 represent regulatory capital at June 30, 2013 and management’s assessment at September 30, 2012 of the risk based requirements, as specified by FCA regulations and submitted to the FCA in January 2013. (7) In January 2013, we completed the conversion of our federal savings bank subsidiary, Ameriprise Bank, FSB, to a limited powers national trust bank, which conversion included changing the name of this subsidiary to Ameriprise National Trust Bank. As of June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012, this subsidiary was required to maintain capital in compliance with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”) regulations and policies.   In addition to the particular regulations restricting dividend payments and establishing subsidiary capitalization requirements, we take into account the overall health of the business, capital levels and risk management considerations in determining a dividend strategy for payments to our company from our subsidiaries, and in deciding to use cash to make capital contributions to our subsidiaries.   During the six months ended June 30, 2013, the parent holding company received cash dividends or a return of capital from its subsidiaries of $990 million (including $535 million from RiverSource Life and $130 million from Ameriprise Bank) and contributed cash to its subsidiaries of $28 million. During the six months ended June 30, 2012, the parent holding company received cash dividends or a return of capital from its subsidiaries of $761 million (including $550 million from RiverSource Life) and contributed cash to its subsidiaries of $41 million.   Dividends Paid to Shareholders and Share Repurchases   We paid regular quarterly dividends to our shareholders totaling $202 million and $142 million for the six months ended June 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively. On July 24, 2013, we announced a quarterly dividend of $0.52 per common share. The dividend will be paid on August 16, 2013 to our shareholders of record at the close of business on August 5, 2013.   On October 24, 2012, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized an expenditure of up to an additional $2.0 billion for the repurchase of shares of our common stock through 2014. As of June 30, 2013, we had $1.4 billion remaining under this share repurchase authorization. We intend to fund share repurchases through existing working capital, capital released from the transition of Ameriprise Bank from a federal savings bank to a limited powers national trust bank, future earnings and other customary financing methods. The share repurchase program does not require the purchase of any minimum number of shares, and depending on market conditions and other factors, these purchases may be commenced or suspended at    82      Table of Contents   any time without prior notice. Acquisitions under the share repurchase program may be made in the open market, through privately negotiated transactions or block trades or other means. During the six months ended June 30, 2013, we repurchased a total of 10.1 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $73.35 per share.   Cash Flows   Cash flows of CIEs are reflected in our cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities, investing activities and financing activities. Cash held by CIEs is not available for general use by Ameriprise Financial, nor is Ameriprise Financial cash available for general use by its CIEs. As such, the operating, investing and financing cash flows of the CIEs have no impact to the change in cash and cash equivalents.   Operating Activities   Net cash used in operating activities was $93 million for the six months ended June 30, 2013 compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $468 million for the prior year period primarily reflecting the impact of CIEs. Operating cash flows for the six months ended June 30, 2013 included a negative impact of $636 million related to CIEs compared to a negative impact of $54 million for the prior year period primarily driven by the change in CIE cash and the change in investment properties of CIEs.   Investing Activities   Our investing activities primarily relate to our Available-for-Sale investment portfolio. Further, this activity is significantly affected by the net flows of our investment certificate, fixed annuity and universal life products reflected in financing activities.   Net cash provided by investing activities was $690 million for the six months ended June 30, 2013 compared to net cash used in investing activities of $173 million for the prior year period. The increase in cash of $517 million compared to the prior year period was primarily due to a $239 million increase in proceeds from sales and maturities, sinking fund payments and calls of Available-for-Sale securities, a $102 million increase in proceeds from sales of other investments and a $92 million increase in cash from changes in consumer loans, net.   Financing Activities   Net cash used in financing activities decreased $85 million to $618 million for the six months ended June 30, 2013 compared to $703 million for the prior year period. Net cash inflows related to investment certificates and banking time deposits increased $251 million compared to the prior year period driven by higher net proceeds from investment certificates. Cash flows for the prior year period included a cash inflow of $349 million related to changes in banking deposits, which were liquidated and returned to clients in the fourth quarter of 2012. Cash flows related to changes in policyholder and contractholder account values decreased $148 million compared to the prior year period driven by lower consideration received. Cash outflows for dividends paid to shareholders increased $58 million compared to the prior year period. Cash used for the repurchase of common stock, which includes stock repurchases and shares surrendered to cover income tax obligations of holders of share-based compensation awards, increased $141 million compared to the prior year period. Cash flows related to CIEs increased $488 million compared to the prior year period primarily due to changes in CIE debt.   Contractual Commitments   There have been no material changes to our contractual obligations disclosed in our 2012 10-K.   Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements   We provide asset management services to various collateralized debt obligations and other investment products, which are sponsored by us for the investment of client assets in the normal course of business. Certain of these investment entities are considered to be variable interest entities while others are considered to be voting rights entities. We consolidate certain of these investment entities. For entities that we do not consolidate, our maximum exposure to loss is our investment in the entity, which was not material as of June 30, 2013. We have no obligation to provide further financial or other support to these structured investments nor have we provided any support to these structured investments.
