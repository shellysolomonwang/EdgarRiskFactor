Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2016 10-K and other factors as discussed herein.Equity price, credit market and interest rate fluctuations can have a significant impact on our results of operations, primarily due to the effects they have on the asset management and other asset-based fees we earn, the “spread” income generated on our fixed deferred annuities, fixed insurance, deposit products and the fixed portion of variable annuities and variable insurance contracts, the value of deferred acquisition costs (“DAC”) and deferred sales inducement costs (“DSIC”) assets, the values of liabilities for guaranteed benefits associated with our variable annuities and the values of derivatives held to hedge these benefits.Earnings, as well as operating earnings, will continue to be negatively impacted by the ongoing low interest rate environment. In addition to continuing spread compression in our interest sensitive product lines, a sustained low interest rate environment may result in increases to our reserves and changes in various rate assumptions we use to amortize DAC and DSIC, which may negatively impact our operating earnings. For additional discussion on our interest rate risk, see Item 3. “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.”In the third quarter of the year, we updated our market-related inputs and implemented model changes related to our living benefit valuation. In addition, we conducted our annual review of life insurance and annuity valuation assumptions relative to current experience and management expectations including modeling changes. These aforementioned changes are collectively referred to as unlocking. The favorable unlocking impact in the third quarter of 2017 primarily reflected a positive impact from updates to market-related inputs to our living benefit valuation. In addition, premium deficiency testing for our long term care (“LTC”) business resulted in a loss recognition reserve of $57 million in the third quarter of 2017 primarily due to higher morbidity, partially offset by premium increases.The unfavorable unlocking impact in the third quarter of 2016 primarily reflected low interest rates and higher persistency on living benefit contracts that more than offset benefits from persistency on annuity contracts without living benefits, an update to market-related inputs related to our living benefit valuation and other model updates. Our long-term interest rate assumption remained unchanged, but we extended the period it would take for rates to reach our long term level from 3.5 years to 5.5 years. In addition, our review of our LTC business in the third quarter of 2016 resulted in a loss recognition of $31 million due to low interest rates, higher morbidity and higher reinsurance expenses, slightly offset by premium increases. The $31 million, which is included in the unlocking impact in the third quarter of 2016, was comprised of $58 million of amortization of DAC and the release of the related deferred reinsurance liability of $27 million. 52AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. See our Consolidated and Segment Results of Operations sections below for the pretax impacts on our revenues and expenses attributable to unlocking and additional discussion of the drivers of the unlocking impact.We consolidate certain variable interest entities for which we provide asset management services. These entities are defined as consolidated investment entities (“CIEs”). While the consolidation of the CIEs impacts our balance sheet and income statement, our exposure to these entities is unchanged and there is no impact to the underlying business results. For further information on CIEs, see Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. The results of operations of the CIEs are reflected in the Corporate & Other segment. On a consolidated basis, the management fees we earn for the services we provide to the CIEs and the related general and administrative expenses are eliminated and the changes in the fair value of assets and liabilities related to the CIEs, primarily syndicated loans and debt, are reflected in net investment income. We continue to include the fees from these entities in the management and financial advice fees line within our Asset Management segment. While our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), management believes that operating measures, which exclude net realized investment gains or losses, net of the related DSIC and DAC amortization, unearned revenue amortization and the reinsurance accrual; the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits, net of hedges and the related DSIC and DAC amortization; the market impact on indexed universal life benefits, net of hedges and the related DAC amortization, unearned revenue amortization and the reinsurance accrual; the market impact of hedges to offset interest rate changes on unrealized gains or losses for certain investments; integration and restructuring charges; and the impact of consolidating CIEs, best reflect the underlying performance of our core operations and facilitate a more meaningful trend analysis. Management uses certain of these non-GAAP measures to evaluate our financial performance on a basis comparable to that used by some securities analysts and investors. Also, certain of these non-GAAP measures are taken into consideration, to varying degrees, for purposes of business planning and analysis and for certain compensation-related matters. Throughout our Management’s Discussion and Analysis, these non-GAAP measures are referred to as operating measures. These non-GAAP measures should not be viewed as a substitute for U.S. GAAP measures.It is management’s priority to increase shareholder value over a multi-year horizon by achieving our on-average, over-time financial targets.Our financial targets are:•Operating total net revenue growth of 6% to 8%,•Operating earnings per diluted share growth of 12% to 15%, and•Operating return on equity excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) of 19% to 23%.The following tables reconcile our GAAP measures to operating measures:  Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,2017 2016 2017 2016(in millions)Total net revenues$2,981 $2,998 $8,867 $8,634Less: Revenue attributable to CIEs23 27 70 77Less: Net realized investment gains (losses)(3) 6 35 (5)Less: Market impact on indexed universal life benefits(5) 6 (7) 18Less: Market impact of hedges on investments(1) 5 (8) (54)Operating total net revenues$2,967 $2,954 $8,777 $8,59853AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC.

After-tax is calculated using the statutory rate of 35%.The Department of Labor published regulations in April 2016 that expanded the scope of who is considered an ERISA fiduciary and these regulations focus in large part on investment recommendations made by financial advisors, registered investment advisors, and other investment professionals to retirement investors, how financial advisors are able to discuss IRA rollovers, as well as how financial advisors and affiliates can transact with retirement investors. Tax qualified accounts, particularly IRAs, make up a significant portion of our assets under management and administration. The first phase of the regulations went into effect on June 9, 2017 and requires financial advisors to make recommendations related to assets held in IRAs and employer sponsored retirement plans in accordance with the following impartial conduct standards: recommendations must be in the best interest of the client, compensation paid for the recommendations must be reasonable and the financial advisor must not make any misleading statements. We adopted policies and procedures designed to comply with the impartial conduct standards and communicated those policies and procedures to our advisors and staff. The second phase of the regulation pertaining to a new “best interest contract exemption” puts into place a number of additional requirements including entering into a best interest contract with clients, enhanced disclosure of fees and conflicts of interest, limits on differential commissions within a product category, the adoption of policies and procedures to ensure the best interest standard is met, and findings related to platforms that are limited to products that pay third-party payments and/or include proprietary products. The second phase of the regulation is currently scheduled to become effective on January 1, 2018. These regulations are currently under review by the Department of Labor and the Department has proposed to delay the second phase of the regulations until July 1, 2019, which would give the Department of Labor more time to determine if further revisions to the regulations are advisable. However, as of November 1 the Department of Labor has not issued final guidance implementing a further delay. As a result, it is unclear whether the Department of Labor will substantially rescind or revise the regulations as adopted in 2016. In light of the uncertainty regarding the fiduciary regulation, while we prudently continue to prepare to comply with the second phase of the Department of Labor’s investment fiduciary regulations and exemptions in the form in which they were adopted in April 2016, we are also evaluating the impact to our clients, financial advisors and business should the Department of Labor decide to delay, rescind or revise the regulations per the developments since President Trump’s inauguration as generally described above.Critical Accounting EstimatesThe accounting and reporting policies that we use affect our Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of our accounting and reporting policies are critical to an understanding of our consolidated results of operations and financial condition and, in some cases, 55AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. the application of these policies can be significantly affected by the estimates, judgments and assumptions made by management during the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements. These accounting policies are discussed in detail in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis — Critical Accounting Estimates” in our 2016 10-K.Recent Accounting PronouncementsFor information regarding recent accounting pronouncements and their expected impact on our future consolidated results of operations and financial condition, see Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.Assets Under Management and AdministrationAssets under management (“AUM”) include external client assets for which we provide investment management services, such as the assets of the Columbia Threadneedle funds, assets of institutional clients and assets of clients in our advisor platform held in wrap accounts as well as assets managed by sub-advisors selected by us. AUM also includes certain assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets for which we provide investment management services and recognize management fees in our Asset Management segment, such as the assets of the general account and the variable product funds held in the separate accounts of our life insurance subsidiaries and CIEs. These assets do not include assets under advisement, for which we provide model portfolios but do not have full discretionary investment authority. Corporate & Other AUM primarily includes former bank assets that are managed within our Corporate & Other segment.Assets under administration (“AUA”) include assets for which we provide administrative services such as client assets invested in other companies’ products that we offer outside of our wrap accounts. These assets include those held in clients’ brokerage accounts. We generally record revenues received from administered assets as distribution fees. We do not exercise management discretion over these assets and do not earn a management fee. These assets are not reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. AUA also includes certain assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets for which we do not provide investment management services and do not recognize management fees, such as investments in non-affiliated funds held in the separate accounts of our life insurance subsidiaries. These assets do not include assets under advisement, for which we provide model portfolios but do not have full discretionary investment authority.The following table presents detail regarding our AUM and AUA: September 30, Change2017 2016(in billions)  Assets Under Management and AdministrationAdvice & Wealth Management AUM$233.9 $196.2 $37.7 19 %Asset Management AUM484.0 467.8 16.2 3Corporate & Other AUM0.3 0.3 — —Eliminations(25.9) (24.7) (1.2) (5)Total Assets Under Management692.3 639.6 52.7 8Total Assets Under Administration177.2 156.0 21.2 14Total AUM and AUA$869.5 $795.6 $73.9 9 %Total AUM increased $52.7 billion, or 8%, to $692.3 billion as of September 30, 2017 compared to $639.6 billion as of September 30, 2016 primarily due to a $37.7 billion increase in Advice & Wealth Management AUM driven by wrap account net inflows and market appreciation and a $16.2 billion increase in Asset Management AUM driven by market appreciation and a positive impact of foreign currency translation, partially offset by net outflows. See our segment results of operations discussion below for additional information on changes in our AUM.56AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. Consolidated Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2017 and 2016 The following table presents our consolidated results of operations: Three Months Ended September 30, Change2017 2016(in millions)  RevenuesManagement and financial advice fees$1,626 $1,464 $162 11 %Distribution fees437 455 (18) (4)Net investment income372 387 (15) (4)Premiums348 374 (26) (7)Other revenues210 330 (120) (36)Total revenues2,993 3,010 (17) (1)Banking and deposit interest expense12 12 — —Total net revenues2,981 2,998 (17) (1)ExpensesDistribution expenses850 798 52 7Interest credited to fixed accounts176 161 15 9Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses474 855 (381) (45)Amortization of deferred acquisition costs48 163 (115) (71)Interest and debt expense52 52 — —General and administrative expense753 731 22 3Total expenses2,353 2,760 (407) (15)%Pretax income628 238 390 NMIncome tax provision125 23 102 NMNet income$503 $215 $288 NMNM Not Meaningful.OverallPretax income increased $390 million to $628 million for the three months ended September 30, 2017 compared to $238 million for the prior year period primarily due to the impact of unlocking, market appreciation, wrap account net inflows, a positive impact of higher short-term interest rates and an unfavorable $29 million LTC reserve correction in the third quarter of 2016, partially offset by asset management net outflows, loss recognition of $57 million on LTC insurance products in the third quarter of 2017 and higher performance-based compensation. The following table presents the total pretax impacts on our revenues and expenses attributable to unlocking for the three months ended September 30:Pretax Increase (Decrease) 2017 2016  (in millions)Other revenues $(47) $64Total revenues (47) 64     Distribution expenses — (27)Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses (139) 229Amortization of DAC (12) 81Total expenses (151) 283Total (1) $104 $(219)(1) Includes a $5 million and $16 million net benefit related to the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits for the three months ended September 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively.57AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. Net RevenuesNet revenues decreased $17 million, or 1%, to $3.0 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2017 compared to the prior year period primarily due to the impact of unlocking, a $54 million decrease in revenues from the net impact of transitioning advisory accounts to share classes without 12b-1 fees, asset management net outflows, lower earned interest rates on fixed annuities and higher ceded premiums for our auto and home business, partially offset by market appreciation, wrap account net inflows and a positive impact of higher short-term interest rates. Management and financial advice fees increased $162 million, or 11%, to $1.6 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2017 compared to $1.5 billion for the prior year period primarily due to an increase in AUM, as well as a $15 million increase in performance fees. Average AUM increased $46.5 billion, or 7%, compared to the prior year period due to market appreciation and wrap account net inflows, partially offset by asset management net outflows. See our discussion on the changes in AUM in our segment results of operations section. Distribution fees decreased $18 million, or 4%, to $437 million for the three months ended September 30, 2017 compared to $455 million for the prior year period primarily due to a $64 million decrease related to our transition to share classes without 12b-1 fees in advisory accounts, partially offset by market appreciation and higher brokerage cash spread due to an increase in short-term interest rates.Premiums decreased $26 million, or 7%, to $348 million for the three months ended September 30, 2017 compared to $374 million for the prior year period primarily reflecting higher ceded premiums for our auto and home business due to new reinsurance arrangements we entered into at the beginning of the year to reduce risk. Other revenues decreased $120 million, or 36%, to $210 million for the three months ended September 30, 2017 compared to $330 million for the prior year period due to the impact of unlocking. Other revenues for the third quarter of 2017 included a $47 million unfavorable impact from unlocking compared to a $64 million favorable impact in the prior year period. The primary driver of the unlocking impact to other revenues for the third quarter of 2017 was a negative impact from lower projected gains on reinsurance contracts resulting from favorable mortality experience. The primary driver of the unlocking impact to other revenues for the prior year period was a positive impact from higher projected gains on reinsurance contracts resulting from unfavorable mortality experience.ExpensesTotal expenses decreased $407 million, or 15%, to $2.4 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2017 compared to $2.8 billion the prior year period primarily due to the impact of unlocking, partially offset by higher distribution expenses.Distribution expenses increased $52 million, or 7%, to $850 million for the three months ended September 30, 2017 compared to $798 million for the prior year period primarily due to market appreciation, wrap account net inflows and a $27 million benefit in the prior year period related to the write-off of the deferred reinsurance liability in connection with loss recognition testing of LTC insurance products, partially offset by a $43 million decrease from changes related to our transition to share classes without 12b-1 fees in advisory accounts and asset management net outflows. Interest credited to fixed accounts increased $15 million, or 9%, to $176 million for the three months ended September 30, 2017 compared to $161 million for the prior year period primarily due to the market impact on indexed universal life benefits, net of hedges, which was an expense of $8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2017 compared to a benefit of $5 million for the prior year period.Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses decreased $381 million, or 45%, to $474 million for the three months ended September 30, 2017 compared to $855 million for the prior year period primarily reflecting the following items:•The three months ended September 30, 2017 included a $139 million benefit from unlocking compared to a $229 million expense in the prior year period. The unlocking impact for the third quarter of 2017 primarily reflected a benefit from updates to market-related inputs to our living benefit valuation. The unlocking impact for the prior year period primarily reflected low interest rates and an unfavorable impact from persistency on living benefit reserves, partially offset by a benefit from updates to withdrawal utilization and fee assumptions, as well as market-related inputs to our living benefit valuation. •A $29 million increase in LTC reserves from a correction related to our claim utilization assumption in the third quarter of 2016.•A $26 million decrease in auto and home expenses reflecting the impact of new reinsurance arrangements, a lower non-catastrophe loss ratio and an $8 million benefit from a correction of a reinsurance recoverable estimate, partially offset by higher gross catastrophe losses and a $10 million positive impact from prior year reserve development in the third quarter of 2016. Catastrophe losses, net of the impact of reinsurance, were $15 million for the three months ended September 30, 2017, primarily related to Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, compared to $29 million for the prior year period. In the first quarter of 2017, we entered into quota share and excess of loss reinsurance arrangements designed to reduce net retained exposure to property losses. The expanded reinsurance program resulted in ceded losses of approximately $38 million in the third quarter. •A $57 million expense from loss recognition on LTC insurance products in the third quarter of 2017 primarily due to unfavorable morbidity experience, partially offset by premium increases.58AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. Amortization of DAC decreased $115 million, or 71%, to $48 million for the three months ended September 30, 2017 compared to $163 million for the prior year period primarily reflecting the impact of unlocking, which was a benefit of $12 million for the three months ended September 30, 2017 compared to an expense of $81 million for the prior year period. The impact of unlocking in the third quarter of 2017 primarily reflected improved persistency and mortality on life insurance contracts and a $10 million benefit from a correction related to a variable annuity model assumption, partially offset by updates to market-related inputs to the living benefit valuation. The impact of unlocking in the prior year period primarily reflected low interest rates that more than offset benefits from persistency on annuity contracts without living benefits. In addition, we wrote-off $58 million of DAC in connection with the loss recognition on LTC insurance products in the prior year period. General and administrative expense increased $22 million, or 3%, to $753 million for the three months ended September 30, 2017 compared to $731 million for the prior year period primarily due to higher performance-based compensation.Income TaxesOur effective tax rate was 19.9% for the three months ended September 30, 2017 compared to 9.7% for the prior year period. Our effective tax rates for the three months ended September 30, 2017 and 2016 are lower than the statutory rate as a result of tax preferred items including the dividends received deduction, low income housing tax credits, stock compensation, and lower taxes on net income from foreign subsidiaries. The increase in the effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2017 compared to the prior year period is primarily due to higher pretax income, partially offset by a $25 million benefit for stock compensation due to the adoption of a new accounting standard.Results of Operations by Segment for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2017 and 2016 Operating earnings is the measure of segment profit or loss management uses to evaluate segment performance. Operating earnings should not be viewed as a substitute for GAAP pretax income. We believe the presentation of segment operating earnings as we measure it for management purposes enhances the understanding of our business by reflecting the underlying performance of our core operations and facilitating a more meaningful trend analysis. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the presentation of segment results and our definition of operating earnings.Beginning in the first quarter of 2017, the long term care business, which had been reported as part of the Protection segment, is reflected in the Corporate & Other segment. We discontinued underwriting long term care insurance in 2002 and the transfer of this closed block to the Corporate & Other segment allows investors to better understand the performance of our on-going Protection businesses. Prior periods presented have been restated to reflect the change.

Pretax operating margin was 21.5% for the three months ended September 30, 2017 compared to 18.2% for the prior year period.Net RevenuesNet revenues exclude net realized investment gains or losses. Net revenues increased $111 million, or 9%, to $1.4 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2017 compared to $1.3 billion for the prior year period primarily due to growth in wrap account assets, higher earnings on brokerage cash and a $12 million increase in revenues from IPI, partially offset by lower 12b-1 fee revenue. During the first quarter, we completed our transition to share classes without 12b-1 fees in advisory accounts, which reduced revenue by a net $54 million in the third quarter compared to the prior year period. Operating net revenue per advisor increased to $140,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2017, up 7%, from $131,000 for the prior year period. Total advisors were 9,890 at September 30, 2017 compared to 9,747 at September 30, 2016. Management and financial fees increased $110 million, or 16%, to $799 million for the three months ended September 30, 2017 compared to $689 million for the prior year period primarily due to growth in wrap account assets. Average advisory wrap account assets increased $34.3 billion, or 18%, compared to the prior year period reflecting net inflows and market appreciation.Distribution fees decreased $16 million, or 3%, to $515 million for the three months ended September 30, 2017 compared to $531 million for the prior year period primarily due to a $64 million decrease related to our transition to share classes without 12b-1 fees in advisory accounts, partially offset by higher brokerage cash spread due to an increase in short-term interest rates and revenues from IPI.Net investment income increased $17 million, or 36%, to $64 million for the three months ended September 30, 2017 compared to $47 million for the prior year period primarily due to higher investment yields and an increase in invested balances driven by certificate net inflows.ExpensesTotal expenses increased $44 million, or 4%, to $1.1 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2017 compared to $1.0 billion for the prior year period due to increases in distribution expenses and general and administrative expense.Distribution expenses increased $32 million, or 4%, to $813 million for the three months ended September 30, 2017 compared to $781 million for the prior year period reflecting higher advisor compensation due to growth in wrap account assets, the IPI acquisition and investments in recruiting experienced advisors, partially offset by a $43 million decrease related to our transition to share classes without 12b-1 fees in advisory accounts.General and administrative expense increased $12 million, or 5%, to $270 million for the three months ended September 30, 2017 compared to $258 million for the prior year period due to higher performance-based compensation, as well as higher expenses related to the IPI acquisition.61AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC.

The change was a decrease of $65 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016. In a referendum in June 2016, the United Kingdom (UK) voted to leave the European Union (EU), which caused volatility in capital and currency markets. Further, in March 2017 the UK invoked article 50 of the Treaty of Lisbon in serving its relevant notice to leave the European Union on March 30, 2019. The full impact of the British exit from the EU (commonly known as “Brexit”) remains uncertain. This uncertainty, which is expected to last for a lengthy period of time, has had and may have a negative impact on our UK and European net flows and foreign currency translation resulting from the weakening of the British Pound.Total segment AUM increased $11.4 billion, or 2%, during the three months ended September 30, 2017 driven by market appreciation and a positive impact of foreign currency translation, partially offset by net outflows. Total segment AUM net outflows were $4.7 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2017, which included $3.0 billion of outflows of former parent-related assets. Management expects, consistent with prior patterns of outflows, that outflows of primarily low margin assets directly or indirectly affiliated with Threadneedle and Columbia former parent companies will continue for the foreseeable future. The overall impact to segment results is difficult to quantify due to uncertain timing, volume and mix of the outflows. Former parent company related AUM was approximately $73 billion as of September 30, 2017.64AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. Global retail net outflows of $1.7 billion included $0.8 billion of outflows of our variable product funds underlying insurance and annuity separate accounts and $0.6 billion of outflows from former parent-related assets. In U.S. retail, net outflows excluding the former parent-related assets were $1.5 billion, reflecting ongoing industry pressure on active strategies. In Europe, Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”), net inflows were $0.4 billion.Global institutional net outflows of $3.0 billion included $2.4 billion of outflows from former parent-related assets. Institutional outflows from former parent-related assets included Zurich outflows of $0.9 billion and U.S. Trust outflows of $1.5 billion.On September 20, 2017, we announced our acquisition of Lionstone Investments, a leading national real estate investment firm, specializing in investment strategies based upon proprietary analytics. The acquisition closed on November 1, 2017 and adds approximately $6 billion in assets under management.The following table presents the results of operations of our Asset Management segment on an operating basis: Three Months Ended September 30, Change2017 2016(in millions)  RevenuesManagement and financial advice fees$657 $612 $45 7 %Distribution fees111 125 (14) (11)Net investment income6 1 5 NMOther revenues4 2 2 NMTotal revenues778 740 38 5Banking and deposit interest expense— — — —Total net revenues778 740 38 5ExpensesDistribution expenses246 261 (15) (6)Amortization of deferred acquisition costs4 4 — —Interest and debt expense5 5 — —General and administrative expense323 315 8 3Total expenses578 585 (7) (1)Operating earnings$200 $155 $45 29 %NM Not Meaningful.Our Asset Management segment pretax operating earnings, which exclude net realized investment gains or losses, increased $45 million, or 29%, to $200 million for the three months ended September 30, 2017 compared to $155 million for the prior year period primarily due to market appreciation, a $7 million increase in performance fees (net of related compensation), an $8 million increase in incentive fees from CLO unwinds and continued expense management, partially offset by net outflows. Net RevenuesNet revenues, which exclude net realized investment gains or losses, increased $38 million, or 5%, to $778 million for the three months ended September 30, 2017 compared to $740 million for the prior year period reflecting market appreciation, higher performance fees and an increase in incentive fees from CLO unwinds, partially offset by net outflows and a $13 million decrease related to the transition of advisory accounts to share classes without 12b-1 fees. The Asset Management segment revenue related to 12b-1 fees is eliminated on a consolidated basis.Management and financial advice fees increased $45 million, or 7%, to $657 million for the three months ended September 30, 2017 compared to $612 million for the prior year period driven by market appreciation, a $15 million increase in performance fees and an $8 million increase in incentive fees from CLO unwinds, partially offset by cumulative net outflows from former parent-related assets and higher fee yielding retail funds. Our average weighted equity index, which is a proxy for equity movements on AUM, increased 14% for the three months ended September 30, 2017 compared to the prior year period. Distribution fees decreased $14 million, or 11%, to $111 million for the three months ended September 30, 2017 compared to $125 million for the prior year period due to cumulative net outflows and a $13 million decrease related to the transition of advisory accounts to share classes without 12b-1 fees, partially offset by market appreciation. ExpensesTotal expenses decreased $7 million, or 1%, to $578 million for the three months ended September 30, 2017 compared to $585 million for the prior year period due to lower distribution expenses, partially offset by higher general and administrative expense. 65AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. Distribution expenses decreased $15 million, or 6%, to $246 million for the three months ended September 30, 2017 compared to $261 million for the prior year period due to lower compensation driven by cumulative net outflows and a decrease related to the transition of advisory accounts to share classes without 12b-1 fees, partially offset by market appreciation. The Asset Management segment expense related to 12b-1 fees is eliminated on a consolidated basis.General and administrative expense increased $8 million, or 3%, to $323 million for the three months ended September 30, 2017 compared to $315 million for the prior year period due to an $8 million increase in compensation related to higher performance fees.AnnuitiesThe following table presents the results of operations of our Annuities segment on an operating basis: Three Months Ended September 30, Change2017 2016(in millions)  RevenuesManagement and financial advice fees$196 $188 $8 4 %Distribution fees91 89 2 2Net investment income173 192 (19) (10)Premiums24 29 (5) (17)Other revenues142 133 9 7Total revenues626 631 (5) (1)Banking and deposit interest expense— — — —Total net revenues626 631 (5) (1)ExpensesDistribution expenses105 106 (1) (1)Interest credited to fixed accounts121 122 (1) (1)Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses19 346 (327) (95)Amortization of deferred acquisition costs40 66 (26) (39)Interest and debt expense9 7 2 29General and administrative expense51 52 (1) (2)Total expenses345 699 (354) (51)%Operating earnings (loss)$281 $(68) $349 NMNM Not Meaningful.Our Annuities segment pretax operating income, which excludes net realized investment gains or losses (net of the related DSIC and DAC amortization) and the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits (net of hedges and the related DSIC and DAC amortization), increased $349 million to $281 million for the three months ended September 30, 2017 compared to a loss of $68 million for the prior year period primarily due to the impact of unlocking. RiverSource variable annuity account balances increased 4% to $78.7 billion at September 30, 2017 compared to the prior year period due to equity market appreciation, partially offset by net outflows of $3.7 billion. Lapse rates were higher in the quarter, reflecting increased client asset transfers from variable annuities to fee-based investment advisory accounts.RiverSource fixed deferred annuity account balances declined 7% to $9.5 billion at September 30, 2017 compared to the prior year period as older policies continue to lapse and new sales are limited due to low interest rates. Given the current interest rate environment, our current fixed deferred annuity book is expected to gradually run off and earnings on our fixed deferred annuity business will trend down.Net RevenuesNet revenues, which exclude net realized investment gains or losses, decreased $5 million, or 1%, to $626 million for the three months ended September 30, 2017 compared to $631 million for the prior year period due to lower investment yields and net outflows in fixed and variable annuities, partially offset by equity market appreciation and an increase in variable annuity rider fees.Management and financial advice fees increased $8 million, or 4%, to $196 million for the three months ended September 30, 2017 compared to $188 million for the prior year period due to higher fees on variable annuities driven by higher average separate account balances. Average variable annuity account balances increased $2.1 billion, or 3%, from the prior year period due to market appreciation, partially offset by net outflows.66AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. Net investment income, which excludes net realized investment gains or losses, decreased $19 million, or 10%, to $173 million for the three months ended September 30, 2017 compared to $192 million for the prior year period reflecting a decrease of approximately $11 million from lower earned interest rates and approximately $8 million from lower invested assets due to fixed annuity net outflows.Other revenues increased $9 million, or 7%, to $142 million for the three months ended September 30, 2017 compared to $133 million for the prior year period due to higher fees from variable annuity guarantee sales in the prior year where the fees start on the first anniversary date and higher average fee rates.ExpensesTotal expenses, which exclude the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits (net of hedges and the related DSIC and DAC amortization) and the DAC and DSIC offset to net realized investment gains or losses, decreased $354 million, or 51%, to $345 million for the three months ended September 30, 2017 compared to $699 million for the prior year period primarily due to the impact of unlocking. Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses, which exclude the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits (net of hedges and the related DSIC amortization) and the DSIC offset to net realized investment gains or losses, decreased $327 million, or 95%, to $19 million for the three months ended September 30, 2017 compared to $346 million for the prior year period primarily due to the impact of unlocking, which was a $119 million benefit for the third quarter of 2017 compared to a $197 million expense for the prior year period. The unlocking impact for the third quarter of 2017 primarily reflected a benefit from updates to market-related inputs to our living benefit valuation. The unlocking impact for the prior year period primarily reflected low interest rates and an unfavorable impact from persistency on living benefit reserves, partially offset by a benefit from updates to withdrawal utilization and fee assumptions, as well as market-related inputs related to our living benefit valuation. Amortization of DAC decreased $26 million, or 39%, to $40 million for the three months ended September 30, 2017 compared to $66 million for the prior year period primarily reflecting the impact of unlocking, which was a benefit of $1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2017 compared to an expense of $18 million for the prior year period. The impact of unlocking in the third quarter of 2017 primarily reflected a $10 million benefit from a correction related to a variable annuity model assumption and slightly higher interest rates, largely offset by updates to market-related inputs to the living benefit valuation. The impact of unlocking in the prior year period primarily reflected low interest rates that more than offset benefits from persistency on annuity contracts without living benefits. Our long-term interest rate assumption remained unchanged, but we extended the period it would take for rates to reach our long term level from 3.5 years to 5.5 years.ProtectionThe following table presents the results of operations of our Protection segment on an operating basis: Three Months Ended September 30, Change2017 2016(in millions)  RevenuesManagement and financial advice fees$12 $13 $(1) (8)%Distribution fees24 24 — —Net investment income86 85 1 1Premiums305 323 (18) (6)Other revenues51 168 (117) (70)Total revenues478 613 (135) (22)Banking and deposit interest expense— — — —Total net revenues478 613 (135) (22)ExpensesDistribution expenses17 17 — —Interest credited to fixed accounts47 44 3 7Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses278 363 (85) (23)Amortization of deferred acquisition costs13 38 (25) (66)Interest and debt expense7 6 1 17General and administrative expense61 61 — —Total expenses423 529 (106) (20)Operating earnings$55 $84 $(29) (35)%67AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC.

In the first quarter of 2017, we entered into reinsurance arrangements designed to reduce risk, particularly in several wind/hail states where losses have been elevated.Other revenues decreased $117 million, or 70%, to $51 million for the three months ended September 30, 2017 compared to $168 million for the prior year period due to the impact of unlocking. Other revenues for the third quarter of 2017 included a $47 million unfavorable impact from unlocking compared to a $64 million favorable impact in the prior year period. The primary driver of the unlocking impact to other revenues for the third quarter of 2017 was a negative impact from lower projected gains on reinsurance contracts resulting from favorable mortality experience. The primary driver of the unlocking impact to other revenues for the prior year period was a positive impact from higher projected gains on reinsurance contracts resulting from unfavorable mortality experience.ExpensesTotal expenses, which exclude the market impact on indexed universal life benefits (net of hedges and the related DAC amortization) and the DAC offset to net realized investment gains or losses, decreased $106 million, or 20%, to $423 million for the three months ended September 30, 2017 compared to $529 million for the prior year period primarily due to the impact of unlocking and a decrease in auto and home expenses. Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses decreased $85 million, or 23%, to $278 million for the three months ended September 30, 2017 compared to $363 million for the prior year period due to the impact of unlocking and a $26 million decrease in auto and home expenses reflecting the impact of new reinsurance arrangements, a lower non-catastrophe loss ratio and an $8 million benefit from a correction of a reinsurance recoverable estimate, partially offset by higher gross catastrophe losses and a $10 million positive impact from prior year reserve development in the third quarter of 2016. The unlocking impact for the third quarter of 2017 was a $14 million benefit and primarily reflected favorable mortality experience on life insurance contracts. The unlocking impact for the third quarter of 2016 was a $40 million expense and primarily reflected low interest rates and unfavorable mortality experience. Catastrophe losses, net of the impact of reinsurance, were $15 million for the three months ended September 30, 2017, primarily related to Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, compared to $29 million for the prior year period. In the first quarter of 2017, we entered into quota share and excess of loss reinsurance arrangements designed to reduce net retained exposure to property losses. The expanded reinsurance program resulted in ceded losses of approximately $38 million in the third quarter. Amortization of DAC decreased $25 million, or 66%, to $13 million for the three months ended September 30, 2017 compared to $38 million for the prior year period primarily reflecting the impact of unlocking, which was a benefit of $13 million for the three months ended September 30, 2017 compared to an expense of $7 million for the prior year period. The impact of unlocking in the third quarter of 2017 primarily reflected improved persistency and mortality on life insurance contracts. 68AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC.

Our Corporate & Other segment pretax operating loss decreased $9 million, or 6%, to $136 million for the three months ended September 30, 2017 compared to $145 million for the prior year period reflecting loss recognition on LTC insurance products of $31 million in the prior year period and a $29 million increase in LTC reserves in the prior year period from a correction related to our claim utilization assumption, partially offset by LTC loss recognition of $57 million for the three months ended September 30, 2017.Distribution expenses increased $29 million to a benefit of $2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2017 compared to a benefit of $31 million for the prior year period. Distribution expenses for the prior year period included a $27 million benefit related to the write-off of the deferred reinsurance liability in connection with loss recognition on LTC insurance products.Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses increased $18 million, or 18%, to $119 million for the three months ended September 30, 2017 compared to $101 million for the prior year period primarily due to a $57 million expense from loss recognition on LTC insurance products in the third quarter of 2017, partially offset by a $29 million increase in LTC reserves in the prior year period from a correction related to our claim utilization assumption. The LTC loss recognition in the third quarter of 2017 was primarily due to unfavorable morbidity experience, partially offset by premium increases. Amortization of DAC decreased $59 million compared to the prior year period reflecting the write-off of DAC in the third quarter of 2016 in connection with the loss recognition on LTC insurance products.69AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC.

The following market-related impacts were also significant drivers of the year-over-year change in pretax income: •The market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits (net of hedges and the related DSIC and DAC amortization) was an expense of $198 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 compared to an expense of $78 million for the prior year period. •The market impact on indexed universal life benefits (net of hedges and the related DAC amortization, unearned revenue amortization and the reinsurance accrual) was an expense of $16 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 compared to a benefit of $31 million for the prior year period.•The market impact of hedges on investments was an expense of $8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 compared to an expense of $54 million for the prior year period.•Net realized investment gains were $33 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 compared to net realized investment losses of $5 million for the prior year period.•The impact on DAC, DSIC and reserves for insurance features in non-traditional long-duration contracts from actual versus expected market performance based on our view of bond and equity performance was a benefit of $63 million ($27 million for DAC, $6 million for DSIC and $30 million for insurance features in non-traditional long duration contracts) for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 reflecting favorable equity market and bond fund returns compared to a benefit of $5 million ($3 million for DAC, $1 million for DSIC and $1 million for insurance features in non-traditional long duration contracts) for the prior year period.70AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. See the table of total pretax impacts on our revenues and expenses attributable to unlocking within our Consolidated Results of Operations for the three months ended September 30, 2017.Net RevenuesNet revenues increased $233 million, or 3%, to $8.9 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 compared to $8.6 billion for the prior year period primarily due to market appreciation, wrap account net inflows, an increase in net investment income, and higher brokerage cash spread due to an increase in short-term interest rates, partially offset by the impact of unlocking, a $138 million decrease in revenues from the net impact of transitioning advisory accounts to share classes without 12b-1 fees, asset management net outflows and higher ceded premiums for our auto and home business. Management and financial advice fees increased $380 million, or 9%, to $4.7 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 compared to $4.3 billion for the prior year period primarily due to an increase in AUM. Average AUM increased $37.9 billion, or 6%, compared to the prior year period due to market appreciation and wrap account net inflows, partially offset by asset management net outflows and the negative impact of foreign currency translation. See our discussion on the changes in AUM in our segment results of operations section. Distribution fees decreased $28 million, or 2%, to $1.3 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 compared to the prior year period primarily due to a $162 million decrease related to our transition to share classes without 12b-1 fees in advisory accounts, partially offset by market appreciation and higher brokerage cash spread due to an increase in short-term interest rates.Net investment income increased $64 million, or 6%, to $1.2 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 compared to $1.1 billion for the prior year period primarily due to a $46 million favorable change in the market impact of hedges on investments and net realized investment gains of $35 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 compared to net realized investment losses of $5 million for the prior year period, partially offset by a $16 million decrease in investment income on fixed maturities driven by lower earned interest rates and fixed annuity net outflows. Premiums decreased $79 million, or 7%, to $1.0 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 compared to $1.1 billion for the prior year period primarily reflecting higher ceded premiums for our auto and home business due to new reinsurance arrangements we entered into at the beginning of the year to reduce risk. Other revenues decreased $99 million, or 12%, to $733 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 compared to $832 million for the prior year period primarily due to the impact of unlocking, partially offset by higher fees from variable annuity guarantee sales in the prior year where the fees start on the first anniversary date and higher average fee rates. Other revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 included a $47 million unfavorable impact from unlocking compared to a $64 million favorable impact in the prior year period. The primary driver of the unlocking impact to other revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 was a negative impact from lower projected gains on reinsurance contracts resulting from favorable mortality experience. The primary driver of the unlocking impact to other revenues for the prior year period was a positive impact from higher projected gains on reinsurance contracts resulting from unfavorable mortality experience.ExpensesTotal expenses decreased $258 million, or 3%, to $7.3 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 compared to $7.5 billion for the prior year period primarily due to the impact of unlocking, partially offset by higher distribution expenses.Distribution expenses increased $134 million, or 6%, to $2.5 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 compared to $2.4 billion for the prior year period reflecting market appreciation, wrap account net inflows and a $27 million benefit in the prior year period related to the write-off of the deferred reinsurance liability in connection with loss recognition testing of LTC insurance products, partially offset by a $106 million decrease from changes related to our transition to share classes without 12b-1 fees in advisory accounts and asset management net outflows. Interest credited to fixed accounts increased $44 million, or 9%, to $509 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 compared to $465 million for the prior year period primarily due to the market impact on indexed universal life benefits, net of hedges, which was an expense of $14 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 compared to a benefit of $25 million for the prior year period. Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses decreased $282 million, or 15%, to $1.7 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 compared to $1.9 billion for the prior year period primarily reflecting the following items:•The nine months ended September 30, 2017 included a $139 million benefit from unlocking compared to a $229 million expense in the prior year period. The unlocking impact for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 primarily reflected a benefit from updates to market-related inputs to our living benefit valuation. The unlocking impact for the prior year period primarily reflected low interest rates and an unfavorable impact from persistency on living benefit reserves, partially offset by a benefit from updates to withdrawal utilization and fee assumptions, as well as market-related inputs related to our living benefit valuation. •A $29 million increase in LTC reserves from a correction related to our claim utilization assumption in the third quarter of 2016.71AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. •The impact on DSIC and reserves for insurance features in non-traditional long-duration contracts from actual versus expected market performance based on our view of bond and equity performance was a benefit of $36 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 reflecting favorable equity market and bond fund returns compared to a benefit of $2 million for the prior year period.•An $84 million decrease in auto and home expenses reflecting the impact of new reinsurance arrangements and a lower non-catastrophe loss ratio, partially offset by higher gross catastrophe losses. Catastrophe losses, net of the impact of reinsurance, were $84 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 compared to $89 million for the prior year period. The expanded reinsurance program resulted in ceded losses of approximately $82 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017. •A $57 million expense from loss recognition on LTC insurance products in the third quarter of 2017 primarily due to unfavorable morbidity experience, partially offset by premium increases.•A $24 million increase in expense related to higher reserve funding driven by the impact of higher fees from variable annuity guarantee sales in the prior year where the fees start on the first anniversary date.•A $21 million negative impact from changes in assumptions in the prior year unlocking process that resulted in ongoing increases to living benefit reserves. •A $459 million increase in expense compared to the prior year period from the unhedged nonperformance credit spread risk adjustment on variable annuity guaranteed benefits. As the embedded derivative liability on which the nonperformance credit spread is applied increases (decreases), the impact of the nonperformance credit spread is favorable (unfavorable) to expense. The unfavorable impact of the nonperformance credit spread was $122 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 compared to a favorable impact of $337 million for the prior year period.•A $309 million decrease in expense from other market impacts on variable annuity guaranteed benefits, net of hedges in place to offset those risks and the related DSIC amortization. This decrease was the result of a favorable $1.7 billion change in the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits reserves, an unfavorable $1.4 billion change in the market impact on derivatives hedging the variable annuity guaranteed benefits and a favorable $3 million change in the DSIC offset. The main market drivers contributing to these changes are summarized below:•Interest rate impact on the variable annuity guaranteed living benefits liability net of the impact on the corresponding hedge assets resulted in a lower expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 compared to the prior year period.•Equity market impact on the variable annuity guaranteed living benefits liability net of the impact on the corresponding hedge assets resulted in a benefit for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 compared to an expense in the prior year period.•Volatility impact on the variable annuity guaranteed living benefits liability net of the impact on the corresponding hedge assets resulted in a higher expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 compared to the prior year period.•Other unhedged items, including the difference between the assumed and actual underlying separate account investment performance, fixed income credit exposures, transaction costs and various behavioral items, were a net favorable impact compared to the prior year period.Amortization of DAC decreased $171 million, or 48%, to $189 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 compared to $360 million for the prior year period primarily reflecting the following items:•The impact of unlocking was a benefit of $12 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 compared to an expense of $81 million for the prior year period. The impact of unlocking for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 primarily reflected improved persistency and mortality on life insurance contracts and a $10 million benefit from a correction related to a variable annuity model assumption, partially offset by updates to market-related inputs to the living benefit valuation. The impact of unlocking in the prior year period primarily reflected low interest rates that more than offset benefits from persistency on annuity contracts without living benefits. In addition, we wrote-off $58 million of DAC in connection with the loss recognition on LTC insurance products in the prior year period. •The impact on DAC from actual versus expected market performance based on our view of bond and equity performance was a benefit of $27 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 reflecting favorable equity market and bond fund returns compared to a benefit of $3 million for the prior year period.•The DAC offset to the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits (net of hedges and the related DSIC amortization) was a benefit of $24 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 compared to an expense of $6 million for the prior year period.General and administrative expense increased $23 million, or 1%, to $2.2 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 compared to the prior year period primarily due to higher performance-based compensation, partially offset by a $23 million expense in the prior year period from the resolution of a legacy legal matter related to the hedge fund business.72AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. Income TaxesOur effective tax rate was 19.5% for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 compared to 18.6% for the prior year period.

The impact on DAC, DSIC and reserves for insurance features in non-traditional long-duration contracts from actual versus expected market performance based on our view of bond and equity performance was a benefit of $61 million ($25 million for DAC, $6 million for DSIC and $30 million for insurance features in non-traditional long duration contracts) for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 reflecting favorable equity market and bond fund returns compared to a benefit of $5 million ($3 million for DAC, $1 million for DSIC and $1 million for insurance features in non-traditional long duration contracts) for the prior year period.Net RevenuesNet revenues, which exclude net realized investment gains or losses, increased $15 million, or 1%, to $1.9 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 compared to $1.8 billion for the prior year period due to equity market appreciation and an increase in variable annuity rider fees, partially offset by lower investment yields and net outflows in fixed and variable annuities.Management and financial advice fees increased $24 million, or 4%, to $573 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 compared to $549 million for the prior year period due to higher fees on variable annuities driven by higher average separate account balances. Average variable annuity account balances increased $2.8 billion, or 4%, from the prior year period due to market appreciation, partially offset by net outflows.Net investment income, which excludes net realized investment gains or losses, decreased $46 million, or 8%, to $527 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 compared to $573 million for the prior year period primarily reflecting a decrease of approximately $34 million from lower earned interest rates and approximately $12 million from lower invested assets due to fixed annuity net outflows.Other revenues increased $32 million, or 9%, to $407 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 compared to $375 million for the prior year period due to higher fees from variable annuity guarantee sales in the prior year where the fees start on the first anniversary date and higher average fee rates.ExpensesTotal expenses, which exclude the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits (net of hedges and the related DSIC and DAC amortization) and the DAC and DSIC offset to net realized investment gains or losses, decreased $345 million, or 21%, to $1.3 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 compared to $1.6 billion for the prior year period primarily due to the impact of unlocking. Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses, which exclude the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits (net of hedges and the related DSIC amortization) and the DSIC offset to net realized investment gains or losses, decreased $317 million, or 50%, to $311 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 compared to $628 million for the prior year period primarily reflecting the following items: •The impact of unlocking was a $119 million benefit for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 compared to a $197 million expense for the prior year period. The unlocking impact for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 primarily reflected a benefit from updates to market-related inputs to our living benefit valuation. The unlocking impact for the prior year period primarily reflected low interest rates and an unfavorable impact from persistency on living benefit reserves, partially offset by a benefit from updates to withdrawal utilization and fee assumptions, as well as market-related inputs related to our living benefit valuation. •The impact on DSIC and reserves for insurance features in non-traditional long-duration contracts from actual versus expected market performance based on our view of bond and equity performance was a benefit of $36 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 reflecting favorable equity market and bond fund returns compared to a benefit of $2 million for the prior year period.•A $24 million increase in expense related to higher reserve funding driven by the impact of higher fees from variable annuity guarantee sales in the prior year where the fees start on the first anniversary date.•A $21 million negative impact from changes in assumptions in the prior year unlocking process that resulted in ongoing increases to living benefit reserves.

The impact of unlocking in the prior year period primarily reflected low interest rates that more than offset benefits from persistency on annuity contracts without living benefits. •The impact on DAC from actual versus expected market performance based on our view of bond and equity performance was a benefit of $25 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 reflecting favorable equity market and bond fund returns compared to a benefit of $3 million for the prior year period.•The negative impact on DAC from higher than expected lapses on variable annuities was $14 million.ProtectionThe following table presents the results of operations of our Protection segment on an operating basis: Nine Months Ended September 30, Change2017 2016(in millions)  RevenuesManagement and financial advice fees$35 $38 $(3) (8)%Distribution fees74 72 2 3Net investment income253 247 6 2Premiums896 959 (63) (7)Other revenues258 377 (119) (32)Total revenues1,516 1,693 (177) (10)Banking and deposit interest expense— — — —Total net revenues1,516 1,693 (177) (10)ExpensesDistribution expenses50 50 — —Interest credited to fixed accounts138 130 8 6Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses888 1,015 (127) (13)Amortization of deferred acquisition costs70 107 (37) (35)Interest and debt expense19 18 1 6General and administrative expense182 183 (1) (1)Total expenses1,347 1,503 (156) (10)Operating earnings$169 $190 $(21) (11)%Our Protection segment pretax operating earnings, which excludes net realized investment gains or losses (net of the related DAC amortization, unearned revenue amortization and the reinsurance accrual) and the market impact on indexed universal life benefits (net of hedges and the related DAC amortization, unearned revenue amortization and the reinsurance accrual), decreased $21 million, or 11%, to $169 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 compared to $190 million for the prior year period primarily due to the impact of unlocking and the low interest rate environment, partially offset by improved auto and home results.Net RevenuesNet revenues, which exclude net realized investment gains or losses (net of unearned revenue amortization and the reinsurance accrual) and the unearned revenue amortization and the reinsurance accrual offset to the market impact on indexed universal life benefits, decreased $177 million, or 10%, to $1.5 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 compared to $1.7 billion for the prior year period primarily due to the impact of unlocking and a decrease in premiums.Premiums decreased $63 million, or 7%, to $896 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 compared to $959 million for the prior year period primarily reflecting higher ceded premiums for our auto and home business due to new reinsurance arrangements we entered into at the beginning of the year to reduce risk. Other revenues decreased $119 million, or 32%, to $258 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 compared to $377 million for the prior year period due to the impact of unlocking. Other revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 included a $47 million unfavorable impact from unlocking compared to a $64 million favorable impact in the prior year period. The primary driver of the unlocking impact to other revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 was a negative impact from lower projected gains on reinsurance contracts resulting from favorable mortality experience. The primary driver of the unlocking 79AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. impact to other revenues for the prior year period was a positive impact from higher projected gains on reinsurance contracts resulting from unfavorable mortality experience.ExpensesTotal expenses, which exclude the market impact on indexed universal life benefits (net of hedges and the related DAC amortization) and the DAC offset to net realized investment gains or losses, decreased $156 million, or 10%, to $1.3 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 compared to $1.5 billion for the prior year period due to the impact of unlocking and a decrease in auto and home expenses. Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses decreased $127 million, or 13%, to $888 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 compared to $1.0 billion for the prior year period due to the impact of unlocking and an $84 million decrease in auto and home expenses reflecting the impact of new reinsurance arrangements and a lower non-catastrophe loss ratio, partially offset by higher gross catastrophe losses. The unlocking impact for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 was a $14 million benefit and primarily reflected favorable mortality experience on life insurance contracts. The unlocking impact for the prior year period was a $40 million expense and primarily reflected low interest rates and unfavorable mortality experience. Catastrophe losses, net of the impact of reinsurance, were $84 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 compared to $89 million for the prior year period. The expanded reinsurance program resulted in ceded losses of approximately $82 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017. Amortization of DAC decreased $37 million, or 35%, to $70 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 compared to $107 million for the prior year period primarily reflecting the impact of unlocking, as well as lower DAC amortization on our auto and home business. The unlocking impact for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 was a benefit of $13 million and primarily reflected improved persistency and mortality on life insurance contracts. The unlocking impact for the prior year period was an expense of $7 million.Corporate & OtherThe following table presents the results of operations of our Corporate & Other segment on an operating basis: Nine Months Ended September 30, Change2017 2016(in millions)  RevenuesNet investment income$79 $94 $(15) (16)%Premiums81 81 — —Other revenues4 4 — —Total revenues164 179 (15) (8)Banking and deposit interest expense2 1 1 NMTotal net revenues162 178 (16) (9)ExpensesDistribution expenses(7) (39) 32 82Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses239 219 20 9Amortization of deferred acquisition costs— 63 (63) NMInterest and debt expense20 21 (1) (5)General and administrative expense202 185 17 9Total expenses454 449 5 1Operating loss$(292) $(271) $(21) (8)%NM Not Meaningful.Our Corporate & Other segment pretax operating loss excludes net realized investment gains or losses, the market impact of hedges to offset interest rate changes on unrealized gains or losses for certain investments, integration and restructuring charges, and the impact of consolidating CIEs. Our Corporate & Other segment pretax operating loss increased $21 million, or 8%, to $292 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 compared to $271 million for the prior year period primarily reflecting a decrease in net investment income, an increase in general and administrative expense and LTC loss recognition of $57 million for the third quarter of 2017, partially offset by LTC loss recognition of $31 million in the prior year period and a $29 million increase in LTC reserves in the prior year period from a correction related to our claim utilization assumption.80AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. Net investment income decreased $15 million, or 16%, to $79 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 compared to $94 million for the prior year period primarily due to higher amortization relating to an increase in low income housing investments and the impact of interest allocation between subsidiaries.Distribution expenses increased $32 million to a benefit of $7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 compared to a benefit of $39 million for the prior year period. Distribution expenses for the prior year period included a $27 million benefit related to the write-off of the deferred reinsurance liability in connection with loss recognition on LTC insurance products.Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses increased $20 million, or 9%, to $239 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 compared to $219 million for the prior year period primarily due to a $57 million expense from loss recognition on LTC insurance products in the third quarter of 2017, partially offset by a $29 million increase in LTC reserves in the prior year period from a correction related to our claim utilization assumption. The LTC loss recognition in the third quarter of 2017 was primarily due to unfavorable morbidity experience, partially offset by premium increases. Amortization of DAC decreased $63 million compared to the prior year period reflecting the write-off of DAC in the third quarter of 2016 in connection with the loss recognition on LTC insurance products.General and administrative expense increased $17 million, or 9%, to $202 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 compared to $185 million for the prior year period primarily due to higher performance-based compensation and a $9 million expense related to the renegotiation of a vendor arrangement, partially offset by a $14 million expense in the prior year period from the resolution of a legacy legal matter related to the hedge fund business. Market Risk Our primary market risk exposures are interest rate, equity price, foreign currency exchange rate and credit risk. Equity price and interest rate fluctuations can have a significant impact on our results of operations, primarily due to the effects they have on the asset management and other asset-based fees we earn, the spread income generated on our fixed deferred annuities, fixed insurance, brokerage client cash balances, face-amount certificate products and the fixed portion of our variable annuities and variable insurance contracts, the value of DAC and DSIC assets, the value of liabilities for guaranteed benefits associated with our variable annuities and the value of derivatives held to hedge these benefits.Our earnings from fixed deferred annuities, fixed insurance, and the fixed portion of variable annuities and variable insurance contracts are based upon the spread between rates earned on assets held and the rates at which interest is credited to accounts. We primarily invest in fixed rate securities to fund the rate credited to clients. We guarantee an interest rate to the holders of these products. Investment assets and client liabilities generally differ as it relates to basis, repricing or maturity characteristics. Rates credited to clients’ accounts generally reset at shorter intervals than the yield on the underlying investments. Therefore, in an increasing interest rate environment, higher interest rates may be reflected in crediting rates to clients sooner than in rates earned on invested assets, which could result in a reduced spread between the two rates, reduced earned income and a negative impact on pretax income. However, the current low interest rate environment is resulting in interest rates below the level of some of our liability guaranteed minimum interest rates (“GMIRs”). Hence, a modest rise in interest rates would not necessarily result in changes to all the liability credited rates while projected asset purchases would capture the full increase in interest rates. This dynamic would result in widening spreads under a modestly rising rate scenario given the current relationship between the current level of interest rates and the underlying GMIRs on the business. As a result of the low interest rate environment, our current reinvestment yields are generally lower than the current portfolio yield. We expect our portfolio income yields to continue to decline in future periods if interest rates remain low. The carrying value and weighted average yield of non-structured fixed maturity securities and commercial mortgage loans that may generate proceeds to reinvest through September 30, 2019 due to prepayment, maturity or call activity at the option of the issuer, excluding securities with a make-whole provision, were $4.9 billion and 4.4%, respectively, as of September 30, 2017. In addition, residential mortgage-backed securities, which are subject to prepayment risk as a result of the low interest rate environment, totaled $6.8 billion and had a weighted average yield of 2.7% as of September 30, 2017. While these amounts represent investments that could be subject to reinvestment risk, it is also possible that these investments will be used to fund liabilities or may not be prepaid and will remain invested at their current yields. In addition to the interest rate environment, the mix of benefit payments versus product sales as well as the timing and volumes associated with such mix may impact our investment yield. Furthermore, reinvestment activities and the associated investment yield may also be impacted by corporate strategies implemented at management’s discretion. The average yield for investment purchases during the nine months ended September 30, 2017 was approximately 2.8%.The reinvestment of proceeds from maturities, calls and prepayments at rates below the current portfolio yield, which may be below the level of some liability GMIRs, will have a negative impact to future operating results. To mitigate the unfavorable impact that the low interest rate environment has on our spread income, we assess reinvestment risk in our investment portfolio and monitor this risk in accordance with our asset/liability management framework. In addition, we may reduce the crediting rates on our fixed products when warranted, subject to guaranteed minimums.In addition to the fixed rate exposures noted above, RiverSource Life also has the following variable annuity guarantee benefits: guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits (“GMWB”), guaranteed minimum accumulation benefits (“GMAB”), guaranteed minimum 81AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. death benefits (“GMDB”) and guaranteed minimum income benefits (“GMIB”). Each of these guaranteed benefits guarantees payouts to the annuity holder under certain specific conditions regardless of the performance of the underlying invested assets.The variable annuity guarantees continue to be managed by utilizing a hedging program which attempts to match the sensitivity of the assets with the sensitivity of the liabilities. This approach works with the premise that matched sensitivities will produce a highly effective hedging result. Our comprehensive hedging program focuses mainly on first order sensitivities of assets and liabilities: Equity Market Level (Delta), Interest Rate Level (Rho) and Volatility (Vega). Additionally, various second order sensitivities are managed. We use various index options across the term structure, interest rate swaps and swaptions, total return swaps and futures to manage the risk exposures. The exposures are measured and monitored daily, and adjustments to the hedge portfolio are made as necessary.We have a macro hedge program to provide protection against the statutory tail scenario risk arising from variable annuity reserves on our statutory surplus and to cover some of the residual risks not covered by other hedging activities. We assess the residual risk under a range of scenarios in creating and executing the macro hedge program. As a means of economically hedging these risks, we use a combination of futures, options, interest rate swaptions and/or swaps. Certain of the macro hedge derivatives used contain settlement provisions linked to both equity returns and interest rates; the remaining are interest rate contracts or equity contracts. The macro hedge program could result in additional earnings volatility as changes in the value of the macro hedge derivatives, which are designed to reduce statutory capital volatility, may not be closely aligned to changes in the variable annuity guarantee embedded derivatives.To evaluate interest rate and equity price risk we perform sensitivity testing which measures the impact on pretax income from the sources listed below for a 12-month period following a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates or a hypothetical 10% decline in equity prices. The interest rate risk test assumes a sudden 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve, with rates then staying at those levels for the next 12 months. The equity price risk test assumes a sudden 10% drop in equity prices, with equity prices then staying at those levels for the next 12 months. In estimating the values of variable annuity riders, equity indexed annuities, stock market certificates, indexed universal life insurance and the associated hedge assets, we assume no change in implied market volatility despite the 10% drop in equity prices.The following tables present our estimate of the impact on pretax income from the above defined hypothetical market movements as of September 30, 2017:Equity Price Decline 10% Equity Price Exposure to Pretax IncomeBefore Hedge Impact Hedge Impact Net Impact  (in millions)Asset-based management and distribution fees (1) $(261) $6 $(255)DAC and DSIC amortization (2) (3) (129) — (129)Variable annuity riders:      GMDB and GMIB (3) (29) — (29)GMWB (3) (4) (379) 233 (146)GMAB (25) 26 1DAC and DSIC amortization (4) N/A N/A (3)Total variable annuity riders (433) 259 (177)Macro hedge program (5) — 43 43Equity indexed annuities 1 (1) —Certificates 3 (3) —Indexed universal life insurance 66 (49) 17Total $(753) $255 $(501)82AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC.

This is a significantly more conservative estimate than if we assumed management follows its mean reversion guideline and increased near-term rates to recover the drop in equity values over a five-year period. We make this same conservative assumption in estimating the impact from GMDB and GMIB riders and the life contingent benefits associated with GMWB.(4) Market impact on DAC and DSIC amortization related to variable annuity riders is modeled net of hedge impact.(5) The market impact of the macro hedge program is modeled net of any related impact to DAC and DSIC amortization.The above results compare to an estimated negative net impact to pretax income of $490 million related to a 10% equity price decline and an estimated positive net impact to pretax income of $297 million related to a 100 basis point increase in interest rates as of December 31, 2016. The change in interest rate exposure from December 31, 2016 is primarily the result of changes in market conditions.Net impacts shown in the above table from GMWB and GMAB riders result largely from differences between the liability valuation basis and the hedging basis. Liabilities are valued using fair value accounting principles, with risk margins incorporated in contractholder behavior assumptions and with discount rates increased to reflect a current market estimate of our risk of nonperformance specific to these liabilities. Our hedging is based on our determination of economic risk, which excludes certain items in the liability valuation including the nonperformance spread risk.Actual results could differ materially from those illustrated above as they are based on a number of estimates and assumptions. These include assuming that implied market volatility does not change when equity prices fall by 10%, that management does not increase assumed equity asset growth rates to anticipate recovery of the drop in equity values when valuing DAC, DSIC and GMDB and GMIB liability values and that the 100 basis point increase in interest rates is a parallel shift of the yield curve. Furthermore, we have not tried to anticipate changes in client preferences for different types of assets or other changes in client behavior, nor have we tried to anticipate actions management might take to increase revenues or reduce expenses in these scenarios.The selection of a 100 basis point interest rate increase as well as a 10% equity price decline should not be construed as a prediction of future market events. Impacts of larger or smaller changes in interest rates or equity prices may not be proportional to those shown for a 100 basis point increase in interest rates or a 10% decline in equity prices.Fair Value MeasurementsWe report certain assets and liabilities at fair value; specifically, separate account assets, derivatives, embedded derivatives, properties held by our consolidated property funds, and most investments and cash equivalents. Fair value assumes the exchange of assets or liabilities occurs in orderly transactions and is not the result of a forced liquidation or distressed sale. We include actual market prices, or observable inputs, in our fair value measurements to the extent available. Broker quotes are obtained when quotes from pricing services are not available. We validate prices obtained from third parties through a variety of means such as: price variance analysis, subsequent sales testing, stale price review, price comparison across pricing vendors and due diligence reviews of vendors. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our fair value measurements.83AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. Fair Value of Liabilities and Nonperformance RiskCompanies are required to measure the fair value of liabilities at the price that would be received to transfer the liability to a market participant (an exit price). Since there is not a market for our obligations of our variable annuity riders and indexed universal life insurance, we consider the assumptions participants in a hypothetical market would make to reflect an exit price. As a result, we adjust the valuation of variable annuity riders and indexed universal life insurance by updating certain contractholder assumptions, adding explicit margins to provide for profit, risk and expenses, and adjusting the rates used to discount expected cash flows to reflect a current market estimate of our nonperformance risk. The nonperformance risk adjustment is based on observable market data adjusted to estimate the risk of our life insurance company subsidiaries not fulfilling these liabilities. Consistent with general market conditions, this estimate resulted in a spread over the LIBOR swap curve as of September 30, 2017. As our estimate of this spread widens or tightens, the liability will decrease or increase. If this nonperformance credit spread moves to a zero spread over the LIBOR swap curve, the reduction to net income would be approximately $213 million, net of DAC, DSIC, unearned revenue amortization, the reinsurance accrual and income taxes (calculated at the statutory tax rate of 35%), based on September 30, 2017 credit spreads.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesOverviewWe maintained substantial liquidity during the nine months ended September 30, 2017. At September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, we had $2.4 billion and $2.3 billion, respectively, in cash and cash equivalents excluding CIEs. On October 12, 2017, we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement that provides for an unsecured revolving credit facility of up to $750 million that expires in October 2022. Under the terms of the credit agreement for the facility, we may increase the amount of this facility up to $1.0 billion upon satisfaction of certain approval requirements. This agreement replaced our unsecured revolving credit facility that was to expire in May 2020. At September 30, 2017, we had no outstanding borrowings under this credit facility and had $1 million of outstanding letters of credit. Our credit facility contains various administrative, reporting, legal and financial covenants. We were in compliance with all such covenants at September 30, 2017. We enter into short-term borrowings, which may include repurchase agreements and Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) advances, to reduce reinvestment risk. Short-term borrowings allow us to receive cash to reinvest in longer-duration assets, while paying back the short-term debt with cash flows generated by the fixed income portfolio. The balance of repurchase agreements as of both September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 was $50 million, which is collateralized with agency residential mortgage backed securities and commercial mortgage backed securities from our investment portfolio. Our subsidiary, RiverSource Life Insurance Company (“RiverSource Life”), is a member of the FHLB of Des Moines, which provides access to collateralized borrowings. We had $151 million and $150 million of borrowings from the FHLB, which is collateralized with commercial mortgage backed securities, as of September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. We believe cash flows from operating activities, available cash balances and our availability of revolver borrowings will be sufficient to fund our operating liquidity needs.Dividends from SubsidiariesAmeriprise Financial is primarily a parent holding company for the operations carried out by our wholly owned subsidiaries. Because of our holding company structure, our ability to meet our cash requirements, including the payment of dividends on our common stock, substantially depends upon the receipt of dividends or return of capital from our subsidiaries, particularly our life insurance subsidiary, RiverSource Life, our face-amount certificate subsidiary, Ameriprise Certificate Company (“ACC”), AMPF Holding Corporation, which is the parent company of our retail introducing broker-dealer subsidiary, Ameriprise Financial Services, Inc. (“AFSI”) and our clearing broker-dealer subsidiary, American Enterprise Investment Services, Inc. (“AEIS”), our Auto and Home insurance subsidiary, IDS Property Casualty Insurance Company (“IDS Property Casualty”), doing business as Ameriprise Auto & Home Insurance, our transfer agent subsidiary, Columbia Management Investment Services Corp., our investment advisory company, Columbia Management Investment Advisers, LLC, and Threadneedle Asset Management Holdings Sàrl. The payment of dividends by many of our subsidiaries is restricted and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to regulatory capital requirements.84AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. Actual capital and regulatory capital requirements for our wholly owned subsidiaries subject to regulatory capital requirements were as follows: Actual Capital Regulatory Capital RequirementsSeptember 30, 2017 December 31, 2016September 30, 2017 December 31, 2016 (in millions)RiverSource Life(1)(2)$2,737 $3,052 N/A $606RiverSource Life of NY(1)(2)306 323 N/A 38IDS Property Casualty(1)(3)805 800 $216 213Ameriprise Insurance Company(1)(3)48 47 3 2ACC(4)(5)369 335 341 317Threadneedle Asset Management Holdings Sàrl(6)424 360 169 149Ameriprise National Trust Bank(7)23 22 10 10AFSI(3)(4)126 77 # #Ameriprise Captive Insurance Company(3)54 51 10 9Ameriprise Trust Company(3)30 29 26 24AEIS(3)(4)115 107 21 19RiverSource Distributors, Inc.(3)(4)13 11 # #Columbia Management Investment Distributors, Inc.(3)(4)17 14 # #N/A Not applicable.# Amounts are less than $1 million.(1) Actual capital is determined on a statutory basis.(2) Regulatory capital requirement is based on the statutory risk-based capital filing.(3) Regulatory capital requirement is based on the applicable regulatory requirement, calculated as of September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016.(4) Actual capital is determined on an adjusted GAAP basis.(5) ACC is required to hold capital in compliance with the Minnesota Department of Commerce and SEC capital requirements.(6) Actual capital and regulatory capital requirements are determined in accordance with U.K. regulatory legislation. The regulatory capital requirements at September 30, 2017 represent calculations at December 31, 2016 of the rule based requirements, as specified by FCA regulations.(7) Ameriprise National Trust Bank is required to maintain capital in compliance with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency regulations and policies.Our insurance companies’ statutory capital is calculated in accordance with the accounting practices prescribed or permitted by domiciliary state insurance regulators. RiverSource Life received approval from the Minnesota Department of Commerce to apply a permitted statutory accounting practice, effective July 1, 2017 through June 30, 2018, for certain derivative instruments used to economically hedge the interest rate exposure of certain variable annuity products that do not qualify for statutory hedge accounting. The permitted practice is intended to mitigate the impact to statutory capital from the misalignment between variable annuity statutory reserves, which are not carried at fair value, and the fair value of derivatives used to economically hedge the interest rate exposure of non-life contingent living benefit guarantees. The permitted practice allows RiverSource Life to defer a portion of the change in fair value, net investment income and realized gains or losses generated from designated derivatives to the extent the amounts do not offset the current period interest-rate related change in the variable annuity statutory reserve liability. The deferred amount will be amortized over ten years using the straight-line method with the ability to accelerate amortization at management’s discretion. There was no immediate impact to statutory capital at the effective date for the permitted statutory accounting practice. As of September 30, 2017, application of this permitted practice resulted in a decrease to RiverSource Life’s statutory capital of approximately $21 million.In addition to the particular regulations restricting dividend payments and establishing subsidiary capitalization requirements, we take into account the overall health of the business, capital levels and risk management considerations in determining a dividend strategy for payments to our parent holding company from our subsidiaries, and in deciding to use cash to make capital contributions to our subsidiaries.During the nine months ended September 30, 2017, the parent holding company received cash dividends or a return of capital from its subsidiaries of $1.3 billion (including $700 million from RiverSource Life) and contributed cash to its subsidiaries of $64 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the parent holding company received cash dividends or a return of capital from its subsidiaries of $1.3 billion (including $800 million from RiverSource Life) and contributed cash to its subsidiaries of $135 million (including $75 million to IDS Property Casualty).85AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. In 2009, RiverSource established an agreement to protect its exposure to Genworth Life Insurance Company (“GLIC”) for its reinsured LTC. In 2016, substantial enhancements to this reinsurance protection agreement were finalized. The terms of these confidential provisions within the agreement have been shared, in the normal course of regular reviews, with our domiciliary regulator and rating agencies. Management believes that this agreement and offsetting non LTC legacy arrangements with Genworth will enable RiverSource to recover on all net exposure in the event of an insolvency of GLIC.Dividends Paid to Shareholders and Share Repurchases We paid regular quarterly dividends to our shareholders totaling $379 million and $368 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. On October 24, 2017, we announced a quarterly dividend of $0.83 per common share. The dividend will be paid on November 17, 2017 to our shareholders of record at the close of business on November 6, 2017.In December 2015, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase up to $2.5 billion of our common stock through December 31, 2017, which was exhausted in the third quarter 2017. In April 2017, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase up to an additional $2.5 billion of our common stock through June 30, 2019. As of September 30, 2017, we had $2.4 billion remaining under this share repurchase authorization. We intend to fund share repurchases through existing working capital, future earnings and other customary financing methods. The share repurchase programs do not require the purchase of any minimum number of shares, and depending on market conditions and other factors, these purchases may be commenced or suspended at any time without prior notice. Acquisitions under the share repurchase programs may be made in the open market, through privately negotiated transactions or block trades or other means. During the nine months ended September 30, 2017, we repurchased a total of 8.0 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $129.76 per share.Cash FlowsCash flows of CIEs and restricted and segregated cash are reflected in our cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities, investing activities and financing activities. Cash held by CIEs is not available for general use by Ameriprise Financial, nor is Ameriprise Financial cash available for general use by its CIEs. Cash segregated under federal and other regulations is held for the exclusive benefit of our brokerage customers and is not available for general use by Ameriprise Financial.Operating ActivitiesNet cash provided by operating activities decreased $843 million to $1.2 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 compared to $2.0 billion for the prior year period primarily due to a $186 million increase in income taxes paid, a $148 million decrease in cash from changes in other investments (primarily trading securities), and net cash outflows related to derivatives for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 compared to net cash inflows for the prior year period.Investing ActivitiesOur investing activities primarily relate to our Available-for-Sale investment portfolio. Further, this activity is significantly affected by the net flows of our investment certificate, fixed annuity and universal life products reflected in financing activities.Net cash used in investing activities decreased $261 million to $106 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 compared to $367 million for the prior year period primarily due to a $944 million decrease in cash used for purchases of Available-for-Sale securities and a $204 million increase in proceeds from maturities, sinking fund payments and calls of Available-for-Sale securities, partially offset by a $357 million decrease in proceeds from sales, maturities and repayments of mortgage loans reflecting the sale of a portion of our consumer loans in 2016 and a $242 million decrease in net cash related to changes in investments of CIEs.Financing ActivitiesNet cash used in financing activities increased $713 million to $1.3 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 compared to $573 million for the prior year period primarily due to the issuance of $500 million of long-term debt in 2016 and a $371 million decrease in net cash inflows related to investment certificates, partially offset by a $246 million decrease in repayments of long-term debt.Contractual CommitmentsThere have been no material changes to our contractual obligations disclosed in our 2016 10-K.
