Item 1A. Risk Factors  The vote in the U.K. to leave the European Union could adversely affect us.  Approximately 22% of our brokerage segment and approximately 4% of our risk management segment revenues came from the U.K. in 2015. In a referendum held on June 23, 2016, a majority of voters in the U.K. voted in favor of the U.K. leaving the European Union. This vote to leave has created significant uncertainty regarding the U.K. economic outlook, and could lead to a decline in economic activity, a recession, or reduced future growth prospects in the U.K., any of which could damage our clients’ confidence and materially and adversely affect our business. In addition, in the event of the exit of the U.K. from the European Union, we would likely face new regulatory costs and challenges. For example, our U.K. operations could lose their European Union financial services passport which provides them the license to operate across borders within the single European Union market without obtaining local regulatory approval. Moreover, the vote to leave the European Union may result in substantial volatility in foreign exchange markets and may lead to a sustained weakness in the British pound’s exchange rate against the U.S. dollar. Any significant weakening of the British pound to the U.S. dollar will have an adverse impact on our brokerage and risk management segment revenues and earnings as reported in U.S. dollars. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
