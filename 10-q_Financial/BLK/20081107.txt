Item 1A. Risk Factors  In addition to the risk factors previously disclosed in BlackRock’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2007, BlackRock’s business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of the following risks.  The soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect BlackRock.  Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. We, and the funds and accounts that we manage, have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds, and other institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose us or the funds and accounts that we manage to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client. There is no assurance that any such losses would not materially and adversely impact our revenues and earnings.  The failure or negative performance of products of other financial institutions could lead to reduced AUM in similar products of BlackRock without regard to the performance of BlackRock’s products.  The failure or negative performance of products of other financial institutions could lead to a loss of confidence in similar products of BlackRock without regard to the performance of BlackRock’s products. Such a negative contagion could lead to withdrawals, redemptions and liquidity issues in such products and have a material adverse impact on our AUM, revenues and earnings.    - 61 -    PART II – OTHER INFORMATION (Continued)      Item 2.
