Item 1A. Risk Factors.   In addition to the risk factors relating to M&T that were disclosed in response to Item 1A. to Part I of Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009, the following risk factor could significantly impact M&T’s operations and its financial results:       •   Legislative actions taken now or in the future may have a significant adverse effect on M&T’s operations. A number of regulatory initiatives directed at the financial services industry have been proposed in recent months. One of those initiatives, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the “Dodd-Frank Act”), was signed into law by President Obama on July 21, 2010. The Dodd-Frank Act represents a comprehensive overhaul of the financial services industry within the United States and will require the newly created Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection and other federal agencies to implement many new rules. At this time, it is difficult to predict the extent to which the Dodd-Frank Act or the forthcoming rules and regulations will impact M&T’s business. It is expected, however, that at a minimum they will result in increased costs and therefore may adversely impact M&T’s business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.            Another such initiative relates to the restricted ability of financial institutions to impose overdraft charges on certain customer transactions. Beginning on July 1, 2010 for new customers and August 15, 2010 for existing customers, federal rules prohibit a financial institution from assessing a fee to complete an ATM withdrawal or one- time debit card transaction which will cause an overdraft unless the customer consents in advance. Such rules have resulted in a decline in     - 96 -    Table of Contents          service charges on deposit accounts as discussed in more detail under the caption “Other Income” in Part I, Item 2, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”       Item 2.
