Item 1A. Risk Factors.   For a discussion of risk factors relating to M&T, refer to the response to Item 1A. to Part I of Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2007, as well as to Part I, Item I, “Financial Statements” and Part I, Item 2, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Additional risk factors for M&T include:       •   The significant downturn in the residential real estate market that began in 2007 has continued in 2008. The impact of that downturn has resulted in declining home prices, higher foreclosures and loan charge-offs, and lower market prices on investment securities backed by residential real estate. These factors could negatively impact M&T’s results of operations.        •   Lower demand for M&T’s products and services and lower revenues and earnings could result from an economic recession.        •   Lower fee income from M&T’s brokerage, and trust businesses could result from significant declines in stock market prices.        •   Lower earnings could result from other-than temporary impairment charges related to M&T’s investment securities portfolio.        •   Higher FDIC insurance costs due to bank failures that have caused the FDIC Deposit Insurance Fund to fall below minimum required levels.        •   There is no assurance that the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 will improve the condition of the financial markets.    - 67 -    Table of Contents        Item 2.
