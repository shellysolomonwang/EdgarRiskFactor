Item 1A. Risk Factors — The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act was signed into law on July 21, 2010. This legislation will have an adverse impact on the Company’s financial results upon full implementation. Among other impacts, this legislation establishes a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, changes the base for deposit insurance assessments, introduces regulatory rate-setting for interchange fees charged to merchants for debit card transactions, and excludes certain instruments currently included in determining the Tier 1 regulatory capital ratio. The capital instrument exclusion will be phased-in over a three-year period beginning in 2013. As of September 30, 2010, the instruments subject to that exclusion increase the Company’s Tier 1 capital ratio by 1.4 percent. Most of the legislation’s other provisions require rulemaking by various regulatory agencies. The Company cannot currently quantify the future impact of this legislation and the related future rulemaking, but expects them to have a detrimental impact on revenues and expenses once fully implemented.     There are a number of other factors that may adversely affect the Company’s business, financial results or stock price. Refer to “Risk Factors” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009, for discussion of these risks.      Item 2.
