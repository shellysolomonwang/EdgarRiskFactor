Item 1A. Risk Factors — There are a number of factors, including those specified below, that may adversely affect the Company’s business, financial results or stock price. These risks are described elsewhere in this report or the Company’s other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2007. Additional risks that the Company currently does not know about or currently views as immaterial may also impair the Company’s business or adversely impact its financial results or stock price.     The risks identified in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2007, have not changed in any material respect, except that additional risk factors are added at the end of the list of risk factors under Item 1A to read in its entirety as follows:     Recent Market, Legislative, and Regulatory Events     Difficult market conditions have adversely affected the Company’s industry. Dramatic declines in the housing market over the past year, with falling home prices and increasing foreclosures and unemployment, have negatively impacted the credit performance of real estate related loans and resulted in significant write-downs of asset values by financial institutions. These write-downs, initially of asset-backed securities but spreading to other securities and loans, have caused many financial institutions to seek additional capital, to reduce or eliminate dividends, to merge with larger and stronger institutions and, in some cases, to fail. Reflecting concern about the stability of the financial markets generally and the strength of counterparties, many lenders and institutional investors have reduced or ceased providing funding to borrowers, including to other financial institutions. This market turmoil and tightening of credit have led to an increased level of commercial and consumer delinquencies, lack of consumer confidence, increased market volatility and widespread reduction of business activity generally. The resulting economic pressure on consumers and lack of confidence in the financial markets has already adversely affected the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations. Market developments may affect consumer confidence levels and may cause adverse changes in payment patterns, causing increases in delinquencies and default rates, which may impact the Company’s charge-offs and provision for credit losses. A worsening of these conditions would likely exacerbate the adverse effects of these difficult market conditions on the Company and others in the financial institutions industry.      The Company could experience an unexpected inability to obtain needed liquidity. The Company’s liquidity could be constrained by an inability to access the capital markets due to a variety of unforeseen market dislocations or interruptions. If the Company is unable to meet its funding needs on a timely basis, its business would be adversely affected.      Current levels of market volatility are unprecedented. The market for certain investment securities has become highly volatile or inactive, and may not stabilize or resume in the near term. This volatility can result in significant fluctuations in the prices of those securities, which may affect the Company’s results of operations.      The soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect the Company. The Company’s ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships. The Company has exposure to many different counterparties, and the Company routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds, and other institutional clients. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services institutions, or the financial services industry generally, have led to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by the Company or by other institutions. Many of these transactions expose the Company to credit risk in the event of default of the Company’s counterparty or client. In addition, the Company’s credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by the Company cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the financial instrument exposure due the Company. There is no assurance that any such losses would not materially and adversely affect the Company’s results of operations.               50   U.S. Bancorp       Table of Contents   There can be no assurance that recently enacted legislation will stabilize the U.S. financial markets. On October 3, 2008, President Bush signed into law the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (the “EESA”) which authorizes, among other things, the U.S. Treasury to purchase up to $700 billion of mortgages, mortgage-backed securities and certain other financial instruments from financial institutions for the purpose of stabilizing and providing liquidity to the U.S. financial markets. On October 14, 2008, the U.S. Treasury announced a program under the EESA pursuant to which it would make senior preferred stock investments in participating financial institutions (the “TARP Capital Purchase Program”). Also, on October 14, 2008, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) announced the development of a guarantee program under which the FDIC would offer a guarantee of certain financial institution indebtedness in exchange for an insurance premium to be paid to the FDIC by issuing financial institutions (the “FDIC Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program”).      There can be no assurance, however, that the EESA and its implementing regulations, the FDIC programs, or any other governmental program will have a positive impact on the financial markets. The failure of the EESA, the FDIC, or the U.S. government to stabilize the financial markets and a continuation or worsening of current financial market conditions could materially and adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations, access to credit or the trading price of the Company’s common stock.     The Company may be adversely affected by the recently enacted legislation and actions by the FDIC. The programs established or to be established under the EESA and Troubled Asset Relief Program may adversely affect the Company. The Company may face increased regulation of the Company’s business and increased costs associated with these programs. Also, the Company’s anticipated participation in the TARP Capital Purchase Program limits (without the consent of the Department of Treasury) the Company’s ability to increase the Company’s dividend and to repurchase the Company’s common stock for up to three years. Similarly, programs established by the FDIC, whether or not the Company participates, may have an adverse effect on the Company. Participation in the FDIC Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program likely will require the payment of additional insurance premiums to the FDIC. The Company may be required to pay significantly higher Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation premiums even if the Company does not participate in the FDIC Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program, because market developments have significantly depleted the insurance fund of the FDIC and reduced the ratio of reserves to insured deposits.
