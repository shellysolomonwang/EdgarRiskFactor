Item 1A. Risk Factors — There are a number of factors that may adversely affect the Company’s business, financial results or stock price. The risks identified in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, have not changed in any material respect, except that an additional risk factor is added at the end of the list of Economic and Market Conditions risk factors under Item 1A to read in its entirety as follows:  The Company could be affected by the United Kingdom’s potential withdrawal from the European Union In June 2016, the United Kingdom (“UK”) electorate voted to leave the European Union (“EU”). This referendum was advisory and does not have binding legal effect. In the event that the UK formally notifies the EU of its intention to leave the union (“Brexit”), then the terms of the UK’s withdrawal from, and future relationships with, the EU will be negotiated and legislation implementing the withdrawal must be enacted. The ultimate impact of Brexit and its effects on the Company still remain uncertain and will depend on the terms of withdrawal and the post-Brexit relationships that the UK will negotiate with the EU and other non-EU nations. Increased market volatility and further global economic deterioration resulting from Brexit, or concern about Brexit, could have significant adverse effects on the Company’s businesses, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and capital. In addition, specific impacts from Brexit could include requirements that the Company make certain changes to its European legal structure, operational model, business practices and regulatory authorizations in order to continue servicing customers across Europe; detrimental impacts on revenues and expenses; increased difficulties related to recruitment, retention, and mobility of certain European-based employees; and other adverse impacts on the Company’s business operations.
