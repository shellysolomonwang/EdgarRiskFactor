Item 1A. Risk Factors below.  In certain countries, such as Australia, and in certain member states in Europe, merchants are permitted by law to surcharge card purchases. While surcharging continues to be actively considered in certain jurisdictions, the benefits to customers have not been apparent in countries that have allowed it, and in some cases regulators are addressing concerns about excessive surcharging by merchants. Surcharging, particularly where it disproportionately impacts American Express cardmembers, which is known as    60    Table of Contents  differential surcharging, could have a material adverse effect on the Company if it becomes widespread. In June 2012, the Reserve Bank of Australia announced changes to the Australian surcharging standards beginning March 18, 2013 that will allow the Company and other networks to limit a merchant’s right to surcharge to “the reasonable cost of card acceptance.” In the European Union (the EU), the Consumer Rights Directive, which was adopted by the EU Council of Ministers in October 2011, will prohibit merchants from surcharging card purchases more than the merchants’ cost of acceptance. The EU member states have until December 2013 to transpose the directive into national law.  Although neither a legislative nor regulatory initiative, the settlement by MasterCard and Visa in a U.S. merchant class litigation (which has been given preliminary, but not final, approval by the trial court) requires, among other things, MasterCard and Visa to permit U.S. merchants, subject to certain conditions, to surcharge credit cards, while allowing them to continue to prohibit surcharges on debit card transactions.  Also, other countries in which the Company operates have been considering and in some cases adopting similar legislation and rules that would impose changes on certain practices of card issuers, merchant acquirers and payment networks. Governments in several countries have established or are proposing to establish network regulatory regimes. Broad regulatory oversight over payment networks include in some cases requirements for international card networks to be locally licensed and/or to localize aspects of their operations. The development and enforcement of regulatory regimes may adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our revenues and extend our global network.

of Contents U.S. Card Services  Selected Statistical Information  (continued)        (a)  Return on average segment capital is calculated by dividing (i) one-year period segment income ($2.7 billion and $2.9 billion for the twelve months ended June 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively) by (ii) one-year average segment capital ($8.9 billion and $8.7 billion for the twelve months ended June 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively). Return on average tangible segment capital, a non-GAAP measure, is computed in the same manner as return on average segment capital except the computation of average tangible segment capital, a non-GAAP measure, excludes from average segment capital average goodwill and other intangibles of $357 million and $403 million as of June 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The Company believes that return on average tangible segment capital is a useful measure of the profitability of its business.        (b)  Refer to “Selected Statistical Information” footnote (e) on page 42.        (c)  Net interest yield on cardmember loans, adjusted net interest income, and adjusted average loans are non-GAAP measures. Refer to “Glossary of Selected Terminology” for the definitions of these terms. The Company believes adjusted net interest income and adjusted average loans are useful to investors because they are components of net interest yield on cardmember loans, which provides a measure of profitability of the Company’s cardmember loan portfolio.  Results of Operations for the Three and Six Months Ended June 30, 2013 and 2012  USCS segment income increased $25 million or 3 percent for the three months ended June 30, 2013, as compared to the same period in the prior year. USCS segment income increased $77 million or 5 percent for the six months ended June 30, 2013, as compared to the same period in the prior year.  Total revenues net of interest expense increased $202 million or 5 percent and $400 million or 5 percent for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013, respectively, as compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily driven by higher discount revenue, increased net interest income and higher net card fees, partially offset by a decrease in other revenues.  Discount revenue, net card fees and other revenues increased $138 million or 5 percent and $262 million or 5 percent for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013, respectively, as compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily due to higher discount revenue resulting from billed business growth and higher net card fees, partially offset by lower other revenues as a result of cardmember reimbursements. Billed business for both the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 increased 8 percent, primarily driven by a 5 percent increase in average spending per proprietary basic cards-in-force in both periods as compared to the same periods in the prior year.  Interest income increased $52 million or 4 percent and $124 million or 5 percent for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013, respectively, as compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily due to a 4 percent increase in average cardmember loans and higher net interest yield on cardmember loans for both periods, as compared to the same periods in the prior year.  Provisions for losses increased $90 million or 29 percent and $127 million or 21 percent for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013, respectively, as compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily reflecting lower cardmember lending reserve releases during 2013, partially offset by the benefit of lower net write-offs. Refer to the USCS Selected Statistical Information table for the lending and charge net write-off rates.  Expenses increased $86 million or 3 percent and $157 million or 3 percent for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013, respectively, as compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily due to higher marketing, promotion, rewards and cardmember services expenses.  Marketing, promotion, rewards and cardmember services expenses increased $169 million or 11 percent and $242 million or 8 percent for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013, respectively, as compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily reflecting higher cardmember rewards expenses and higher marketing and promotion expenses.    64    Table of Contents For the three and six months ended June 30, 2013, cardmember rewards expense increased $126 million or 12 percent and $186 million or 9 percent, respectively, as compared to the same periods in the prior year. Membership Rewards expense increased approximately $43 million and $35 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013, respectively, as compared to the same periods in the prior year.  These increases reflect higher spending volumes and increases in the URR assumptions net of decreases in the WAC assumptions. Co-brand expense increased approximately $83 million and $151 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year due to higher spending volumes.  Salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses decreased $83 million or 8 percent and $85 million or 4 percent for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013, respectively, as compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily driven by prior year higher other expenses related to accruals for cardmember reimbursements.

Information  (continued)        (a)  Return on average segment capital is calculated by dividing (i) one-year period segment income ($645 million and $748 million for the twelve months ended June 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively) by (ii) one-year average segment capital ($2.9 billion and $2.9 billion for the twelve months ended June 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively). Return on average tangible segment capital, a non-GAAP measure, is computed in the same manner as return on average segment capital except the computation of average tangible segment capital, a non-GAAP measure, excludes from average segment capital average goodwill and other intangibles of $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion as of June 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The Company believes that return on average tangible segment capital is a useful measure of the profitability of its business.      (b)  Refer to “Selected Statistical Information” footnote (e) on page 42.      (c)  Net interest yield on cardmember loans, adjusted net interest income, and adjusted average loans are non-GAAP measures. Refer to “Glossary of Selected Terminology” for the definitions of these terms. The Company believes adjusted net interest income and adjusted average loans are useful to investors because they are components of net interest yield on cardmember loans, which provides a measure of profitability of the Company’s cardmember loan portfolio.  Results of Operations for the Three and Six Months Ended June 30, 2013 and 2012  ICS segment income increased $30 million or 17 percent and $11 million or 3 percent for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013, respectively, as compared to the same periods in the prior year. Changes to revenues, expenses and income were all impacted by a stronger dollar in 2013, as compared to the same period in the prior year.  Total revenues net of interest expense for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 increased $2 million or relatively flat and $20 million or 1 percent, respectively, as compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily due to higher discount revenue, net card fees and other revenues, partially offset by a decrease in net interest income. Assuming no changes in foreign exchange rates, total revenues net of interest expense increased 3 percent and 4 percent for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013, respectively, as compared to the same periods in the prior year.2  Discount revenue, net card fees and other revenues increased $11 million or 1 percent for the three months ended June 30, 2013, as compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to higher other commissions and fees, net card fees and discount revenue, partially offset by other revenues. Discount revenue, net card fees and other revenues increased $29 million or 1 percent for the six months ended June 30, 2013, as compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to an increase in net card fees, higher Loyalty Partner commissions and fees and higher conversion revenue. Assuming no changes in foreign exchange rates, discount revenue, net card fees and other revenues increased 4 percent for both the three and six months ended June 30, 2013, as compared to the same period in the prior year.2  Billed business for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 increased 3 percent and 2 percent, respectively, due to an increase in average spending per proprietary basic cards-in-force and the number of total cards-in-force, as compared to the same periods in the prior year. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2013, assuming no changes in foreign exchange rates, billed business increased 6 percent and 5 percent, respectively, and average spending per proprietary basic cards-in-force increased 6 percent and 5 percent, respectively. Refer to the Consolidated Selected Statistical Information tables on pages 44 and 47 for additional information on billed business by region.          2  The foreign currency adjusted information, a non-GAAP measure, assumes a constant exchange rate between the periods being compared for purposes of currency translation into U.S. dollars (i.e., assumes the foreign exchange rates used to determine results for the three or six months ended June 30, 2013 apply to the periods against which such results are being compared). The Company believes the presentation of information on a foreign currency adjusted basis is helpful to investors by making it easier to compare the Company’s performance in one period to that of another period without the variability caused by fluctuations in currency exchange rates.    67    Table of Contents Interest income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 decreased $17 million or 6 percent and $20 million or 4 percent, respectively, as compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily due to cardmember reimbursements.  Interest expense for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 decreased $8 million or 8 percent and $11 million or 6 percent, respectively, as compared to the same periods in the prior year, reflecting a lower effective cost of funds.  Provisions for losses for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 increased $22 million or 23 percent and $63 million or 43 percent, respectively, as compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily driven by a higher provision for charge cards and lower reserve releases for cardmember lending. Refer to the ICS Selected Statistical Information table for the lending and charge net write-off rates.  Expenses for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 decreased $30 million or 3 percent and $50 million or 2 percent, respectively, as compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily due to lower salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses.  Marketing, promotion, rewards and cardmember services expenses increased $3 million or 1 percent for the three months ended June 30, 2013, as compared to the same period in the prior year, driven by higher cardmember services expenses and rewards costs. Marketing, promotion, rewards and cardmember services expenses decreased $6 million or 1 percent for the six months ended June 30, 2013, as compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to lower rewards costs, partially offset by higher cardmember services expenses.  Salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 decreased $33 million or 6 percent and $44 million or 4 percent, respectively, as compared to the same periods in the prior year, driven by lower other operating expenses.  The effective tax rate in all periods reflected the recurring permanent tax benefit related to the segment’s ongoing funding activities outside the United States, which is allocated to ICS under the Company’s internal tax allocation process. The effective tax rate for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 also reflected the allocated share of tax benefits related to the resolution of certain prior years’ tax items. In addition the effective tax rate for the six months ended June 30, 2013 reflected an additional benefit due to the renewal by the U.S. Congress of the active financing legislation on January 2, 2013. The effective tax rate for the three and six months ended June 30, 2012 reflected the allocated share of tax benefits related to the realization of certain foreign tax credits.    68    Table of Contents Global Commercial Services  Selected Income Statement Data                                                           Three Months Ended June 30,       Six Months Ended June 30,           (Millions, except percentages)     2013       2012       Change     2013       2012       Change   Revenues                                       Discount revenue, net card fees and other   $ 1,290     $ 1,284     $ 6     — %   $ 2,510     $ 2,500     $ 10      — %                                                                       Interest income     3       2       1      50      6       5       1      20    Interest expense     62       65       (3 )     (5)      122       127       (5 )     (4)                                                                        Net interest expense     (59 )      (63 )      4      (6)      (116 )      (122 )      6      (5)                                                                        Total revenues net of interest expense     1,231       1,221       10      1      2,394       2,378       16      1    Provisions for losses     45       36       9      25      82       71       11      15                                                                        Total revenues net of interest expense after provisions for losses     1,186       1,185       1     —      2,312       2,307       5      —                                                                        Expenses                                       Marketing, promotion, rewards and cardmember services     144       138       6      4      294       292       2      1    Salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses     709       748       (39 )     (5)      1,402       1,472       (70 )     (5)                                                                        Total expenses     853       886       (33 )     (4)      1,696       1,764       (68 )     (4)                                                                        Pretax segment income     333       299       34      11      616       543       73      13    Income tax provision     107       80       27      34      199       147       52      35                                                                        Segment income   $ 226     $ 219     $ 7      3 %   $ 417     $ 396     $ 21      5 %                                                                       Effective tax rate     32.1 %      26.8 %              32.3 %      27.1 %                 Selected Statistical Information                                                   As of or for the Three Months Ended June 30,         As of or for the Six Months Ended June 30,           (Millions, except percentages and where indicated)     2013       2012       Change     2013       2012       Change   Card billed business (billions)   $ 44.4     $ 42.3      5 %   $ 87.2     $ 83.8      4 %   Total cards-in-force     7.0       7.0     — %     7.0       7.0     — %   Basic cards-in-force     7.0       7.0     — %     7.0       7.0     — %   Average basic cardmember spending (dollars)*   $ 6,317     $ 6,042      5 %   $ 12,425     $ 11,962      4 %   Global Corporate Travel:                             Travel sales   $ 4,954     $ 5,072      (2)%   $ 9,607     $ 9,917      (3)%   Travel commissions and fees/sales     7.9 %      8.1 %         7.7 %      7.6 %       Total segment assets (billions)   $ 20.5     $ 20.0      3 %   $ 20.5     $ 20.0      3 %   Segment capital   $ 3,680     $ 3,616      2 %   $ 3,680     $ 3,616      2 %   Return on average segment capital(a)     18.3 %      21.1 %         18.3 %      21.1 %       Return on average tangible segment capital(a)     35.9 %      42.3 %         35.9 %      42.3 %       Cardmember receivables:                             Total receivables (billions)   $ 15.9     $ 15.0      6 %   $ 15.9     $ 15.0      6 %   90 days past billing as a % of total     0.7 %      0.6 %         0.7 %      0.6 %       Net loss ratio (as a % of charge volume)     0.08 %      0.06 %         0.08 %      0.07 %                  *  Proprietary cards only.

Return on average tangible segment capital, a non-GAAP measure, is computed in the same manner as return on average segment capital except the computation of average tangible segment capital, a non-GAAP measure, excludes from average segment capital average goodwill and other intangibles of $1.8 billion for both the twelve months ended June 30, 2013 and 2012. The Company believes that return on average tangible segment capital is a useful measure of the profitability of its business.    69    Table of Contents Results of Operations for the Three and Six Months Ended June 30, 2013 and 2012  GCS segment income increased $7 million or 3 percent for the three months ended June 30, 2013, as compared to the same period in the prior year. For the six months ended June 30, 2013, segment income increased $21 million or 5 percent, as compared to the same period in the prior year.  Total revenues net of interest expense increased $10 million or 1 percent and $16 million or 1 percent for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013, respectively, as compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily due to higher discount revenue, net card fees and other revenues.  Discount revenue, net card fees and other revenues for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013, increased $6 million and $10 million respectively, as compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily due to higher discount revenue resulting from an increased level of cardmember spending, partially offset by lower travel commissions and fees. Billed business for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 increased 5 percent and 4 percent, respectively, primarily driven by a 5 percent and 4 percent increase in average spending per proprietary basic cards-in-force, respectively, as compared to the same periods in the prior year.  Billed business increased 7 percent within the United States for both the three and six months ended June 30, 2013. Assuming no changes in foreign exchange rates, billed business increased 2 percent and 1 percent outside the United States for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013, respectively.3  Interest expense decreased $3 million or 5 percent and $5 million or 4 percent for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013, respectively, as compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily driven by a lower effective cost of funds, partially offset by increased funding requirements due to higher average cardmember receivables balances.  Provisions for losses increased $9 million or 25 percent and $11 million or 15 percent for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2013, respectively, as compared to the same periods in the prior year. Refer to the GCS Selected Statistical Information table for the charge card net loss ratio as a percentage of charge volume.  Expenses decreased $33 million or 4 percent and $68 million or 4 percent for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013, respectively, as compared to the same periods in the prior year. Marketing, promotion, rewards and cardmember services expenses increased $6 million or 4 percent and $2 million or 1 percent for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013, respectively, as compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily reflecting higher rewards costs, partially offset by lower marketing and promotion costs.  Salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses decreased $39 million and $70 million or 5 percent for both the three and six months ended June 30, 2013, as compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily due to lower payroll and benefit costs, lower restructuring charges and other operating expenses.        3  Refer to footnote 2 on page 67 relating to changes in foreign exchange rates.    70    Table of Contents The effective tax rate for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 reflected the allocated share of tax benefits related to the resolution of certain prior years’ tax items while the effective tax rate for the three and six months ended June 30, 2012 reflected the allocated share of tax benefits related to the realization of certain foreign tax credits.

Return on average tangible segment capital, a non-GAAP measure, is computed in the same manner as return on average segment capital except the computation of average tangible segment capital, a non-GAAP measure, excludes from average segment capital average goodwill and other intangibles of $199 million and $207 million as of June 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The Company believes that return on average tangible segment capital is a useful measure of the profitability of its business.  Results of Operations for the Three and Six Months Ended June 30, 2013 and 2012  GNMS segment income increased $40 million or 11 percent and $56 million or 8 percent for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013, respectively, as compared to the same periods in the prior year.    71    Table of Contents Total revenues net of interest expense increased $61 million or 5 percent and $116 million or 5 percent for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013, respectively, as compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily due to increased discount revenue, net card fees and other revenues.  Discount revenue, net card fees and other revenues increased $54 million or 4 percent and $102 million or 4 percent for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013, respectively, as compared to the same periods in the prior year. The increase reflects higher merchant-related revenues, driven by the 7 percent increase in global card billed business for both the three and six months ended June 30, 2013, as well as higher GNS revenues.  Interest expense credit increased $4 million or 7 percent and $8 million or 7 percent for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013, respectively, as compared to the same periods in the prior year, due to a higher funding-driven interest credit related to internal transfer pricing, which recognizes the merchant services’ accounts payable-related funding benefit.  Expenses decreased $29 million or 4 percent for the three months ended June 30, 2013, as compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to lower salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses and lower marketing and promotion expenses. Expenses decreased $19 million or 1 percent for the six months ended June 30, 2013, as compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to lower marketing, promotion, rewards and cardmember services, partially offset by higher salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses.  Marketing, promotion, rewards and cardmember services expenses decreased $12 million or 6 percent and $26 million or 7 percent for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013, respectively, as compared to the same periods in the prior year, reflecting lower marketing and promotion expenses.  Salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses decreased $17 million or 3 percent for three months ended June 30, 2013, as compared to the same period in prior year, due to lower salaries and employee benefits costs and other operating expenses and increased $7 million or 1 percent for the six months ended June 30, 2013, as compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to higher professional services expenses and salaries and employee benefits.  Corporate & Other  Results of Operations for the Three and Six Months Ended June 30, 2013 and 2012  Corporate & Other had net expense of $184 million and $148 million for the three months ended June 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The increase in net expense for the three months ended June 30, 2013, as compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily was a result of the favorable effects in the second quarter of 2012 of revised estimates of the liability for uncashed Travelers Cheques in certain international markets.  Corporate & Other had net expense of $450 million and $375 million for the six months ended June 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The increase in net expense for the six months ended June 30, 2013, as compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily was a result of the favorable effects in 2012 of revised estimates of the liability for uncashed Travelers Cheques in certain international markets.  Results for all periods disclosed also included net interest expense related to maintaining the liquidity pool discussed in “Consolidated Capital Resources and Liquidity – Liquidity Management” above, as well as interest expense related to other corporate indebtedness.    72    Table of Contents OTHER REPORTING MATTERS  Glossary of Selected Terminology  Adjusted average loans — Represents average cardmember loans excluding the impact of deferred card fees, net of direct acquisition costs of cardmember loans and certain other immaterial items.  Adjusted net interest income — Represents net interest income attributable to the Company’s cardmember loans portfolio excluding the impact of interest expense and interest income not attributable to the Company’s cardmember loan portfolio.  Asset securitizations — Asset securitization involves the transfer and sale of receivables or loans to a special-purpose entity created for the securitization activity, typically a trust. The trust, in turn, issues securities, commonly referred to as asset-backed securities, that are secured by the transferred receivables or loans. The trust uses the proceeds from the sale of such securities to pay the purchase price for the underlying receivables or loans. The receivables and loans of the Company’s Charge and Lending Trusts being securitized are reported as assets on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets, while the related securities issued to third-party investors are reported as long-term debt.  Average discount rate — This calculation is designed to reflect pricing at merchants accepting general purpose American Express cards. It represents the percentage of billed business (both proprietary and GNS) retained by the Company from merchants it acquires, prior to payments to third parties unrelated to merchant acceptance.  Basel III supplementary leverage ratio – Refer to the Capital Strategy section under “Consolidated Capital Resources and Liquidity” for the definition.  Basic cards-in-force — Proprietary basic consumer cards-in-force includes basic cards issued to the primary account owner and does not include additional supplemental cards issued on that account. Proprietary basic small business and corporate cards-in-force include basic and supplemental cards issued to employee cardmembers. Non-proprietary basic cards-in-force includes cards that are issued and outstanding under network partnership agreements, except for supplemental cards and retail co-brand cardmember accounts which have no out-of-store spend activity during the prior 12-month period.  Billed business — Includes activities (including cash advances) related to proprietary cards, cards issued under network partnership agreements (non-proprietary billed business), corporate payments and certain insurance fees charged on proprietary cards. In-store spend activity within retail co-brand portfolios in GNS, from which the Company earns no revenue, is not included in non-proprietary billed business. Card billed business is reflected in the United States or outside the United States based on where the cardmember is domiciled.  Capital asset pricing model — Generates an appropriate discount rate using internal and external inputs to value future cash flows based on the time value of money and the price for bearing uncertainty inherent in an investment.  Capital ratios — Represents the minimum standards established by the regulatory agencies as a measure to determine whether the regulated entity has sufficient capital to absorb on- and off-balance sheet losses beyond current loss accrual estimates.  Card acquisition — Primarily represents the issuance of new cards to either new or existing cardmembers through marketing and promotion efforts.  Cardmember — The individual holder of an issued American Express branded charge or credit card.    73    Table of Contents Cardmember loans — Represents the outstanding amount due from cardmembers for charges made on their American Express credit cards, as well as any interest charges and card-related fees. Cardmember loans also include balances with extended payment terms on certain American Express charge card products and are net of deferred card fees.  Cardmember receivables — Represents the outstanding amount due from cardmembers for charges made on their American Express charge cards as well as any card-related fees.  Charge cards — Represents cards that generally carry no pre-set spending limits and are primarily designed as a method of payment and not as a means of financing purchases. Charge cardmembers generally must pay the full amount billed each month. No finance charges are assessed on charge cards. Each charge card transaction is authorized based on its likely economics reflecting a customer’s most recent credit information and spend patterns. Some charge card accounts have an additional lending-on-charge feature that allows revolving certain balances.  Credit cards — Represents cards that have a range of revolving payment terms, grace periods, and rate and fee structures.  Discount revenue — Represents revenue earned from fees generally charged to merchants with whom the Company has entered into a card acceptance agreement for processing cardmember transactions. The discount fee generally is deducted from the Company’s payment reimbursing the merchant for cardmember purchases. Discount revenue is reduced by payments made to third-party card issuing partners, cash-back reward costs, corporate incentive payments and other contra-revenue items.  Four-party network — A payment network, such as Visa or MasterCard, in which the card issuer and merchant acquirer are different entities and the network does not have direct relationships with merchants or cardholders.  Interest expense — Interest expense includes interest incurred primarily to fund cardmember loans, charge card product receivables, general corporate purposes, and liquidity needs, and is recognized as incurred. Interest expense is divided principally into two categories: (i) deposits, which primarily relates to interest expense on deposits taken from customers and institutions and (ii) long-term debt, which primarily relates to interest expense on the Company’s long-term financing and short-term borrowings, which primarily relates to interest expense on commercial paper, federal funds purchased, bank overdrafts and other short-term borrowings.  Interest income — Interest income includes (i) interest on loans, (ii) interest and dividends on investment securities and (iii) interest income on deposits with banks and others.  Interest on loans — is assessed using the average daily balance method for owned loans. Unless the loan is classified as non-accrual, interest is recognized based upon the principal amount outstanding in accordance with the terms of the applicable account agreement until the outstanding balance is paid or written off.  Interest and dividends on investment securities — primarily relates to the Company’s performing fixed-income securities. Interest income is accrued as earned using the effective interest method, which adjusts the yield for security premiums and discounts, fees and other payments, so that the related investment security recognizes a constant rate of return on the outstanding balance throughout its term. These amounts are recognized until these securities are in default or when it is likely that future interest payments will not be made as scheduled.    74    Table of Contents Interest income on deposits with banks and other — is recognized as earned, and primarily relates to the placement of cash in excess of near-term funding requirements in interest-bearing time deposits, overnight sweep accounts, and other interest bearing demand and call accounts.  Merchant acquisition — Represents the signing of merchants to accept American Express-branded cards.  Net card fees — Represents the card membership fees earned during the period. These fees are recognized as revenue over the covered card membership period (typically one year), net of provision for projected refunds for cancellation of card membership.  Net interest yield on cardmember loans — Net interest yield on cardmember loans is computed by dividing adjusted net interest income by adjusted average loans, computed on an annualized basis. The calculation of net interest yield on cardmember loans includes interest that is deemed uncollectible. For all presentations of net interest yield on cardmember loans, reserves and net write-offs related to uncollectible interest are recorded through provisions for losses — cardmember loans; therefore, such reserves and net write-offs are not included in the net interest yield calculation.  Net loss ratio — Represents the ratio of charge card write-offs consisting of principal (resulting from authorized and unauthorized transactions) and fee components, less recoveries, on cardmember receivables expressed as a percentage of gross amounts billed to cardmembers.  Net write-off rate — principal only — Represents the amount of cardmember loans or USCS cardmember receivables written off consisting of principal (resulting from authorized transactions), less recoveries, as a percentage of the average loan balance or USCS average receivables during the period.  Net write-off rate — principal, interest and fees — Includes, in the calculation of the net write-off rate, amounts for interest and fees in addition to principal for cardmember loans, and fees in addition to principal for cardmember receivables.  Operating expenses — Represents salaries and employee benefits, professional services, occupancy and equipment, communications and other expenses.  Return on average equity — Calculated by dividing one-year period net income by one-year average total shareholders’ equity.  Return on average segment capital — Calculated by dividing one-year period segment income by one-year average segment capital.  Return on average tangible segment capital — Computed in the same manner as return on average segment capital except the computation of average tangible segment capital excludes from average segment capital average goodwill and other intangibles.  Risk-weighted assets — Refer to the Capital Strategy section under “Consolidated Capital Resources and Liquidity” for the definitions under Basel I and Basel III.  Segment capital — Represents the capital allocated to a segment based upon specific business operational needs, risk measures, and regulatory capital requirements.  Stored value and prepaid products — Includes Travelers Cheques and other prepaid products such as gift cheques and cards as well as reloadable Travelers Cheque cards. These products are sold as safe and convenient alternatives to currency for purchasing goods and services.    75    Table of Contents Three-party network — A payment network, such as American Express, that acts as both the card issuer and merchant acquirer.  Tier 1 common risk-based capital ratio — Refer to the Capital Strategy section under “Consolidated Capital Resources and Liquidity” for the definitions under Basel I and Basel III.  Tier 1 leverage ratio — Refer to the Capital Strategy section under “Consolidated Capital Resources and Liquidity” for the definitions under Basel I and Basel III.  Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio — Refer to the Capital Strategy section under “Consolidated Capital Resources and Liquidity” for the definitions under Basel I and Basel III.  Total cards-in-force — Represents the number of cards that are issued and outstanding. Non-proprietary cards-in-force includes all cards that are issued and outstanding under network partnership agreements, except for retail co-brand cardmember accounts which have no out-of-store spend activity during the prior 12-month period.  Total risk-based capital ratio — Refer to the Capital Strategy section under “Consolidated Capital Resources and Liquidity” for the definition.  Travel sales — Represents the total dollar amount of travel transaction volume for airline, hotel, car rental, and other travel arrangements made for consumers and corporate clients. The Company earns revenue on these transactions by charging a transaction or management fee.  ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  Market risk is the risk to earnings or value resulting from movements in market prices. The Company’s market risk exposure is primarily generated by interest rate risk in its card, insurance and Travelers Cheque businesses, as well as its investment portfolios, and foreign exchange risk in its operations outside the United States. As described in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012 (refer to “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk”):        •    the detrimental effect on the Company’s annual net interest income of a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would be approximately $223 million; and        •    the adverse impact on pretax income of a hypothetical 10 percent strengthening of the U.S. dollar related to anticipated overseas operating results for the next 12 months would be approximately $187 million.  These sensitivities are based on the 2012 year-end positions, and assume that all relevant maturities and types of interest rates and foreign exchange rates that affect the Company’s results would increase instantaneously and simultaneously and to the same degree. There were no material changes in these market risks since December 31, 2012.  ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  The Company’s management, with the participation of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on such evaluation, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of such period, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective and designed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded,    76    Table of Contents  processed, summarized and reported within the requisite time periods specified in the applicable rules and forms, and that it is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  There have not been any changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the fiscal quarter to which this report relates that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.  Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-looking Statements  This report includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. The forward-looking statements, which address the Company’s expected business and financial performance, among other matters, contain words such as “believe,” “expect,” “estimate,” “anticipate,” “optimistic,” “intend,” “plan,” “aim,” “will,” “may,” “should,” “could,” “would,” “likely,” and similar expressions. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date on which they are made. The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements, include, but are not limited to, the following:        •    the ability to hold annual operating expense growth to less than 3 percent for the next two years, which will depend in part on the Company’s ability to achieve the expected benefits of the Company’s restructuring plan, which will be impacted by, among other things, the factors identified below, the Company’s ability to balance the control and management of expenses and the maintenance of competitive service levels for its customers, unanticipated increases in significant categories of operating expenses, such as consulting or professional fees, compliance or regulatory-related costs and technology costs, the payment of monetary damages and penalties, disgorgement and restitution, the Company’s decision to increase or decrease discretionary operating expenses depending on overall business performance, the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on costs and results, the impact of accounting changes and the level of acquisition activity and related expenses;        •    the actual amount to be spent by the Company on investments in the business, including on marketing, promotion, rewards and cardmember services and certain operating expenses, as well as the actual amount of resources arising from the restructuring plan the Company decides to invest in growth initiatives, which will be based in part on management’s assessment of competitive opportunities and the Company’s performance and the ability to control and manage operating, infrastructure, advertising, promotion and rewards expenses as business expands or changes, including the changing behavior of cardmembers;        •    changes affecting the Company’s ability or desire to repurchase up to $1.8 billion of its common shares for the remainder of 2013 and up to $1.0 billion in the first quarter of 2014, such as acquisitions, results of operations, capital needs and the amount of shares issued by the Company to employees upon the exercise of options, among other factors, which will significantly impact the potential decrease in the Company’s capital ratios;        •    the possibility of not achieving the expected timing and financial impact of the Company’s restructuring plan and higher than expected employee levels, which could be caused by factors such as the Company’s ability to mitigate the operational and other risks posed by planned staff reductions, the Company’s ability to develop and implement technology resources to realize cost savings, underestimating hiring needs related to some of the job positions being eliminated and other employee needs not currently anticipated, lower than expected attrition rates and higher than expected redeployment rates;    77    Table of Contents     •    the ability of the Company to meet its on-average and over-time growth targets for revenues net of interest expense, earnings per share and return on average equity, which will depend on factors such as the Company’s success in implementing its strategies and initiatives including growing the Company’s share of overall spending, increasing merchant coverage, enhancing its pre-paid offerings, expanding the GNS business and expense management, and on factors outside management’s control including the willingness of cardmembers to sustain spending, the effectiveness of marketing and loyalty programs, regulatory and market pressures on pricing, credit trends, currency and interest rate fluctuations, and changes in general economic conditions, such as GDP growth, consumer confidence, unemployment and the housing market;        •    the ability of the Company to meet its on-average and over-time objective to return 50 percent of capital generated to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, which will depend on factors such as approval of the Company’s capital plans by its primary regulators, the amount the Company spends on acquisitions, the Company’s results of operations and capital needs in any given period, and the amount of shares issued by the Company to employees upon the exercise of options;        •    changes in global economic and business conditions, including consumer and business spending, the availability and cost of credit, unemployment and political conditions, all of which may significantly affect spending on American Express cards, delinquency rates, loan balances and other aspects of the Company’s business and results of operations;        •    changes in capital and credit market conditions, including sovereign creditworthiness, which may significantly affect the Company’s ability to meet its liquidity needs, access to capital and cost of capital, including changes in interest rates; changes in market conditions affecting the valuation of the Company’s assets; or any reduction in the Company’s credit ratings or those of its subsidiaries, which could materially increase the cost and other terms of the Company’s funding, restrict its access to the capital markets or result in contingent payments under contracts;        •    litigation, such as class actions or proceedings brought by governmental and regulatory agencies (including the lawsuit filed against the Company by the U.S. Department of Justice and certain state attorneys general), that could result in (i) the imposition of behavioral remedies against the Company or the Company voluntarily making certain changes to its business practices, the effects of which in either case could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial performance; (ii) the imposition of substantial monetary damages and penalties, disgorgement and restitution; and/or (iii) damage to the Company’s global reputation and brand;        •    legal and regulatory developments wherever the Company does business, including legislative and regulatory reforms in the United States, such as the establishment of the CFPB and Dodd-Frank’s stricter regulation of large, interconnected financial institutions, which could make fundamental changes to many of the Company’s business practices or materially affect its capital requirements, results of operations, or ability to pay dividends or repurchase its stock; actions and potential future actions by the FDIC and credit rating agencies applicable to securitization trusts, which could impact the Company’s ABS program; or potential changes to the taxation of the Company’s businesses, the allowance of deductions for significant expenses, or the incidence of consumption taxes on the Company’s transactions, products and services;        •    changes in the substantial and increasing worldwide competition in the payments industry, including competitive pressure that may impact the prices the Company charges merchants that accept the Company’s cards and the success of marketing, promotion or rewards programs;        •    changes in the financial condition and creditworthiness of the Company’s business partners, such as bankruptcies, restructurings or consolidations, involving merchants that represent a significant portion    78    Table of Contents       of the Company’s business, such as the airline industry, or the Company’s partners in GNS or financial institutions that the Company relies on for routine funding and liquidity, which could materially affect the Company’s financial condition or results of operations;        •    the impact of final laws and regulations, if any, arising from the European Commission’s Green Paper on the payments industry, which will depend on various factors, including, but not limited to, the issues presented and decisions made in the European legislative and regulatory processes addressing the proposed regulation of interchange fees and other practices related to card-based payment transactions, the amount of time these processes take to reach completion, and the actual pricing and other requirements ultimately adopted in the final laws and regulations in the European Union and its member countries;        •    the ability of the Company to maintain and expand its presence in the digital payments space, including online and mobile channels, which will depend on the Company’s success in evolving its business models and processes for the digital environment, building partnerships and executing programs with companies, and utilizing digital capabilities that can be leveraged for future growth; and        •    factors beyond the Company’s control such as fire, power loss, disruptions in telecommunications, severe weather conditions, natural disasters, terrorism, cyber attacks or fraud, which could significantly affect spending on American Express cards, delinquency rates, loan balances and travel-related spending or disrupt the Company’s global network systems and ability to process transactions.  A further description of these uncertainties and other risks can be found in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012 and its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2013.  PART II. OTHER INFORMATION  ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS  The Company and its subsidiaries are involved in a number of legal and arbitration proceedings, including class actions, arising out of the conduct of their respective business activities. The Company believes it has meritorious defenses to each of these actions and intends to defend them vigorously. In the course of its business, the Company and its subsidiaries are also subject to governmental examinations, information gathering requests, subpoenas, inquiries and investigations. The Company believes it is not a party to, nor are any of its properties the subject of, any pending legal, arbitration, regulatory or investigative proceedings that would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial condition or liquidity. However, it is possible that the outcome of any such proceeding could have a material impact on results of operations in any particular reporting period as the proceedings are resolved. Certain legal proceedings involving the Company are described below and others, for which there have been no subsequent material developments since the filing of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012, are described in such report.  For those legal proceedings and governmental examinations referred to in the last sentence of the preceding paragraph for which a loss is reasonably possible in future periods, whether in excess of a related accrued liability or where there is no accrued liability, and for which the Company is able to estimate a range of possible loss, the current estimated range is zero to $440 million in excess of the accrued liability (if any) related to those matters. This aggregate range represents management’s estimate of possible loss with respect to these matters and is based on currently available information. This estimated range of possible loss does not represent the Company’s maximum loss exposure. The legal proceedings and governmental examinations underlying the estimated range will change from time to time and actual results may vary significantly from the current estimate. For additional information, refer to Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.    79    Table of Contents Corporate Matters  During the last few years as regulatory interest in credit card network pricing to merchants and related issues has increased, the Company has responded to many inquiries from banking and competition authorities throughout the world.  On October 4, 2010, the DOJ, along with Attorneys General from Connecticut, Iowa, Maryland, Michigan, Missouri, Ohio and Texas, filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York against the Company, MasterCard International Incorporated and Visa, Inc., alleging a violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Antitrust Act. The complaint alleges that the defendants’ policies prohibiting merchants from steering a customer to use another network’s card, another type of card or another method of payment (“anti-steering” and “non-discrimination” rules and contractual provisions) violate the antitrust laws. The complaint alleges that the defendants participate in two distinct markets, a “General Purpose Card network services market” and a “General Purpose Card network services market for merchants in travel and entertainment (“T&E”) businesses.” The complaint contends that each of the defendants has market power in the alleged two markets. The complaint seeks a judgment permanently enjoining the defendants from enforcing their anti-steering and non-discrimination rules and contractual provisions. The complaint does not seek monetary damages. Concurrent with the filing of the complaint, Visa and MasterCard announced they had reached an agreement settling the allegations in the complaint against them by agreeing to modifications in their rules prohibiting merchants that accept their cards from steering customers to use another network’s card, another type of card or another method of payment. In December 2010, the complaint filed by the DOJ and certain state attorneys general was amended to add as plaintiffs the Attorneys General from Arizona, Hawaii (Hawaii has since withdrawn its claim), Idaho, Illinois, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Utah and Vermont. American Express’ response to the amended complaint was filed in early January 2011.  The DOJ matter is being coordinated with individual and putative class actions pending in the Eastern District of New York against American Express brought by merchants alleging that the Company’s “anti-steering” provisions in its merchant acceptance agreements with the plaintiffs violate federal antitrust laws. As alleged by the plaintiffs, these provisions prevent merchants from offering consumers incentives to use alternative forms of payment when consumers wish to use an American Express-branded card. Plaintiffs seek damages and injunctive relief. Following the Supreme Court’s June 20, 2013 decision in In re American Express Merchants’ Litigation (described below), the partial stay of the putative class actions was lifted and the Company moved to compel arbitration of certain merchants’ claims.  On November 7, 2012, a shareholder derivative action captioned Lankford v. Chenault, et al., and American Express Co., was filed in New York State Supreme Court, New York County. The defendants include the Company’s Board of Directors and the Company itself, as a nominal defendant. No demand preceded the filing of the complaint. The complaint alleges that the Company and/or its subsidiaries were engaged in illicit practices with respect to their credit and charge card business, which included charging unlawful late fees, misleading consumers on debt collection issues, failing to report consumer disputes to credit reporting agencies, deceiving consumers who signed up for the Company’s “Blue Sky” credit card program, and discriminating against new account applicants on the basis of age. Based on those allegations, the complaint further alleges: breach of fiduciary duties by disseminating false and misleading information, failure to maintain internal controls, and failure to properly oversee and manage the Company; unjust enrichment; abuse of control; and gross mismanagement. The amount of purported damages is unspecified in the complaint. Similar allegations were raised in demand letters received by the Company during October 2012 on behalf of purported shareholders. As permitted by law, a committee of the Board conducted an investigation and concluded that that it was not in the best interest of the Company or its stockholders to pursue the demanded actions; following the committee’s recommendations, the Board determined not to take the demanded actions. A hearing on American Express’ motion to dismiss the Lankford case was held    80    Table of Contents  on July 9, 2013. Thereafter, plaintiff advised the court that it would be withdrawing the complaint without prejudice.  U.S. Card Services and Global Merchant Services Matters  In addition to the merchant cases being coordinated with the DOJ and state actions described above in “Corporate Matters,” the Company has been named in the following matters:  Since July 2003, the Company has been named in a number of putative class actions in which the plaintiffs allege an unlawful antitrust tying arrangement between certain of the Company’s charge cards and credit cards in violation of various state and federal laws. These cases have all been consolidated in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York under the caption: In re American Express Merchants’ Litigation. A case making similar allegations was also filed in the Southern District of New York in July 2004 captioned: The Marcus Corporation v. American Express Company, et al. The Marcus case is not consolidated. The plaintiffs in these actions seek injunctive relief and an unspecified amount of damages. Since April 2004, the parties to the consolidated actions have been engaged in motion practice regarding American Express’ motion to dismiss the consolidated actions on the grounds that all of the plaintiffs’ claims are subject to arbitration. On February 1, 2012, the Second Circuit again reversed the District Court’s decision ordering arbitration, and reaffirmed its prior ruling. On May 29, 2012, the Second Circuit denied the Company’s petition for rehearing en banc with dissents. The Second Circuit stayed the mandate pending the outcome of the Company’s petition for a writ of certiorari to the U.S. Supreme Court. On June 20, 2013, the Supreme Court reversed the Second Circuit’s decision and held that the arbitration provision governed plaintiffs’ claims. The case will be remanded for further proceedings.  In October 2007, The Marcus Corporation filed a motion seeking certification of a class. In September 2008, American Express moved for summary judgment seeking dismissal of The Marcus Corporation’s complaint, and The Marcus Corporation cross-moved for partial summary judgment on the issue of liability. In March 2009, the Court denied the plaintiffs’ motion for class certification, without prejudicing their right to remake such a motion upon resolution of the pending summary judgment motions.  In February 2009, an amended complaint was filed in In re American Express Merchants’ Litigation. The amended complaint contains a single count alleging a violation of federal antitrust laws through an alleged unlawful tying of: (a) corporate, small business and/or personal charge card services; and (b) Blue, Costco and standard GNS credit card services. In addition, in February 2009, a new complaint making the same allegations as made in the amended complaint filed in In re American Express Merchants’ Litigation was also filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. That new case is captioned Greenporter LLC and Bar Hama LLC, on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated v. American Express Company and American Express Travel Related Services Company, Inc. Proceedings in the Greenporter action and on the amended complaint filed in In re American Express Merchants’ Litigation have been held in abeyance pending the disposition of the motions for summary judgment in the Marcus case.  In September 2001, Hoffman, et al. v. American Express Travel Related Services Company, et al. was filed in the Superior Court of the State of California, Alameda County. Plaintiffs in that case claim that American Express erroneously charged Cardmember accounts in connection with its airflight insurance programs because in certain circumstances customers must request refunds, as disclosed in materials for the voluntary program. In January 2006, the Court certified a class of American Express charge Cardmembers asserting claims for breach of contract and conversion under New York law, with a subclass of California residents asserting violations of California Business & Professions Code §§ 17200 and 17500, and a subclass of New York residents asserting violation of New York General Business Law § 349. American Express was granted judgment on all counts following trial and that judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeal for California on December 17, 2012. Plaintiffs’ petition to the California Supreme Court for review was denied.    81    Table of Contents In June 2013, a putative class action, captioned Seldes v. American Express Centurion Bank, was filed in the United States District Court, Southern District of Florida alleging that plaintiff received unilateral interest rate increases despite alleged promises that the rate would remain fixed. Plaintiff seeks to certify a nationwide class. On July 26, 2013, the Company moved to dismiss or, in the alternative, to stay this action.  International Matters  In November 2006, in a matter captioned Sylvan Adams v. Amex Bank of Canada filed in the Superior Court of Quebec, District of Montreal (originally filed in November 2004), the Superior Court authorized a class action against Amex Bank of Canada. The plaintiff alleges that prior to December 2003, Amex Bank of Canada charged a foreign currency conversion commission on transactions to purchase goods and services in currencies other than Canadian dollars and failed to disclose the commissions in monthly billing statements or solicitations directed to prospective cardmembers. The action further alleges that conversion commissions made on foreign currency transactions are credit charges under the Quebec Consumer Protection Act (the “QCPA”) and cannot be charged prior to the 21-day grace period under the QCPA. The class, consisting of all personal and small business cardmembers residing in Quebec that purchased goods or services in a foreign currency prior to December 2003, claims reimbursement of all foreign currency conversion commissions, CDN$1,000 in punitive damages per class member, interest and fees and costs. The trial in the Adams action commenced, and was completed, in December 2008 after the conclusion of the trial in the Marcotte action described below. The Superior Court rendered a judgment in favor of the plaintiffs against Amex Bank of Canada on June 11, 2009, and awarded damages in the amount of approximately CDN$13.1 million plus interest on the non-disclosure claims. In addition, the Superior Court awarded punitive damages in the amount of CDN$2.5 million. Amex Bank of Canada appealed the judgment and on August 2, 2012, the Court of Appeal overturned the decision in part, with regard to the award of punitive damages. On October 15, 2012, Amex Bank of Canada filed leave for appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada. The Supreme Court of Canada granted leave to appeal in April 2013.  In May 2006, in a matter captioned Marcotte v. Bank of Montreal, et al., filed in the Superior Court of Quebec, District of Montreal (originally filed in April 2003), the Superior Court authorized a class action against Amex Bank of Canada, Bank of Montreal, Toronto-Dominion Bank, Royal Bank of Canada, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Scotiabank, National Bank of Canada, Laurentian Bank of Canada and Citibank Canada. The action alleges that conversion commissions made on foreign currency transactions are credit charges under the QCPA and cannot be charged prior to the 21-day grace period under the QCPA. The class includes all persons residing in Quebec holding a credit card issued by one of the defendants to whom fees were charged since April 17, 2000, for transactions made in foreign currency before expiration of the period of 21 days following the statement of account. The class claims reimbursement of all foreign currency conversions, CDN$400 per class member for trouble, inconvenience and punitive damages, interest and fees and costs. The trial in the Marcotte action commenced in September 2008 and was completed in November 2008. The Superior Court rendered a judgment in favor of the plaintiffs against Amex Bank of Canada on June 11, 2009, and awarded damages in the amount of approximately CDN$8.3 million plus interest on the QCPA claims and individual claims to be made on the non-disclosure claims. In addition, the Superior Court awarded punitive damages in the amount of CDN$25.00 per cardmember. The judgment has been appealed by all banks, including Amex Bank of Canada. On August 2, 2012, the Court of Appeal overturned the decision against Amex Bank of Canada and certain of the other co-defendants. The remaining co-defendants and the plaintiffs filed leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada. The Supreme Court of Canada granted leave to appeal in April 2013.  ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS  This section supplements and updates certain of the information found under Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012 (the 2012 Form 10-K) and should be read in conjunction with the discussion of risk factors set forth in such section.    82    Table of Contents  Based on the information currently known to the Company, it believes the matter discussed below, together with the risk factors set forth in the 2012 Form 10-K, identify the most significant risk factors affecting the Company. However, the risks and uncertainties that the Company faces are not limited to those described below and those set forth in the 2012 Form 10-K. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the Company or that it currently believes to be immaterial may also adversely affect the Company’s business and the trading price of its securities.  Proposed payments legislation in the European Union could, if enacted, adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.  In January 2012, the European Commission (the Commission) published a Green Paper (a document to begin a process of consultation toward potential regulation) covering a range of issues affecting the payments industry. The Commission has completed a consultation period and issued its preliminary conclusions on July 24, 2013.  Among other things, the proposals address interchange fees, anti-steering and honor-all-cards rules, surcharging, separation of processing from card network management, access rights to payment systems, perceived barriers to cross-border acquiring, mobile payments and technical standardization. For a description of certain of the proposals and their potential impacts on the Company, see “Certain Legislative, Regulatory and Other Developments” under Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations above.  The Company cannot predict the final form, or effects on American Express, of this proposed legislation. These and other potential or proposed legislative and regulatory changes could negatively impact the Company’s discount revenue derived from its business in the EU as a result of downward pressure on the discount rate from anticipated decreases in competitor pricing in connection with the proposed caps on interchange fees. The Company may also be required to change certain of its business practices, including requirements around card acceptance by merchants, or alter its business relationships in the EU, including arrangements with GNS partners. If the scope of permissible surcharging or steering is expanded, there could be an adverse impact on the Company’s cards-in-force, transaction volumes, discount revenue or other parameters impacting financial performance. The proposed legislation also may require the Company to invest significant management attention and resources to make any necessary changes and could adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.    83    Table of Contents ITEM 2.
