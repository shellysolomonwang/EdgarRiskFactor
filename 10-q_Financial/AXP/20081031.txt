Item 1A. Risk Factors).   The Company regularly seeks to expand the capacity and diversity of its funding sources. The Company has historically relied on the debt capital markets to satisfy a substantial amount of its funding needs, as do many financial services companies. It has not historically gathered retail customer deposits; the majority of its deposits have historically been raised from institutional investors. In August 2008, the Company, through its American Express Credit Corporation (Credco) subsidiary, commenced an InterNotes® program, which offers retail investors the opportunity to make unsecured medium and long-term fixed income investments in the Company. Additionally, the Company launched in October a retail certificate of deposit (CD) program through the Company’s subsidiaries, American Express Centurion Bank (Centurion Bank) and American Express Bank, FSB (FSB and together with Centurion Bank, the Banks). These CDs are offered to depositors with amounts that fully qualify for Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) deposit insurance protection. The Company has raised approximately $1.1 billion of funding under these programs through October 28, 2008.   The mix of the Company’s funding sources will seek to achieve cost-efficiency consistent with its funding and liquidity strategies. Further disruptions and continued turmoil in the financial markets could result in changes in the amount, mix and cost of financing it obtains in the future from its existing funding sources. The Company’s ability to obtain financing in the debt capital market for unsecured term debt and asset securitizations is subject to a renewal of investor demand that existed prior to the current heightened period of turmoil. The Company is eligible and intends to access several of the U.S. government programs recently enacted to stabilize the credit markets (see further discussion under Liquidity below).   The Company has also moved to increase its flexibility in funding U.S. consumer and small business charge card receivables by amending the receivables purchase agreements between the Banks and Credco. The previous agreements call for the Banks, which issue the Company’s U.S. consumer and small business charge cards, to sell all unsecuritized receivables relating to spending on those cards to Credco. The amended agreements will give the Banks the flexibility to continue to sell the receivables to Credco or to retain the receivables and fund them from their own sources. These amendments will allow the Company to shift from time-to-time the funding of those receivables from Credco to the Banks. Credco, which raises funds for the    38        purpose of buying receivables principally through the sale of commercial paper, including through the Federal Reserve’s Commercial Paper Financing Facility (CPFF) as well as medium- and long-term debt securities, can transfer proceeds of its funding activities in excess of its needs broadly to other subsidiaries of the Company, including to the Banks. The Banks, in turn, have their own broad sources of funding and contingent liquidity. As described below, the Banks are eligible to issue FDIC guaranteed senior unsecured debt, as well as have the capability of borrowing from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco under the Federal Reserve’s Term Auction Facility (TAF) or, in a contingent situation, the discount window. The new arrangements between Credco and the Banks will have no impact on Credco’s funding of U.S. corporate card charge card receivables and charge card receivables outside the U.S.   Recently, three of the four credit rating agencies that rate the Company provided updates on the Company’s ratings as follows:   · Moody’s Investors Services (Moody’s) - On October 20, 2008, Moody’s lowered the Long-term Senior ratings of the Company from A1 to A2, American Express Travel Related Services and several rated subsidiaries from Aa3 to A1 and revised its outlook of the Company and its subsidiaries from stable to negative. This change, which brings the ratings for the Company’s funding subsidiaries to the same level as other rating agencies, reflects concerns regarding weakness in the broader economy and specific concerns regarding “negative asset quality trends and lending exposures.” Moody’s affirmed all of its short-term ratings. On October 23, 2008, Moody’s affirmed its ratings on all outstanding classes of rated asset-backed securities issued by the Company’s lending and charge trusts.   · Standard & Poor’s (S&P) - On October 21, 2008, S&P placed its long-term ratings on the Company and its subsidiaries (currently A+) on Creditwatch with negative implications. The rating agency review will focus on the ability of the Company to cope with the current operating environment as well as outlook for credit losses and profitability relative to the current rating level. S&P’s affirmed its short-term ratings.   · Dominion Bond Rating Service (DBRS) - On October 21, 2008, DBRS announced that it has maintained its stable Long-term Senior ratings of the Company and its related subsidiaries (A (high)).   Maintenance of high and stable debt ratings is critical to ensuring the Company has continuous access to capital and credit markets at cost-effective rates. Historically, credit ratings have had a significant impact on the borrowing capacity and costs of the Company. The Company is in the process of assessing the impact of these rating changes in light of the current economic conditions.   Liquidity   As discussed in the Company’s current report on Form 8-K dated October 6, 2008, the upcoming approximate maturities of the Company’s long-term debt and debt issued in connection with off-balance sheet securitizations are as follows:              Debt Maturities         (Billions) Quarter Ending:       Long-term       Off-Balance Sheet       Total         December 31, 2008       $   3.6       $   —       $   3.6         March 31, 2009       $   2.3       $   1.5       $   3.8         June 30, 2009       $   7.2       $   0.6       $   7.8         September 30, 2009       $   2.9       $   2.7       $   5.6         December 31, 2009       $   2.9       $   —       $   2.9          39        As of September 30, 2008, the Company’s approximate U.S. capital market short-term outstandings were as follows:      (Billions)       Commercial Paper       Bank Time Deposits and Fed Funds       Total                                           Gross amount       $   9       $   9       $   18   (a)     Proceeds from issuance invested in cash and cash equivalents       (5   )   (7   )   (12   )(b)     Net amount       $   4       $   2       $   6              (a)   Excludes FDIC-insured demand deposits of approximately $4 billion and non-U.S. short-term term debt and deposits of approximately $3 billion.               (b)   Excludes cash and cash equivalents on hand for day-to-day operations.      In addition to the short- and long-term capital market programs that the Company has accessed to satisfy its funding needs, as of September 30, 2008, the Company had access to the following alternative funding sources:      ·       $12 billion of cash and cash equivalents for liquidity purposes, which excludes cash and cash equivalents on hand to fund day-to-day operations;     ·       a $5 billion liquidity investment portfolio;     ·       a $5 billion undrawn committed facility to purchase securitized credit card receivables; and     ·       $9 billion of undrawn committed bank credit facilities.      See discussion of the Primary Reserve Fund in the Investment Portfolio section.   FSB and Centurion Bank are insured depository institutions that have the capability of borrowing from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, subject to the amount of qualifying collateral that they pledge. On October 3, 2008, the Banks were approved to access the discount window and the TAF, subject to the discretion of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco and sufficient credit card receivables pledged as collateral, thereby providing the Banks with an additional source of contingent liquidity, if needed.   The Company has approximately $45 billion in U.S. credit card loans and charge card receivables that could be sold over time through its existing securitization trusts, its undrawn committed securitization facility referred to above, or pledged in return for secured borrowings, to provide further liquidity, subject in each case to applicable market conditions and eligibility criteria.   On October 7, 2008, the Federal Reserve Board (the Board) announced the creation of the CPFF. The CPFF provides three month liquidity to U.S. issuers of commercial paper through a special purpose vehicle (SPV), which purchases three month unsecured and asset-backed commercial paper directly from eligible issuers using financing provided by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The commercial paper must be rated at least A1/P1/F1 by a major nationally recognized statistical rating organization (NRSRO) and, if rated by multiple major NRSROs, must be rated at least A1/P1/F1 by two or more NRSROs.   Eligible commercial paper issuers must register with the CPFF in order to sell commercial paper to the SPV. Credco’s registration was accepted by the Board on October 23, 2008. The maximum amount of a single issuer’s commercial paper the SPV may own at any time is limited to the greatest amount of U.S. dollar denominated commercial paper outstanding on any day between January 1 and August 31, 2008. Credco’s greatest amount of commercial paper outstanding during the reference period was approximately $14.7 billion. Credco paid a facility fee of approximately $15 million in connection with its registration in the program. Accessing the CPFF will allow Credco to prudently manage its debt maturity and liquidity profiles and provide further diversity to its sources of funding. On October 29, 2008, Credco, in addition to issuing commercial paper to its existing investor base,   40        sold commercial paper to the SPV. The commercial paper sold to the SPV matures on January 27, 2009, and was sold on a discounted basis at an interest rate equal to 1.84 percent per annum. In addition, pursuant to the terms of the CPFF, Credco paid an unsecured credit surcharge equal to 1 percent per annum on the face value of the amount borrowed. The SPV is currently scheduled to cease purchasing commercial paper on April 30, 2009, unless the Board extends the facility. Credco expects to access the funding available through the CPFF from time-to-time during the life of the facility, subject to market conditions and Credco’s continuing to meet the eligibility criteria for participation in the facility.    On October 14, 2008, the FDIC announced the establishment of a new program – the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program (TLGP) – to temporarily guarantee newly-issued senior unsecured debt of eligible entities, including insured banks, and to provide guarantee coverage to non-interest-bearing transaction accounts in FDIC-insured institutions, regardless of amount. Under the plan, certain newly-issued senior unsecured debt issued on or before June 30, 2009, would be eligible for insurance benefits in the event the issuing entity subsequently fails or becomes bankrupt. Coverage would be limited to June 30, 2012, even if the maturity of covered debt exceeds that date. The amount of debt covered by the TLGP generally may not exceed 125 percent of debt that was outstanding as of September 30, 2008, and that was scheduled to mature before June 30, 2009, and the FDIC may restrict a participating entity to less than the 125 percent limit and/or impose other limits or requirements. The Company believes that its subsidiary Banks, as FDIC depository institutions, are both eligible to participate in this program. The Banks’ senior unsecured debt as of September 30, 2008, that is scheduled to mature within the reference period is approximately $7.1 billion.   In consideration of all the funding sources described above, the Company believes that it would have access to liquidity to satisfy all maturing obligations and fund normal business operations for at least a 12-month period in the event that access to the secured and unsecured fixed income capital markets was completely interrupted for that length of time. This excludes any impact if the securitization trusts were to meet certain events that would require an early amortization. These events are not considered likely to occur.   See Financing Activities section for discussion of the potential impact on the Company’s liquidity of decreasing rates of excess spread.   Investment Portfolios   The Company’s investment portfolios support specific business purposes. The most significant business purposes and the related investments used to support those business purposes are as follows:      Business Purpose       Investments     Travelers Cheques       State and municipal obligations Corporate debt obligations                   Insurance       State and municipal obligations                   Contingent liquidity       U.S. government obligations U.S. government-sponsored-entities senior unsecured obligations (In addition, the Company considers cash items such as money market funds and short-term time deposits as part of its contingent liquidity resources)                   AEIDC – discontinued operations       Mortgage and other asset-backed securities      The Company’s objective is to manage the type and mix of assets as well as their maturity profile in order to ensure the cash and liquidity needs of the respective business purpose can be met without relying on the sale of investments prior to maturity. As a result, the Company generally holds its investments until their maturity. However, management may sell securities prior to their maturity due to changes in Company-specific business goals, liquidity needs, and the credit and capital market environment, and therefore it is important for the Company to invest in securities with sufficient liquidity to ensure changes to cash needs may be met.   41        All of the Company’s investments included in continuing operations are classified as available-for-sale. The Company reviews its investments at least quarterly and more often as market conditions may require to evaluate their fair values and to identify investments that have indications of other-than-temporary impairments. The determination of other-than-temporary impairments for available-for-sale securities is a subjective process, requiring the use of various assumptions and application of judgment.   State and Municipal Obligations   Total gross unrealized losses related to state and municipal securities amounted to approximately $790 million and $136 million at September 30, 2008 and December 31, 2007, respectively.   Unrealized losses on securities may be caused by changes in market interest rates, which include both benchmark interest rates such as Treasury rates and liquidity and credit spreads that apply across the entire market, and specific credit events associated with individual issuers. In addition, unrealized losses may also be caused by excess supply of securities in the market caused by unusual activity in the credit markets. The gross unrealized losses on the state and municipal securities are attributable in part to pricing pressures resulting from the excess supply of these types of securities in the market that were caused by unusually high redemptions of municipal money market funds that occurred in September 2008. The Company believes it has the ability and intent to hold these securities for a time sufficient to allow market conditions to stabilize and recover the unrealized losses. The Company expects that the contractual principal and interest will be received on these securities. Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities are included in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income until disposition of the investments.   Approximately 63 percent of state and municipal investments owned by the Company are insured by financial guarantors that guarantee timely payment of interest and ultimate payment of principal on insured obligations. At September 30, 2008, the state and municipal investments owned by the Company were rated as follows:              Higher of Financial       Underlying Issuers’                 Guarantors’ and Underlying       Ratings without                 Issuers’ Ratings       Regard to Guarantors         AAA       36   %   22   %     AA       35   %   31   %     A       25   %   37   %     BBB       4   %   9   %     BB       —   %   1   %      To date, the Company has not realized any losses as a result of financial guarantors’ credit problems.   Government Sponsored Entities   At September 30, 2008, the Company owned approximately $3.1 billion of senior unsecured debentures issued by Government Sponsored Entities (GSEs): Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. On September 7, 2008, the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) announced the decision to place Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac into conservatorship run by FHFA.  These actions were designed to protect the senior and subordinated debt and the mortgage-backed securities of the GSEs and had a slight positive impact on the fair value of these securities. The total net unrealized gains on these securities were approximately $17 million at September 30, 2008.   Mortgage and Other Asset-Backed Securities   The Company’s exposure to mortgage and other asset-backed securities, excluding the investments in retained subordinated securities from the Company’s securitization programs ($1.3 billion at September 30, 2008), decreased substantially to $390 million at September 30, 2008, from $2.5 billion at December 31, 2007. Of the $390 million in mortgage and other asset-backed securities, $321 million are used to support the AEIDC certificate business and are included in assets of discontinued operations. The decrease in    42        mortgage and asset-backed securities was primarily due to the sale and maturities of approximately $1.1 billion of investment securities used to support the AEIDC certificate business, and $838 million of investments included in the sale of AEB.   At September 30, 2008, the Company’s remaining asset-backed securities were rated as follows:   · AAA – 87% · AA – 7% · A – 2% · BBB – 4 %   During the third quarter of 2008, five separate asset-backed securities held by the Company at September 30, 2008, with a value of approximately $29 million were downgraded but remain investment grade.   Of the $390 million in mortgage and other asset-backed securities, $69 million of asset-backed securities are classified as available-for-sale within continuing operations and are rated AAA. Total gross unrealized losses at September 30, 2008, related to the asset-backed securities classified as available-for-sale amounted to approximately $1 million.   Money Market Mutual Fund   At September 30, 2008, the Company owned a $500 million investment in the Primary Reserve Fund (the Fund), a money market fund. The net asset value of the Fund fell below $1 per share in September 2008. The Company recorded a loss of $15 million related to its investment in the Fund. The Company filed a redemption order with Reserve, the Fund sponsor in September 2008. Redemptions from the Fund have been suspended and the timing of receipt of the proceeds cannot be determined at this time. The amount due from the Fund is recorded in other receivables in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.   With the exception of its exposure to the Fund, the Company did not experience any defaults or events of default, or determine it would not receive timely contractual payments of interest and repayment of principal on any of its holdings in its investment portfolios, in the third quarter of 2008.   Certain Legislative and Regulatory Developments   In recent years, there has been a heightened level of regulatory attention on banks and the payments industry in many countries. Among other recent regulatory developments, in May 2008, federal bank regulators in the U.S. proposed amendments to the rules regarding Unfair or Deceptive Acts or Practices (UDAP) and Truth in Lending that would restrict certain credit and charge card practices and require expanded disclosures to consumers. Similar legislative initiatives have been proposed. The proposed regulatory amendments include, among other matters, rules relating to the imposition by card issuers of interest rate increases on outstanding balances and the allocation of payments in respect of outstanding balances with different interest rates. The Company is continuing to evaluate the proposals, but if the regulatory amendments are adopted as proposed and the Company was not to take offsetting actions to mitigate their impact, they would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations.   The credit and charge card industry also faces continuing scrutiny in connection with the fees merchants are charged to accept cards. Although investigations into the way bankcard network members collectively set the “interchange” (i.e., the fee paid by the bankcard merchant acquirer to the card issuing bank in “four party” payment networks, like Visa and MasterCard) had largely been a subject of regulators outside the United States, a bill was introduced in Congress in early 2008 designed to give merchants antitrust immunity to negotiate interchange collectively with Visa and MasterCard. Although unlike the Visa and MasterCard networks, the American Express network does not collectively set interchange fees, antitrust actions and government regulation of the bankcard networks’ pricing could ultimately affect all networks.   In addition, the Financial Accounting Standards Board is considering whether to propose amendments that would significantly affect the accounting for off-balance sheet securitization activities, which could, if ultimately adopted, result in the Company’s having to consolidate the assets and liabilities of the American Express Credit Account Master Trust (the Lending Trust). While the Company’s consolidated capital    43        allocation process already considers the capital needs associated with off-balance sheet assets, any consolidation of the Lending Trust could require Centurion Bank and FSB to increase capital on their respective balance sheets to satisfy regulatory capital requirements.   Fair Value Measurements   Effective January 1, 2008, the Company partially adopted SFAS No. 157 for its financial assets and liabilities that are accounted for at fair value. SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The Company’s partial adoption of SFAS No. 157 did not result in significant changes to the valuation techniques it had previously used to measure the fair value of its financial assets and liabilities. Therefore, the primary impact to the Company upon its partial adoption of SFAS No. 157 was expanding its fair value measurement disclosures. Effective September 30, 2008, the Company adopted FSP No. FAS 157-3 “Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset When the Market for that Asset is Not Active” (FSP FAS 157-3), which applies to financial assets that are required or permitted to be measured at fair value in accordance with SFAS No. 157, and clarifies the application of SFAS No. 157 for assets in markets that are not active. The adoption of FSP FAS 157-3 did not have a significant impact on the Company’s financial position or results of operations, nor did it have a significant impact on the valuation techniques used by the Company in measuring the fair value of its financial assets.   SFAS No. 157 established a three-level hierarchy of valuation techniques used to measure fair value, defined as follows:   · Unadjusted Quoted Prices - The fair value of an asset or liability is based on unadjusted quoted prices, in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. An example would be a marketable equity security that is actively traded on the New York Stock Exchange. (Level 1)   · Pricing Models with Significant Observable Inputs - The fair value of an asset or liability is based on information derived from either an active market quoted price, which may require further adjustment based on the attributes of the financial asset or liability being measured, or an inactive market transaction. Examples of such instruments would include (i) a quoted price for an actively traded equity investment that is adjusted for a contractual trading restriction, or (ii) the fair value derived from a trade of an identical or similar security in an inactive market. (Level 2)   · Pricing Models with Significant Unobservable Inputs - The fair value of an asset or liability is primarily based on internally derived assumptions surrounding the timing and amount of expected cash flows for the financial instrument. Therefore, these assumptions are unobservable in either an active or inactive market. An example would be the retained interest in a securitization trust. (Level 3)   44        The fair market values for the Company’s investments are determined from the following sources:      Description of Securities       Pricing Services (b)       Internal Model (c)         State and municipal obligations       $   6,021       $   —         U.S. Government and agencies obligations       5,092       —         Mortgage and other asset-backed securities (a)       69       —         Equity securities       326       —         Corporate debt securities       275       —         Foreign government bonds and obligations       101       —         Other       106       1,287         Total       $   11,990       $   1,287              (a)       Does not include $321 million of mortgage and other asset-backed securities used to support the AEIDC certificate business which are included in Assets of Discontinued Operations. Of the $321 million, $308 million are valued by pricing services and are classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, and $13 million are valued by single, non-binding broker quotes and are classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. See Note 2 and 7 of the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements for further details regarding its fair value measurements.                   (b)       Pricing services include individual pricing vendors as well as media services such as Bloomberg. The Company receives one price for each security, and does not adjust the price obtained. In addition, the pricing vendors do not apply any adjustments to the pricing models used. With the exception of the $13 million in other asset-backed securities discussed above, the securities priced using pricing services are classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.                   (c)       Represents A-rated and BBB-rated retained subordinated securities from the Company’s securitization program, classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. See Note 7 of the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements for further details regarding its fair value measurements.      The inputs to the valuation techniques vary depending on the type of security being priced but include benchmark yields, credit spread commensurate with the risk of the respective securities, and prepayment rate of the security or similar securities. Valuations of securities held within the Company’s investment portfolio are subject to changes in these inputs due to external market factors including default rates, rating agency actions, the prices at which observable market transactions occur, and the volume of observable market transactions. However, the Company does not anticipate any significant impact on its operations, liquidity or capital resources as a result of a change in fair value of these instruments.   At September 30, 2008, the Company reaffirmed its understanding of the valuation techniques used by its pricing vendors. Pricing services only provide a security price if there is sufficient market activity to obtain observable market inputs. The Company uses non-binding broker quotes or internal models to determine the price of a security if the pricing service is unable or unwilling to provide a security price due to the lack of observable inputs. Pricing services were unable to provide prices on two mortgage-backed securities due to insufficient market activity. These two securities, totaling $13 million, are included in assets of discontinued operations. In addition, the Company corroborates the prices provided by its pricing vendors to test their reasonableness by comparing their prices to valuations from different pricing sources as well as comparing prices to the sale prices received from sold securities.   At September 30, 2008, the fair value of the Company’s financial instruments categorized as Level 3 were its A-rated and BBB-rated retained subordinated interests (included in the table above) and its interest-only strip of $1.3 billion and $38 million, respectively. These financial instruments represent approximately 1 percent of the Company’s total assets and less than 10 percent of the Company’s assets measured at fair value. The Company believes the fair values of these financial instruments would approximate the amount received if the Company had sold these instruments in the open market on the measurement date. See Note 7 of the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements for further details regarding its fair value measurements.   45        Consolidated Liquidity and Capital Resources   Capital Strategy   The Company believes allocating capital to growing businesses with a return on risk-adjusted equity in excess of its cost of capital will generate shareholder value. The Company retains sufficient earnings and other capital generated to satisfy growth objectives and maintain a solid equity capital base. To the extent capital exceeds business, regulatory, and rating agency requirements, the Company returns excess capital to shareholders through dividends and the share repurchase programs.   Assuming the Company achieves its financial objectives of 12 to 15 percent EPS growth, 33 to 36 percent ROE and at least 8 percent revenue growth, on average and over time, it will seek to return to shareholders an average of 65 percent of capital generated, subject to business mix, acquisitions and rating agency requirements.   During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2008, the Company paid $209 million and $627 million in dividends and share repurchases as discussed below. Including dividends and share repurchases, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2008, the Company returned approximately 24 percent and 31 percent, respectively, of total capital generated to shareholders. On a cumulative basis, since the inception of the share repurchase program in 1994, approximately 68 percent of capital generated has been returned to shareholders.   Share Repurchases   The Company has a share repurchase program to return equity capital in excess of its business needs to shareholders. These share repurchases both offset the issuance of new shares as part of employee compensation plans and reduce shares outstanding. The Company repurchases its common shares primarily by open market purchases. The Company reduced its level of share repurchases in the first quarter of 2008 from previous levels in order to use the funds generated from operations to acquire the CPS business from GE. No shares have been repurchased since the first quarter of 2008 in light of the uncertain U.S. economic environment. During the nine months ended September 30, 2008, the Company purchased 4.7 million common shares at an average price of $46.10. Going forward, the Company will forgo further share repurchases until business conditions improve. The Company remains committed to maintaining a strong capital position.   At September 30, 2008, there are approximately 100 million shares remaining under authorizations to repurchase shares approved by the Company’s Board of Directors. Generally the Company retires shares upon repurchase; however, at September 30, 2008, it held approximately 372,000 shares in treasury that are not considered outstanding for earnings per common share computation purposes. For additional information regarding the Company’s share repurchases during the three months ended September 30, 2008, see Item 2(c) in Part II.   Cash Flows   Cash Flows from Operating Activities   The Company generated net cash provided by operating activities in amounts greater than net income for both the nine months ended September 30, 2008 and 2007, primarily due to provisions for losses, which represent expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income but do not require cash at the time of provision. Similarly, depreciation and amortization represent non-cash expenses. In addition, net cash was provided by fluctuations in other receivables and liabilities (including the Membership Rewards liability) for the nine months ended September 30, 2008. These accounts vary significantly in the normal course of business due to the amount and timing of various payments.   Management believes cash flows from operations, available cash balances and borrowings will be sufficient to fund the Company’s operating liquidity needs. See Liquidity section for further discussion on the Company’s liquidity needs.   46        Cash Flows from Investing Activities   The Company’s investing activities primarily include funding cardmember loans and receivables, securitizations of cardmember loans and receivables, and the Company’s available-for-sale investment portfolio.   For the nine months ended September 30, 2008, net cash provided by investing activities was primarily due to proceeds from cardmember loan securitizations, maturity, redemption and sale of investments, and cash provided by investing activities of discontinued operations, partially offset by the purchase of investments, maturities of cardmember loan securitizations, and acquisitions and dispositions. For the nine months ended September 30, 2007, net cash used in investing activities was primarily due to the net increase in cardmember loans and receivables, the purchase of investments, maturities of cardmember loan securitizations, and cash used in investing activities of discontinued operations, partially offset by the proceeds from cardmember loan securitizations and maturities, redemption and sales of investments.   Cash Flows from Financing Activities   The Company’s financing activities primarily include issuing debt and taking customer deposits.   For the nine months ended September 30, 2008, net cash used in financing activities was primarily due to net cash used in financing activities of discontinued operations, decrease in customers’ deposits and a net decrease in debt. For the nine months ended September 30, 2007, net cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to a net increase in debt partially offset by a decrease in customer deposits and repurchases of the Company’s common shares.   Financing Activities   The Company’s assets and growth have been financed primarily through the issuances of senior unsecured debentures, asset securitizations, long-term committed bank borrowing facilities, commercial paper, bank notes, customer deposits, medium-term notes, and bank borrowings. Short-term debt at September 30, 2008, decreased $3.9 billion from December 31, 2007, primarily due to reduced market availability for borrowed funds and commercial paper during the third quarter of 2008. Long-term debt at September 30, 2008, increased $2.5 billion from December 31, 2007, as a result of $13.3 billion issuances offset by $10.3 billion of maturities as well as the revaluation of certain foreign currency denominated debt.   At September 30, 2008, the American Express Company (Parent Company) had an unspecified amount of debt and equity securities, and Credco, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, had an unspecified amount of debt available for issuance under shelf registrations filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In addition, certain subsidiaries of the Company have established a program for the issuance of debt instruments outside the United States to be listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange. On July 18, 2008, this program was renewed and the maximum aggregate principal amount of debt instruments outstanding at any one time under the program was increased to $50.0 billion. At September 30, 2008, $4.0 billion was outstanding under this program.   On June 30, 2008, the American Express Credit Account Master Trust (the Lending Trust) issued to certain wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company (the Subsidiaries) the Lending Trust’s (i) Class A Series 2008-A Variable Funding Floating Rate Asset-Backed Certificates in a maximum principal amount of $5 billion (the Class A Certificates) and (ii) Class B Series 2008-A Variable Funding Floating Rate Asset-Backed Certificates in a maximum principal amount of $313 million (together with the Class A Certificates, the “Certificates”). The Certificates were issued in an initial principal amount of $0. In connection with the issuance, the Subsidiaries sold the Class A Certificates to certain parties who have agreed to fund, from time to time at the request of the Subsidiaries through June 29, 2009 (as may be extended), the unfunded amounts under the Class A Certificates up to the maximum principal amount. The purchasers’ commitments to fund any unfunded amounts under the Class A Certificates are subject to the terms and conditions of, among other things, the Class A Certificates and a purchase agreement among the Subsidiaries, the purchasers and certain other parties.   47        The table below summarizes certain key metrics reported by the Lending Trust and the American Express Issuance Trust (the Charge Trust) in their September 2008 monthly servicer reports:              Lending Trust       Charge Trust                 Month of September 2008       Three-Month Average September 2008       Month of September 2008       Three-Month Average September 2008         Total Trust Excess Spread Rate, net (d)       7.94   %(a)   8.48   %(a)   24.84   %(b)   25.38   %(b)       (a) Total Trust Excess Spread Rate, net in the Lending Trust is the sum of the net cash flows of the (i) excess spread, net and (ii) issuer rate, as a percentage of the outstanding investors’ certificates. Excess spread, net is the net cash flows from interest and fee collections allocated to the investors’ interests after deducting the interest paid on investors’ certificates, credit losses, contractual servicing fees and other expenses. The deductions may be a greater amount than the collections, resulting in negative spread losses. Excess spread, net is reported by the Company in securitization income, net in the Consolidated Statements of Income. See Note 6 in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements for the disclosure of excess spread, net.   Issuer rate collections are a portion of monthly discount revenue that is earned and collected by the Company on new transactions by cardmembers that have their loans sold into the Lending Trust. These cash flows are available to pay monthly Lending Trust expense. The issuer rate is reported in discount revenue in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income.   (b) Total Trust Excess Spread Rate, net in the Charge Trust is the net cash flows from the discounted portion of principal collections allocated to the investors’ interests after deducting the interest paid on investors’ notes, credit losses, contractual servicing fees and other expenses, as a percentage of the outstanding investors’ notes.   As described in (a) above, the excess spread, net in the Lending Trust could become negative. This would be reflected as an expense in securitization income, net in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income and as a reduction of the Total Trust Excess Spread Rate, net. In the event the Total Trust Excess Spread Rate, net is reduced below certain levels for either the Lending Trust or the Charge Trust, certain triggering events would occur, including:   · If the three-month average Total Trust Excess Spread Rate, net falls below five percent or four percent for the Lending Trust and Charge Trust, respectively, the affected Trust is required to fund a cash reserve account (from cash that would normally revert back to the Company through its subsidiaries) in increasing amounts from $60 million up to a maximum of approximately $2.0 billion for the Lending Trust and from $52 million up to a maximum $207 million for the Charge Trust, depending on the Total Trust Excess Spread Rate, net; and   · If the three-month average Total Trust Excess Spread Rate, net for either Trust falls below zero percent, an early amortization of the affected Trust will occur, as described in more detail below. The applicable cash reserve account (see above) for each Trust is available to the investors if the collections from the securitized loans and receivables are insufficient to pay the principal balance of the investors’ notes and certificates.   48        An early amortization event may also occur if the Company’s undivided, pro rata interest in the Trusts, the “seller’s interest”, represents less than 7 percent of the outstanding securities in the Lending Trust or 15 percent of the total receivables in the Charge Trust. As of September 30, 2008, the amount of seller’s interest was approximately 44 percent of the outstanding securities in the Lending Trust and 25 percent of the total receivables in the Charge Trust.   In the event of an early amortization of the Lending Trust the lending receivable assets and investor certificates issued by the Lending Trust ($29 billion at September 30, 2008) would revert to the Company’s balance sheet and the investor certificates would have to be repaid over an approximate four month period, based on the estimated average life of the securitized loans. Although the repayment of the investor certificates is non-recourse to the Company, the Company would need an alternate source of funding for the lending receivable assets that, as a consequence of the early amortization, would revert to the Company’s balance sheet, as well as for lending receivables that would be generated in the future from the accounts that are the source of the reverted receivables. Obtaining an alternate source of funding of a commensurate amount would present a severe liquidity challenge for the Company. In addition, had a total paydown of the Lending Trust hypothetically occurred at a single point in time at September 30, 2008, the cumulative negative effect on results of operations would have been approximately $1.67 billion pretax to re-establish credit loss reserves for the lending receivable assets put back on the Company’s balance sheet and to derecognize the retained interest assets related to these securitizations.   In the event of an early amortization of the Charge Trust the underlying investor notes issued by the Charge Trust ($5.2 billion at September 30, 2008) would have to be repaid over an approximate one month period. This would be a significant liquidity challenge for the Company, whereby an alternate source of funding of a commensurate amount would have to be obtained by the Company. There would be no other financial reporting impacts to the Company as the assets and liabilities of the Charge Trust are included in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.   In the first two weeks of October, the one month LIBOR rate increased significantly, and the prime rate was reduced, which negatively affects the Company’s expected Total Trust Excess Spread Rate, net for October. Expected increases in future write-offs will continue to decrease the Company’s Total Trust Excess Spread Rate, net. The Company plans to take actions to mitigate this decreasing rate, including pricing increases to certain of the Company’s lending products. To the extent the Total Trust Excess Spread rate is reduced to levels that require the Company to fund significant amounts in a special cash reserve account or repay investor certificates due to an early amortization event, the Company’s ability to access the capital markets going forward may be impacted materially.   At September 30, 2008, the Company maintained committed bank lines of credit totaling $11.9 billion, of which $3.0 billion was drawn as part of the Company’s funding activities. Credco has the right to borrow a maximum amount of $11.1 billion (including amounts outstanding) under these facilities, with a commensurate maximum $1.2 billion reduction in the amount available to the Parent Company.   The Parent Company is authorized to issue commercial paper. This program is supported by $1.2 billion of committed bank facilities available to the Company, which expire in 2010 and 2012 in the amounts of $500 million and $750 million, respectively. There was no Parent Company commercial paper outstanding during the three months ended September 30, 2008, and no borrowings have been made under its bank credit facilities.   Airline Industry Matters   Many industry analysts and some carriers have indicated that there could be consolidation in the airline industry in 2008, both in the United States and in some other countries. The Company would not expect consolidation to have a significant effect on its merchant relationships with the airlines. However, airlines are also some of the most important and valuable partners in the Company’s Membership Rewards program. If a participating airline merged with an airline that did not participate in Membership Rewards, the combined airline would have to determine, within the framework defined in its Membership Rewards contract, whether or not to continue participation. Similarly, if one of the Company’s co-brand airline partners merged with an airline that had a competing co-brand card, the combined airline would have to determine which co-brand cards it would offer, subject to terms of the corresponding co-brand contracts. If    49        a surviving airline determined to withdraw from Membership Rewards or to cease offering an American Express co-brand card, the Company’s business could be adversely affected. The Company has multiple co-brand relationships and rewards partners. The Company’s largest airline co-brand partner is Delta Air Lines (Delta), which merged with Northwest Airlines (which has a co-brand relationship with U.S. Bancorp) on October 29, 2008. American Express’ Delta SkyMiles Credit Card co-brand portfolio accounts for approximately 5 percent of the Company’s worldwide billed business and less than 15 percent of worldwide cardmember lending receivables.   This year has seen a significant number of airline bankruptcies and liquidations, driven in part by volatile fuel costs, which is creating additional risk to the Company. The current environment poses heightened challenges to our ability to manage this risk. For example, more airlines are converting their bankruptcy restructurings into liquidations or, in some instances, moving directly to liquidation thereby giving the Company less time to cover the Company’s exposure. Historically, the Company has not experienced significant revenue declines when a particular airline scales back or ceases operations due to a bankruptcy or other financial challenges. This is because volumes generated by that airline are typically shifted to other participants in the industry that accept the Company’s card products. Nonetheless, the Company is exposed to business and credit risk in the airline industry primarily through business arrangements where the Company has remitted payment to the airline for a cardmember purchase of tickets that have not yet been used or “flown.” In the event that the cardmember is not able to use the ticket and the Company, based on the facts and circumstances, credits the cardmember for the unused ticket, this business arrangement creates a potential exposure for the Company. This credit exposure is included in the maximum amount of undiscounted future payments disclosed in Note 12 to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. Historically, even for an airline that is operating under bankruptcy protection, this type of exposure has not generated any significant losses for the Company because an airline operating under bankruptcy protection needs to continue accepting credit and charge cards and honoring requests for credits and refunds in the ordinary course of its business. Typically, as an airline’s financial situation deteriorates, the Company delays payment to the airline thereby increasing cash withheld to protect the Company in the event the airline is liquidated. The Company’s goal in these distressed situations is to hold sufficient cash over time to ensure that upon liquidation, the cash held is equivalent to the credit exposure related to any unused tickets. The Company has not to date experienced significant losses from airlines that have ceased operations and entered into liquidation proceedings.   50        BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS   As discussed more fully below, results are presented on a GAAP basis unless otherwise stated.

(b)       Return on average segment capital is calculated by dividing (i) segment income ($795 million and $2.3 billion for the one year periods ended September 30, 2008 and 2007, respectively) by (ii) average segment capital ($4.7 billion and $4.5 billion for the one year periods ended September 30, 2008 and 2007, respectively). Return on average tangible segment capital is computed in the same manner as return on average segment capital except the computation of average tangible segment capital excludes average goodwill and other intangibles of $188 million and $169 million at September 30, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The Company believes that return on average tangible segment capital is a useful measure of the profitability of its business growth.                   (c)       “Owned,” a GAAP basis measurement, reflects only cardmember loans included in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.                   (d)       This metric was revised for the USCS segment to align with industry practice and the ICS segment whereby payments made by U.S. cardmembers after billing cycle cut but before month-end are applied to their oldest balances. Previously, USCS applied such payments to current balances.                   (e)       In the third quarter of 2008, the Company revised its method of reporting the cardmember lending net write-off rate. Historically, the net write-off rate has been presented using net write-off amounts for principal, interest, and fees. However, industry convention is generally to include only the net write-offs related to principal in write-off rate disclosures. The Company is presenting the net write-off rate using the net write-off amounts for principal only, consistent with industry convention.                   (f)       Net finance revenue, which represents cardmember lending finance revenue (including interest and fees) less cardmember lending interest expense, is computed on an annualized basis. Reserves and net write-offs related to interest and fees are recorded through Provision for losses - Cardmember lending.                   (g)       Includes on-balance sheet cardmember loans and off-balance sheet securitized cardmember loans. The difference between the “owned basis” (GAAP) information and “managed basis” information is attributable to the effects of securitization activities. Refer to the USCS managed basis section for further discussion.      52        Results of Operations for the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2008 and 2007   The following discussion of U.S. Card Services’ segment results of operations is presented on a GAAP basis.   U.S. Card Services reported segment income of $244 million for the three months ended September 30, 2008, a $348 million or 59 percent decrease from $592 million for the same period a year ago. For the nine months ended September 30, 2008, U.S. Card Services reported segment income of $788 million, a $1.0 billion or 57 percent decrease from $1.8 billion for the same period a year ago.   Revenues net of interest expense decreased $130 million or 4 percent for the three months ended September 30, 2008, primarily due to lower securitization income, net and cardmember lending finance revenue, partially offset by a decrease in interest expense. Revenues net of interest expense increased $261 million or 2 percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2008, due to a decrease in interest expense, an increase in discount revenue and net card fees and other, partially offset by lower securitization income, net and cardmember lending finance revenue.   Discount revenue, net card fees and other of $2.6 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2008, decreased $9 million or less than 1 percent from the same period a year ago, largely due to lower commissions and assessments, partially offset by greater billed business volumes and higher net card fees. Discount revenue, net card fees and other of $8.0 billion increased $283 million or 4 percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2008, primarily due to greater billed business volumes, higher net card fees and other revenue, partially offset by lower other commissions and assessments and by lower interest income due to the Company’s loan to Delta Air Lines as previously mentioned. The 4 percent and 6 percent increase in billed business for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2008, respectively, reflected 5 percent growth in basic cards-in-force for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2008. Within the U.S. consumer business, billed business grew 1 percent and 4 percent during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2008, respectively, and small business volumes rose 10 percent and 11 percent during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2008. Cardmember lending finance revenue decreased $137 million or 11 percent to $1.1 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2008, due to a decrease of 6 percent in average owned lending balances and lower yields. Cardmember lending finance revenue during the nine months ended September 30, 2008, decreased $79 million or 2 percent compared to the same period a year ago to $3.4 billion primarily due to a lower portfolio yield due to the impact of the reduced market interest rates on variably priced loans, partially offset by 6 percent growth in average owned lending balances. Cardmember lending interest expense of $290 million and $940 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2008, respectively, decreased $112 million or 28 percent and $138 million or 13 percent as compared to a year ago, reflecting a lower cost of funds in both periods and lower average owned lending balances in the third quarter 2008. Charge card and other interest expense decreased $96 million or 37 percent and $229 million or 31 percent to $161 million and $507 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2008, respectively, due to the impact of lower cost of funds, partially offset by slight growth in business volumes during both periods.   Securitization income, net decreased $192 million or 49 percent and $310 million or 26 percent for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2008, respectively, due to lower excess spread, net, driven by increased write-offs, partially offset by higher finance charge and fees revenue due to a greater average balance of securitized loans and lower interest expense due to lower rates paid on investor certificates, and a reduction in the fair value of the interest-only strip.   Expenses increased $115 million or 6 percent and $460 million or 8 percent for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2008, respectively, primarily due to higher marketing, promotion, rewards and cardmember services costs and greater human resources and other operating expenses. There were no reengineering charges in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2008, and the three months ended September 30, 2007, as compared to $13 million of reengineering charges for the nine months ended September 30, 2007, primarily relating to restructuring activities in the U.S. card business.   53        Marketing, promotion, rewards and cardmember services expenses of $1.2 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2008, increased $54 million or 5 percent due to greater rewards costs and cardmember services costs, which were partially offset by lower marketing and promotion expenses. Marketing, promotion, rewards and cardmember services expenses of $3.6 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2008, increased $228 million or 7 percent primarily due to volume driven increased rewards and cardmember services costs and higher marketing and promotion expenses compared to a reduced spending level in the first half of 2007. Human resources and other operating expenses of $909 million and $2.7 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2008, respectively, increased $61 million or 7 percent and $232 million or 9 percent from a year ago. The increase was primarily due to higher technologies investment, increased credit and collection costs, and increased professional services fees in both periods and the pension-related gain in the year ago period as previously mentioned.   Provisions for losses of $941 million and $3.3 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2008, respectively, increased $303 million or 47 percent and $1.5 billion or 80 percent due to higher write-off and delinquency rates within the U.S. portfolio and the lending reserve addition in the second quarter of 2008, as well as increased average loan volumes partially offset by the $151 million and $269 million net benefit from cardmember loan sales and maturities of securitized loans for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2008, respectively.   The effective tax rate was 33 percent and 28 percent for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2008, respectively, and 35 percent and 34 percent for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2007. The effective tax rate in the three month period ended September 30, 2008, reflected $22 million of the previously mentioned benefits related to the resolution of certain prior years’ tax items while the effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2008, reflected $102 million of the tax benefits discussed previously. The effective tax rate during the three months ended September 30, 2007, reflected $18 million of the tax benefit discussed previously, while the effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2007, reflected an additional $56 million of the tax benefit from the IRS related to the treatment of the prior years’ card fee income as previously discussed.   Differences between GAAP and Managed Basis Presentation   For U.S. Card Services, the managed basis presentation assumes that there have been no off-balance sheet securitization transactions, i.e., all securitized cardmember loans and related income effects are reflected as if they were in the Company’s balance sheets and income statements, respectively. For the managed basis presentation, revenue and expenses related to securitized cardmember loans are reflected in other commissions and fees (included in discount revenue, net card fees and other in the U.S. Card Services Selected Financial Information), cardmember lending finance revenue, cardmember lending interest expense, and provisions for losses. On a managed basis, there is no securitization income, net as the managed basis presentation assumes no securitization transactions have occurred.   The Company presents U.S. Card Services information on a managed basis because that is the way the Company’s management views and manages the business. Management believes that a full picture of trends in the Company’s cardmember lending business can only be derived by evaluating the performance of both securitized and non-securitized cardmember loans. Management also believes that use of a managed basis presentation presents a more accurate picture of the key dynamics of the cardmember lending business. Irrespective of the on- and off-balance sheet funding mix, it is important for management and investors to see metrics for the entire cardmember lending portfolio because they are more representative of the economics of the aggregate cardmember relationships and ongoing business performance and trends over time. It is also important for investors to see the overall growth of cardmember loans and related revenue in order to evaluate market share. These metrics are significant in evaluating the Company’s performance and can only be properly assessed when all non-securitized and securitized cardmember loans are viewed together on a managed basis. The Company does not currently securitize international loans.   On a GAAP basis, revenue and expenses from securitized cardmember loans are reflected in the Company’s income statements in securitization income, net, fees and commissions, and provisions for    54        losses for cardmember lending. At the time of a securitization transaction, the securitized cardmember loans are removed from the Company’s balance sheet, and the resulting gain or loss on sale is reflected in securitization income, net. There is also an impact to provisions for losses (credit reserves are no longer recorded for the cardmember loans once sold). Over the life of a securitization transaction, the Company recognizes servicing fees and other net revenues (referred to as “excess spread”) related to the interests sold to investors (i.e., the investors’ interests). These amounts, in addition to changes in the fair value of the interest-only strip, are reflected in securitization income, net and fees and commissions. The Company also recognizes cardmember lending finance revenue over the life of the securitization transaction related to the interest it retains (i.e., the seller’s interest). At the maturity of a securitization transaction, cardmember loans on the balance sheet increase, and the impact of the incremental required loss reserves is recorded in provisions for losses.   As presented, in aggregate over the life of a securitization transaction, the pretax income impact to the Company is the same whether or not the Company had securitized cardmember loans or funded these loans through other financing activities (assuming the same financing costs). The income statement classifications, however, of specific items will differ.

For the managed basis presentation, revenue and expenses related to securitized cardmember loans are reflected in other commissions and fees (included above in discount revenue, net card fees and other), cardmember lending finance revenue, cardmember lending interest expense, and provisions for losses. On a managed basis, there is no securitization income, net as the managed basis presentation assumes no securitization transactions have occurred.   55        Results of Operations for the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2008 and 2007 – Managed Basis   The following discussion of U.S. Card Services is on a managed basis.   Discount revenue, net card fees and other increased $46 million or 2 percent and $339 million or 4 percent as compared to the same period a year ago to $2.7 billion and $8.3 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2008, respectively, largely due to increases in billed business volumes and higher net card fees, partially offset by lower other investment and interest income in both periods and a decrease in other commissions and fees in the third quarter. Cardmember lending finance revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2008, decreased $75 million or 4 percent as the 8 percent growth in average lending balances was more than offset by a lower portfolio yield, reflecting the impact of reduced market interest rates on variably priced loans. Cardmember lending finance revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2008, increased $229 million or 4 percent primarily due to 14 percent growth in the average managed lending balances, partially offset by a lower portfolio yield as compared to a year ago.   Cardmember lending interest expense decreased $218 million or 31 percent and $387 million or 20 percent as compared to a year ago to $486 million and $1.5 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2008, respectively, due to a lower cost of funds, which more than offset higher average managed lending balances.   Provisions for losses increased $706 million or 82 percent and $2.3 billion or 93 percent to $1.6 billion and $4.8 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2008, respectively, reflecting the impact of higher write-off and delinquency rates within the U.S. portfolio and the lending reserve addition in the second quarter of 2008, as previously mentioned, as well as increased average managed loan volumes.

(b) Return on average segment capital is calculated by dividing (i) segment income ($247 million and $458 million for the one year periods ended September 30, 2008 and 2007, respectively) by (ii) average segment capital ($2.1 billion and $1.9 billion for the one year periods ended September 30, 2008 and 2007, respectively). Return on average tangible segment capital is computed in the same manner as return on average segment capital except the computation of average tangible segment capital excludes average goodwill and other intangibles of $544 million and $541 million at September 30, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The Company believes that return on average tangible segment capital is a useful measure of the profitability of its business growth.   (c) In the third quarter of 2008, the Company revised its method of reporting the cardmember lending net write-off rate. Historically, the net write-off rate has been presented using net write-off amounts for principal, interest, and fees. However, industry convention is generally to include only the net write-offs related to principal in write-off rate disclosures. The Company is presenting the net write-off rate using the net write-off amounts for principal only, consistent with industry convention.   (d) Net finance revenue, which represents cardmember lending finance revenue (including interest and fees) less cardmember lending interest expense, is computed on an annualized basis. Reserves and net write-offs related to interest and fees are recorded through Provisions for losses - Cardmember lending.   Results of Operations for the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2008 and 2007   International Card Services reported segment income of $67 million for the three months ended September 30, 2008, a $73 million or 52 percent decrease from $140 million for the same period a year ago. For the nine months ended September 30, 2008, International Card Services reported segment income of $315 million, a $44 million or 12 percent decrease from $359 million for the same period a year ago.   Revenues net of interest expense increased $118 million or 11 percent and $541 million or 17 percent for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2008, respectively, to $1.2 billion and $3.7 billion due to increased discount revenue, net card fees and other, and higher cardmember lending finance revenue, partially offset by higher interest expense.   57        Discount revenue, net card fees and other revenues of $1.0 billion and $3.1 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2008, respectively, rose $70 million or 7 percent and $377 million or 14 percent as compared to a year ago, driven primarily by the higher level of card spending, increased net card fees, greater other revenues and higher other commissions and fees. The 11 percent and 17 percent increase in billed business for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2008, respectively, reflected an 8 percent and a 15 percent increase in average spending per proprietary basic card, and a 4 percent increase in total cards-in-force for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2008.   For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2008, adjusting for the impacts of foreign exchange translation, billed business increased 8 percent and 9 percent, respectively, and average spending per proprietary basic cards-in-force increased 5 percent and 7 percent, respectively. Volume growth within the major geographic regions ranged from the high single-digits to low double-digits.   Cardmember lending finance revenue of $432 million and $1.3 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2008, respectively, rose $79 million or 22 percent and $284 million or 29 percent as compared to the same periods a year ago, primarily due to 13 percent and 16 percent growth in average lending balances and a higher portfolio yield. Cardmember lending interest expense increased $31 million or 25 percent and $107 million or 30 percent for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2008, due to higher average loan balances and an increased cost of funds. Charge card and other interest expense of $66 million for the three months ended September 30, 2008 remained unchanged as compared to the same period a year ago. For the nine months ended September 30, 2008, charge card and other interest expense increased $13 million or 7 percent to $193 million reflecting higher debt funding levels and higher cost of funds.   Expenses of $915 million and $2.7 billion increased $108 million or 13 percent and $453 million or 20 percent for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2008, respectively, due to increased human resources and other operating expenses and higher marketing, promotion, rewards and cardmember services costs. The reengineering costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2008, included a $1 million reversal compared to $7 million of reengineering costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2007, relating primarily to restructuring activities in the international payments business.   Marketing, promotion, rewards and cardmember services expenses of $388 million and $1.2 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2008, respectively, increased $34 million or 10 percent and $222 million or 24 percent as compared to the same period a year ago, reflecting greater marketing and promotion expenses, higher volume-related rewards costs and an increase in the ultimate redemption rate assumption for the International Membership Rewards program. Human resources and other operating expenses increased $74 million or 16 percent and $231 million or 17 percent to $527 million and $1.6 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2008, respectively, primarily due to an increased number of employees, merit increases, greater professional services expense and higher occupancy and other expense.   Provisions for losses of $316 million and $787 million increased $119 million or 60 percent and $195 million or 33 percent for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2008, respectively, primarily driven by higher lending reserve levels in Mexico, increased delinquency and write-off rates and loan and business volume growth.   The effective tax rate was not meaningful for the three months ended September 30, 2008 as compared to (27) percent for the three months ended September 30, 2007, because it reflected a low level of pretax income. The effective tax rate was (65) percent and (20) percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2008 and 2007, respectively. As indicated in prior quarters, these rates reflected an overall tax benefit that will likely continue going forward since the Company’s internal tax allocation process provides International Card Services with the consolidated benefit related to its ongoing funding activities outside the United States.   58        Global Commercial Services Selected Income Statement Data   (Millions)              Three Months Ended       Nine Months Ended                 September 30,       September 30,                 2008       2007       2008       2007         Revenues                                         Discount revenue, net card fees and other       $   1,309       $   1,180       $   3,984       $   3,488         Interest expense                                         Charge card and other       109       116       332       347         Revenues net of interest expense       1,200       1,064       3,652       3,141         Expenses                                         Marketing, promotion, rewards and cardmember services       113       86       298       252         Human resources and other operating expenses       836       749       2,457       2,181         Total       949       835       2,755       2,433         Provisions for losses       60       42       162       108         Pretax segment income       191       187       735       600         Income tax provision       57       52       223       174         Segment income       $   134       $   135       $   512       $   426          Global Commercial Services Selected Statistical Information   (Billions, except percentages and where indicated)              Three Months Ended       Nine Months Ended                 September 30,       September 30,                 2008       2007       2008       2007         Card billed business       $   32.3       $   29.9       $   100.5       $   89.9         Total cards-in-force (millions)       7.0       6.8       7.0       6.8         Basic cards-in-force (millions)       7.0       6.8       7.0       6.8         Average basic cardmember spending (dollars)       $   4,611       $   4,389       $   14,465       $   13,316         Global Corporate Travel:                                         Travel sales       $   5.1       $   4.9       $   16.7       $   15.0         Travel commissions and fees/sales       8.0   %   8.0   %   7.6   %   7.7   %     Total segment assets       $   23.6       $   21.8       $   23.6       $   21.8         Segment capital (millions) (a)       $   3,564       $   2,230       $   3,564       $   2,230         Return on average segment capital (b)       21.2   %   26.2   %   21.2   %   26.2   %     Return on average tangible segment capital (b)       43.9   %   44.3   %   43.9   %   44.3   %     Cardmember receivables:                                         Total receivables       $   12.5       $   12.5       $   12.5       $   12.5         90 days past due as a % of total       1.8   %   1.6   %   1.8   %   1.6   %     Net loss ratio as a % of charge volume       0.15   %   0.11   %   0.12   %   0.10   %       (a) Segment capital represents capital allocated to a segment based upon specific business operational needs, risk measures, and regulatory capital requirements.   (b) Return on average segment capital is calculated by dividing (i) segment income ($622 million and $543 million for the one year periods ended September 30, 2008 and 2007, respectively) by (ii) average segment capital ($2.9 billion and $2.1 billion for the one year periods ended September 30, 2008 and 2007, respectively). Return on average tangible segment capital is computed in the same manner as return on average segment capital except the computation of average tangible segment capital excludes average goodwill and other intangibles of $1.5 billion and $843 million at September 30, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The Company believes that return on average tangible segment capital is a useful measure of the profitability of its business growth.   59        Results of Operations for the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2008 and 2007   Global Commercial Services reported segment income of $134 million for the three months ended September 30, 2008, a $1 million or 1 percent decrease from $135 million for the same period a year ago. For the nine months ended September 30, 2008, Global Commercial Services reported segment income of $512 million, an $86 million or 20 percent increase from the same period a year ago.   Revenues net of interest expense increased $136 million or 13 percent and $511 million or 16 percent for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2008, respectively, to $1.2 billion and $3.7 billion due to increased discount revenue, net card fees and other and lower interest expense.   Discount revenue, net card fees and other revenues of $1.3 billion and $4.0 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2008, respectively, rose $129 million or 11 percent and $496 million or 14 percent for the same period compared to a year ago, driven primarily by higher card spending, higher other revenues and increased travel revenues. The 8 percent and 12 percent increase in billed business for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2008, reflected a 5 percent and 9 percent increase in average spending per proprietary basic card, respectively, and a 3 percent increase in basic cards-in-force for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2008.   For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2008, adjusting for the impacts of foreign exchange translation, billed business increased 7 percent and 9 percent, and average spending per proprietary basic card-in-force increased 4 percent and 6 percent, respectively. Volume growth of 5 percent and 7 percent within the U.S. compared to growth within the Company’s other major geographic regions ranged from the high single-digits to 20 percent and from the low double-digits to 21 percent for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2008, respectively.   Charge card and other interest expense decreased $7 million or 6 percent and $15 million or 4 percent to $109 million and $332 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2008, respectively, due to a lower cost of funds, primarily within the U.S., partially offset by the cost of funding the CPS acquisition.   Expenses of $949 million and $2.8 billion increased $114 million or 14 percent and $322 million or 13 percent for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2008, respectively, primarily due to higher human resources expenses. Reengineering costs for the three months ended September 30, 2008 and 2007, were $1 million and $9 million, respectively, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2008 and 2007, were $2 million and $20 million, respectively, relating primarily to ongoing restructuring activities in the corporate travel business.   Human resources and other operating expenses increased $87 million or 12 percent and $276 million or 13 percent to $836 million and $2.5 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2008, respectively, due to higher other operating expenses and greater human resources expenses as well as the pension-related gain in the first quarter of 2007.   Marketing, promotions, rewards and cardmember services expenses increased $27 million or 31 percent and $46 million or 18 percent to $113 million and $298 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2008, respectively, primarily reflecting a reallocation of rewards reserve costs for linked corporate and consumer accounts from the USCS segment, as well as higher volume-related rewards costs.   Provisions for losses increased $18 million or 43 percent to $60 million for the three months ended September 30, 2008, and $54 million or 50 percent to $162 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2008, primarily reflecting higher loss and past due rates.   The effective tax rate was 30 percent for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2008. The effective tax rate was 28 percent and 29 percent for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2007.   60        Global Network & Merchant Services Selected Income Statement Data   (Millions)              Three Months Ended       Nine Months Ended                 September 30,       September 30,                 2008       2007       2008       2007         Revenues                                         Discount revenue, fees and other       $   1,016       $   902       $   2,984       $   2,589         Interest expense                                         Cardmember lending       (24   )   (33   )   (75   )   (92   )     Other       (31   )   (45   )   (98   )   (142   )     Revenues net of interest expense       1,071       980       3,157       2,823         Expenses                                         Marketing and promotion       150       151       435       430         Human resources and other operating expenses       481       417       1,398       1,199         Total       631       568       1,833       1,629         Provisions for losses       43       23       137       13         Pretax segment income       397       389       1,187       1,181         Income tax provision       139       123       407       413         Segment income       $   258       $   266       $   780       $   768          Global Network & Merchant Services Selected Statistical Information   (Billions, except percentages and where indicated)              Three Months Ended       Nine Months Ended                 September 30,       September 30,                 2008       2007       2008       2007         Global Card billed business(a)       $   175.5       $   162.5       $   522.8       $   469.8         Global Network & Merchant Services:                                         Total segment assets       $   8.0       $   4.6       $   8.0       $   4.6         Segment capital (millions) (b)       $   1,437       $   1,125       $   1,437       $   1,125         Return on average segment capital (c)       82.4   %   84.7   %   82.4   %   84.7   %     Return on average tangible segment capital (c)       84.7   %   87.5   %   84.7   %   87.5   %     Global Network Services:                                         Card billed business       $   18.2       $   14.1       $   51.4       $   36.9         Total cards-in-force (millions)       24.0       19.2       24.0       19.2           (a) Global Card billed business includes activities (including cash advances) related to proprietary cards, cards issued under network partnership agreements, and certain insurance fees charged on proprietary cards.   (b) Segment capital represents capital allocated to a segment based upon specific business operational needs, risk measures, and regulatory capital requirements.   (c) Return on average segment capital is calculated by dividing (i) segment income ($1.0 billion and $969 million for the one year periods ended September 30, 2008 and 2007, respectively) by (ii) average segment capital ($1.3 billion and $1.1 billion for the one year periods ended September 30, 2008 and 2007). Return on average tangible segment capital is computed in the same manner as return on average segment capital except the computation of average tangible segment capital excludes average goodwill and other intangibles of $34 million and $36 million at September 30, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The Company believes that return on average tangible segment capital is a useful measure of the profitability of its business growth.   61        Results of Operations for the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2008 and 2007   Global Network & Merchant Services reported segment income of $258 million for the three months ended September 30, 2008, an $8 million or 3 percent decrease from $266 million for the same period a year ago. For the nine months ended September 30, 2008, Global Network & Merchant Services reported segment income of $780 million, a $12 million or 2 percent increase from the same period a year ago.   Revenues net of interest expense grew $91 million or 9 percent and $334 million or 12 percent for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2008, respectively, to $1.1 billion and $3.2 billion due to increased discount revenue, fees and other revenues and a reduced interest expense credit due to a lower effective cost of funds on charge card-related internal transfer pricing and a lower rate-driven interest credit related to internal transfer pricing, which recognizes the merchant services’ accounts payable-related funding benefit. Higher discount revenue, fees and other revenues reflected growth in merchant-related revenues, primarily from the 8 percent and 11 percent increase for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2008, respectively, in global card billed business, as well as higher global network services-related revenues.   Expenses increased $63 million or 11 percent and $204 million or 13 percent for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2008, respectively, to $631 million and $1.8 billion primarily reflecting increases in human resources and other operating expenses.   Marketing and promotion expenses of $150 million for the three months ended September 30, 2008, decreased $1 million or 1 percent reflecting lower brand-related expenses. For the nine months ended September 30, 2008, marketing and promotion expenses of $435 million increased $5 million or 1 percent as compared to the same period a year ago, reflecting higher partner-related advertising costs. Human resources and other operating expenses of $481 million and $1.4 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2008, respectively, increased $64 million or 15 percent and $199 million or 17 percent, primarily due to greater human resources expense, which reflected an expansion of the merchant sales force, as well as other higher volume-related expenses.   Provisions for losses of $43 million and $137 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2008, respectively, increased $20 million and $124 million, reflecting an increase in merchant-related reserves due to the generally weaker U.S. economic conditions. The increase in the merchant-related reserves relates to a higher estimated fair value of guarantees provided to protect cardmembers against billing disputes, primarily for the non-delivery of goods and services.   The effective tax rate was 35 percent and 34 percent for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2008, respectively. The effective tax rate was 32 percent and 35 percent for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2007, respectively. The effective tax rate during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2007, reflected $22 million of the tax benefit previously discussed, which principally related to the resolution of certain prior years’ tax items.   Corporate & Other   Results of Operations for the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2008 and 2007   Corporate & Other had net income of $158 million and $170 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2008, respectively, compared with net expense of $11 million and $101 million for the same periods a year ago. The income for the three months ended September 30, 2008, primarily reflected the $93 million and $43 million of after-tax income related to the MasterCard and Visa litigation settlements, respectively, and $56 million in tax benefits related to the revision of the Company’s estimated annual effective tax rate.   The income for the nine months ended September 30, 2008, primarily reflected the $93 million and $129 million after-tax income related to the MasterCard and Visa litigation settlements, respectively, offset by a    62        $19 million after-tax charge (including $5 million of reengineering costs noted below) primarily relating to the ongoing AEB operations retained by the Company in the first quarter of 2008. Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2008 and 2007, also included $15 million and $4 million after-tax of reengineering costs, respectively.   OTHER REPORTING MATTERS   Accounting Developments   See “Recently Issued Accounting Standards” section of Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.   ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK   Market risk is the risk to earnings or values resulting from movements in market rates or prices in the interest rate, foreign exchange or equity markets. The Company’s market risk consists primarily of interest rate risk in its card businesses and foreign exchange risk in its international operations. As described in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2007 (see “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk”), and as adjusted for AEIDC being accounted for as a discontinued operations beginning in the third quarter of 2008 and as restated for all periods presented, the detrimental effect on the Company’s pretax earnings of continued operations of a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in benchmark interest rates would be approximately $210 million, and of a 10 percent strengthening of the U.S. dollar related to anticipated overseas operating results for the next 12 months would hypothetically be approximately $115 million, based on year-end positions. These sensitivities are based on the hypothetical assumption that all relevant maturities and types of benchmark interest rates and foreign exchange rates that affect the Company’s results would increase instantaneously and simultaneously and to the same degree. These interest rate sensitivities primarily reflect mismatches in the repricing frequency of assets and the underlying liabilities, including the impact of hedging activity. These would include, among other things, the impact of an increase in LIBOR rates in charge card interest expense and the interest expense, and thus net interest margin, on fixed-rate lending receivables. There have been no material changes in the sensitivities to this type of market risk since December 31, 2007.   The actual impact of interest rate and foreign exchange rate changes will depend on, among other factors, the timing of rate changes, the extent to which different rates do not move in the same direction or in the same direction to the same degree, and changes in the volume and mix of the Company’s businesses. For example, the Company is also subject to market risk from changes in the relationship between the benchmark prime rate that determines the yield on its variable-rate lending receivables and the benchmark LIBOR rate that determines the effective interest cost on a significant portion of its outstanding debt, including asset securitizations. Simultaneous and identically-sized changes in the same direction of these two indices do not contribute to the market risk described above, as there is no material mismatch in the effective repricing frequency of these two indices. However, differences in the rate of change of these two indices, commonly referred to as basis risk, will impact the Company’s variable-rate U.S. lending net interest margin. The Company currently has approximately $44 billion of prime-based, variable-rate U.S. lending receivables that are funded with LIBOR-indexed debt, including asset securitizations. Historically, the spread between 1 month LIBOR and the Fed Funds rate has averaged 20 basis points. Recently, this spread was as high as approximately 300 basis points, although it has subsequently declined from those levels.   63        ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   The Company’s management, with the participation of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on such evaluation, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of such period, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective. There have not been any changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the fiscal quarter to which this report relates that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.   Forward-Looking Statements   This report includes forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. The forward-looking statements, which address the Company’s expected business and financial performance, among other matters, contain words such as “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “optimistic,” “intend,” “plan,” “aim,” “will,” “may,” “should,” “could,” “would,” “likely,” and similar expressions. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date on which they are made. The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the following: consumer and business spending on the Company’s credit and charge card products and Travelers Cheques and other prepaid products and growth in card lending balances, which depend in part on the economic environment, and the ability to issue new and enhanced card and prepaid products, services and rewards programs, and increase revenues from such products, attract new Cardmembers, reduce Cardmember attrition, capture a greater share of existing Cardmembers’ spending, and sustain premium discount rates on its card products in light of regulatory and market pressures, increase merchant coverage, retain Cardmembers after low introductory lending rates have expired, and expand the Global Network Services business; the Company’s ability to manage credit risk related to consumer debt, business loans, merchants and other credit trends, which will depend in part on the economic environment, including, among other things, the housing market, the rates of bankruptcies and unemployment, which can affect spending on card products, debt payments by individual and corporate customers and businesses that accept the Company’s card products, and on the effectiveness of the Company’s credit models; the impact of the Company’s efforts to deal with delinquent Cardmembers in the current challenging economic environment, which may affect payment patterns of Cardmembers, the Company’s near-term write-off rates, including during the remainder of 2008 and in 2009, and the volumes of the Company’s loan balances in 2008 and 2009; the write-off and delinquency rates in the medium- to long-term of Cardmembers added by the Company during the past few years, which could impact their profitability to the Company; the Company’s ability to effectively implement changes in the pricing of certain of its products and services;

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; the Company’s ability to grow its business, generate excess capital and, over time, meet or exceed its return on shareholders’ equity target by reinvesting approximately 35 percent of annually-generated capital,    64        and returning approximately 65 percent of such capital to shareholders which will depend on the Company’s ability to manage its capital needs and the effect of business mix, acquisitions and rating agency requirements; the success of the Global Network Services business in partnering with banks in the United States, which will depend in part on the extent to which such business further enhances the Company’s brand, allows the Company to leverage its significant processing scale, expands merchant coverage of the network, provides Global Network Services’ bank partners in the United States the benefits of greater Cardmember loyalty and higher spend per customer, and merchant benefits such as greater transaction volume and additional higher spending customers;

the success, timeliness and financial impact (including costs, cost savings, and other benefits, including increased revenues), and beneficial effect on the Company’s operating expense to revenue ratio, both in the short-term (including during 2009) and over time, of reengineering initiatives being implemented or considered by the Company, including cost management, structural and strategic measures such as vendor, process, facilities and operations consolidation, outsourcing (including, among others, technologies operations), relocating certain functions to lower-cost overseas locations, moving internal and external functions to the internet to save costs, and planned staff reductions relating to certain of such reengineering actions; the Company’s ability to reinvest the benefits arising from such reengineering actions in its businesses; bankruptcies, restructurings, consolidations or similar events (including, among others, the proposed Delta Airlines/Northwest Airlines merger) affecting the airline or any other industry representing a significant portion of the Company’s billed business, including any potential negative effect on particular card products and services and billed business generally that could result from the actual or perceived weakness of key business partners in such industries; the triggering of obligations to make payments to certain co-brand partners, merchants, vendors and customers under contractual arrangements with such parties under certain circumstances; a downturn in the Company’s businesses and/or negative changes in the Company’s and its subsidiaries’ credit ratings, which could result in contingent payments under contracts, decreased liquidity and higher borrowing costs; the ability of the Company to satisfy its liquidity needs and execute on its funding plans, which will depend on, among other things, the Company’s future business growth, its credit ratings, market capacity and demand for securities offered by the Company, performance by the Company’s counterparties under its bank credit facilities and other lending facilities, regulatory changes, including changes to the policies, rules and regulations of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, the Company’s ability to securitize and sell receivables and the performance of receivables previously sold in securitization transactions and the Company’s ability to meet the criteria for participation in certain liquidity facilities and other funding programs, including the Commercial Paper Funding Facility and the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program, being made available through the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and other federal departments and agencies; the Company’s ability to redeem or otherwise access in a timely manner up to $500 million invested in the Primary Reserve Fund, from which redemptions have been currently suspended; accuracy of estimates for the fair value of the assets in the Company’s investment portfolio and, in particular, those investments that are not readily marketable, including the valuation of the interest-only strip relating to the Company’s lending securitizations;

changes in laws or government regulations; the potential impact of regulations proposed by federal bank regulators relating to certain credit and charge card practices, including, among others, the imposition by card issuers of interest rate increases on outstanding balances and the allocation of payments in respect of outstanding balances with different    65        interest rates, which could have an adverse impact on the Company’s net income; accounting changes; outcomes and costs associated with litigation and compliance and regulatory matters; and competitive pressures in all of the Company’s major businesses. A further description of these and other risks and uncertainties can be found in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2007, Item 1A of Part 2 and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and the Company’s other reports filed with the SEC.   PART II. OTHER INFORMATION   AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY   ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS   The Company and its subsidiaries are involved in a number of legal and arbitration proceedings, including class actions, concerning matters arising in connection with the conduct of their respective business activities. The Company believes it has meritorious defenses to each of these actions and intends to defend them vigorously. In the course of its business, the Company and its subsidiaries are also subject to governmental examinations, information gathering requests, subpoenas, inquiries and investigations. The Company believes that it is not a party to, nor are any of its properties the subject of, any pending legal, arbitration, regulatory, tax or investigative proceedings that would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial condition or liquidity. However, it is possible that the outcome of any such proceeding could have a material impact on results of operations in any particular reporting period as the proceedings are resolved. Certain legal proceedings involving the Company are described below. For a discussion of certain other legal proceedings involving the Company and its subsidiaries, please refer to the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2007.   Corporate Matters   Beginning in mid-July 2002, 12 putative class action lawsuits were filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. In October 2002, these cases were consolidated under the caption In re American Express Company Securities Litigation. These lawsuits allege violations of the federal securities laws and the common law in connection with alleged misstatements regarding certain investments in high-yield bonds and write-downs in the 2000-2001 timeframe. The purported class covers the period from July 26, 1999 to July 17, 2001. The actions seek unspecified compensatory damages as well as disgorgement, punitive damages, attorneys’ fees and costs, and interest. On March 31, 2004, the Court granted the Company’s motion to dismiss the lawsuit. Plaintiffs appealed the dismissal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. In August 2006, the Court of Appeals, without expressing any views whatsoever on the merits of the cases, vacated the District Court’s judgment and remanded all claims to the District Court for further proceedings. More particularly, the Court of Appeals reversed the District Court’s ruling that two of the plaintiff’s claims in an amended complaint did not “relate back” to the original complaint and were thus time-barred under the statute of limitations period. As a result, the Court of Appeals decided that it was prudent to remand all claims back to the District Court so that plaintiffs could file a new amended complaint. Plaintiffs filed their amended complaint on January 5, 2007. On or about March 6, 2007, the Company filed a motion to strike the amended complaint, which the District Court denied on July 24, 2007. The Company subsequently filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint, which motion was granted in September 2008.   In January 2006, a purported class action captioned Paula Kritzman, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated v. American Express Retirement Plan et al. was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The plaintiff alleges that when the American Express Retirement Plan (the AXP Plan) was amended effective July 1, 1995, to convert from a final average pay formula to a “cash balance” formula for the calculation of benefits, the terms of the amended AXP Plan violated the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, as amended (ERISA), in at least the following ways: (i) the AXP Plan violated ERISA’s prohibition on reducing rates of benefit accrual due to the increasing age of a plan    66        participant; (ii) the AXP Plan violated ERISA’s prohibition on forfeiture of accrued benefits; and (iii) the AXP Plan violated ERISA’s present value calculation rules. The plaintiff seeks, among other remedies, injunctive relief entitling the plaintiff and the purported class to benefits that are the greater of (x) the benefits to which the members of the class would have been entitled without regard to the conversion of the benefit payout formula of the AXP Plan to a cash balance formula and (y) the benefits under the AXP Plan with regard to the cash balance formula. The plaintiff also seeks pre- and post-judgment interest and attorneys’ fees and expenses. The Company has filed a motion with the Court seeking to dismiss the complaint. In July 2008, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit issued a decision in a case not involving American Express, captioned Hirt v. Equitable Retirement Plan for Employees, Managers and Agents, finding that cash balance plans do not discriminate based on age. In light of the Second Circuit’s decision in the Hirt case, the Kritzman plaintiffs have voluntarily dismissed their complaint.   In May 2008, a shareholders’ derivative suit was filed in New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan naming American Express Company and certain current and former directors and senior executives as defendants. The case captioned as City of Tallahassee Retirement System v. Akerson et al. alleges breaches of fiduciary duty “arising from knowing breaches of fiduciary obligations by certain current and former officers and directors of the Company that have led to the imposition of deferred criminal charges on a bank that at the time such charges were entered was owned by American Express, as well as the Company’s payment of approximately $65 million in penalties to federal and state regulators” related to American Express Bank Limited’s (AEBL) and TRS’s anti-money laundering programs. The complaint also states that the sale of AEBL took place after American Express had “allowed the value of its banking business unit to be dramatically impaired on account of the systemic violations of law and resulting deferred criminal charges”. The complaint seeks monetary damages on behalf of the Company. The defendants have filed a motion to dismiss the complaint and are awaiting a ruling from the Court.   U.S. Card Services and Global Merchant Services Matters   The Company has been named in a number of purported class actions in which the plaintiffs allege an unlawful antitrust tying arrangement between the Company’s charge cards, credit cards and debit cards in violation of various state and federal laws, including the following: (i) Cohen Rese Gallery et al. v. American Express Company et al. , U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (filed July 2003); (ii) Italian Colors Restaurant v. American Express Company et al. , U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (filed August 2003); (iii) DRF Jeweler Corp. v. American Express Company et al. , U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York (filed December 2003); (iv) Hayama Inc. v. American Express Company et al. , Superior Court of California, Los Angeles County (filed December 2003); (v) Chez Noelle Restaurant v. American Express Company et al. , U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York (filed January 2004); (vi) Mascari Enterprises d/b/a Sound Stations v. American Express Company et al. , U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York (filed January 2004); (vii) Mims Restaurant v. American Express Company et al. , U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York (filed February 2004); and (viii)  The Marcus Corporation v. American Express Company et al. , U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York (filed July 2004). The plaintiffs in these actions seek injunctive relief and an unspecified amount of damages. Upon motion to the Court by the Company, the venue of the Cohen Rese and Italian Colors actions was moved to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York (SDNY) in December 2003. Each of the above-listed actions (except for Hayama) is now pending in the SDNY under the consolidated caption “In re American Express Merchants’ Litigation”. On April 30, 2004, the Company filed a motion to dismiss all the actions filed prior to such date that were pending in the SDNY, and on March 15, 2006, such motion was granted, with the Court finding the claims of the plaintiffs to be subject to arbitration. Plaintiffs asked the Court to reconsider its dismissal. That request was denied. The plaintiffs have appealed the Court’s arbitration ruling. In addition, during the pendency of the motion in the SDNY, the Company had asked the California Superior Court hearing the Hayama action referenced above to stay that action pending resolution of such motion. The Company also filed a motion to dismiss the action filed by the Marcus Corporation, which was denied in July 2005. On October 1, 2007, plaintiffs filed a motion seeking    67        certification of a class. The Company has opposed plaintiffs’ motion for class certification. In addition, each of the Company and the plaintiffs have moved for summary judgment in their favor.   In July 2004, a purported class action captioned Ross, et al. v. American Express Company, American Express Travel Related Services and American Express Centurion Bank was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The complaint alleges that AMEX conspired with Visa, MasterCard and Diners Club in the setting of foreign conversion rates and in the inclusion of arbitration clauses in certain of their cardmember agreements. The suit seeks injunctive relief and unspecified damages. The class is defined as “all Visa, MasterCard and Diners Club general purpose cardholders who used cards issued by any of the MDL Defendant Banks....” American Express cardholders are not part of the class. In September 2005, the Court denied the Company’s motion to dismiss the action and preliminarily certified an injunction class of Visa and MasterCard cardholders to determine the validity of Visa’s and MasterCard’s cardmember arbitration clauses. American Express filed a motion for reconsideration with the District Court, which motion was denied in September 2006. The Company filed an appeal from the District Court’s order denying its motion to compel arbitration. In October 2008, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit denied the Company’s appeal and remanded the case to the District Court for further proceedings.   In January 2006, in a matter captioned Hoffman, et al. v. American Express Travel Related Services Company, Inc., No. 2001-02281, Superior Court of the State of California, County of Alameda, the Court certified a class action against TRS. In a case management order dated April 8, 2008, the Court defined two classes as follows: (1) all persons who obtained American Express charge cards governed by New York law with billing addresses in California who purchased American Express’ fee based travel related insurance plans from September 6, 1995, through February 12, 2008, and (2) all persons who obtained American Express charge cards governed by New York law with billing addresses in states other than California who purchased American Express’ fee based travel related insurance plans from September 6, 1995, through February 12, 2008. The Court denied the plaintiff’s motion to certify a class to pursue claims on behalf of persons who held American Express credit cards governed by Utah law. Plaintiffs allege that American Express violated California and New York law by allegedly billing customers for flight and baggage insurance that they did not receive. American Express denies the allegations. American Express filed a motion for summary judgment asking that the case be dismissed as a matter of law. The summary judgment motion was partially granted in July 2008 when the Court dismissed certain claims against American Express including claims for punitive damages. Certain other claims survived summary judgment. A trial on the remaining claims is now scheduled for November 2008. In addition, a matter making related allegations to those raised in the Hoffman case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York. That matter, captioned Environment Law Enforcement Systems v. American Express et al., has effectively been stayed pending the proceedings in the Hoffman action.   In June 2006, a putative class action captioned Homa v. American Express Company et al. was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey. The case alleges, generally, misleading and fraudulent advertising of the “tiered” “up to 5 percent” cash rebates with the Blue Cash card. The complaint initially sought certification of a nationwide class consisting of “all persons who applied for and received an American Express Blue Cash card during the period from September 30, 2003 to the present and who did not get the rebate or rebates provided for in the offer.” On December 1, 2006, however, plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint dropping the nationwide class claims and asserting claims only on behalf of New Jersey residents who “while so residing in New Jersey, applied for and received an American Express Blue Cash card during the period from September 30, 2003 to the present.” The plaintiff seeks unspecified damages and other unspecified relief that the Court deems appropriate. In May 2007, the Court granted the Company’s motion to compel individual arbitration and dismissed the complaint. Plaintiff has filed a Notice of Appeal of that decision with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. The appeal has been fully briefed and argument is expected to occur in December 2008.   In June 2008, five separate lawsuits were filed against American Express Company in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York alleging that the Company’s “anti-steering” rules in its merchant acceptance agreements violate federal antitrust laws. The five suits were filed by each of Rite-Aid Corp.,    68        CVS Pharmacy Inc., Walgreen Co., Bi-Lo LLC., and H.E. Butt Grocery Company. The plaintiff in each action seeks damages and injunctive relief. The plaintiffs filed each action as “related” to the case captioned as In re Payment Interchange Fee and Merchant Discount Antitrust Litigation (Docket No. MD 05-1720), which was filed in the Eastern District of New York against Visa, MasterCard and certain others in 2005 (the Interchange Litigation). American Express is not a party to the Interchange Litigation. The federal magistrate assigned to the Interchange litigation issued an order directing the five plaintiffs in the actions filed against American Express to “show cause” why he should not direct the clerk to reassign each such action to a randomly selected presiding district judge and to a randomly selected magistrate judge for purposes of pretrial supervision. The magistrate ruled that the actions against the Company were not related to the Interchange litigation and directed that each of the actions be assigned to a district judge and magistrate at random. American Express’ time to respond to the suits has been extended to January 2009.   International Matters   In May 2006, in a matter captioned Marcotte v. Bank of Montreal et al., filed in the Superior Court of Quebec, District of Montreal (originally filed in April 2003) the Court authorized a class action against Amex Bank of Canada, Bank of Montreal, Toronto-Dominion Bank, Royal Bank of Canada, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Scotiabank, National Bank of Canada, Laurentian Bank of Canada and Citibank Canada. The action alleges that conversion commissions made on foreign currency transactions are credit charges under the Quebec Consumer Protection Act (the QCPA) and cannot be charged prior to the 21-day grace period under the QCPA. The class includes all persons holding a credit card issued by one of the defendants to whom fees were charged since April 17, 2000, for transactions made in foreign currency before expiration of the period of 21 days following the statement of account. The class claims reimbursement of all foreign currency conversions, CDN$400 per class member for trouble, inconvenience and punitive damages, interest and fees and costs. The trial in the Marcotte action commenced in September 2008 and is expected to run through November 2008.   In November 2006, in a matter captioned Sylvan Adams v. Amex Bank of Canada filed in the Superior Court of Quebec, District of Montreal (originally filed in November 2004), the Court authorized a class action against Amex Bank of Canada. The plaintiff alleges that prior to December 2003, Amex Bank of Canada charged a foreign currency conversion commission on transactions to purchase goods and services in currencies other than Canadian dollars and failed to disclose the commissions in monthly billing statements or solicitations directed to prospective cardmembers. The class, consisting of all Cardmembers in Quebec that purchased goods or services in a foreign currency prior to December 2003, claims reimbursement of all foreign currency conversion commissions, CDN$1,000 in punitive damages per class member, interest and fees and costs. The trial in the Adams action is scheduled to commence in December 2008 after the conclusion of the trial in the Marcotte action.   Other Matters   During the last few years as regulatory interest in credit card network pricing to merchants and related issues has increased, the Company has responded to many inquiries from banking and competition authorities throughout the world. On October 14, 2008, the Company received a Civil Investigative Demand (CID), dated October 10, 2008, from the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice (DOJ). A CID is a request for information in the course of a civil investigation and does not constitute the commencement of legal proceedings. The DOJ is permitted by statute to issue a CID to anyone whom it believes may have information relevant to an investigation. The receipt of a CID does not presuppose that there is probable cause to believe that a violation of the antitrust laws has occurred or that a formal complaint ultimately will be filed. The DOJ has requested the production of documents and information regarding the Company’s policies relating to merchant surcharging and its “anti-steering” policies that prohibit merchants from discriminating against the Card in favor of other forms of payment. The Company intends to cooperate with the DOJ’s request.   69        ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS   This section supplements and updates certain of the information found under Item 1A. “Risk Factors” of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2007 (the “2007 Form 10-K”), and should be read in conjunction with the discussion of risk factors set forth in such section. Based on the information currently known to us, the Company believes that the matters discussed below, together with the risk factors set forth in the 2007 Form 10-K, identify the most significant risk factors affecting the Company. However, the risks and uncertainties that the Company faces are not limited to those described below and those set forth in the 2007 Form 10-K. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect the Company’s business and the trading price of its securities.   Adverse capital and credit market conditions may significantly affect the Company’s ability to meet liquidity needs, access to capital and cost of capital.   The money and capital markets have been experiencing extreme volatility and disruption for more than 12 months, which have negatively impacted market liquidity conditions. In recent weeks, the volatility and disruption have reached unprecedented levels.   The concerns on the part of market participants have focused on a broad range of mortgage-and asset-backed and other fixed income securities, including those rated investment grade, the U.S. and international credit and interbank money markets generally, and a wide range of financial institutions and markets, asset classes and sectors. As a result, the market for fixed income instruments has experienced decreased liquidity, increased price volatility, credit downgrade events and increased probability of default. Securities that are less liquid are more difficult to value and may be hard to dispose of. Domestic and international equity markets have also been experiencing heightened volatility and turmoil, with issuers (such as the Company) that have exposure to or rely on the credit markets particularly affected.   The Company needs liquidity to pay operating expenses, interest on debt and dividends on capital stock and to repay maturing liabilities. Without sufficient liquidity, the Company could be forced to limit its investments in growth opportunities or curtail operations. The principal sources of the Company’s liquidity are payments from cardmembers, cash flow from our investment portfolio and assets, consisting mainly of cash or assets that are readily convertible into cash, and issuances of commercial paper. Sources of liquidity in normal markets also include a variety of short- and long-term instruments, including medium- and long-term unsecured debt and the securitization of the Company’s credit card loan and charge card receivables.   Notwithstanding the Company’s solid financial position, the Company is not immune from the pressures brought on by the current crisis in the financial markets. The fragility of the credit markets and the current economic environment have impacted financial services companies through market volatility and fluctuations, loss of confidence and rating agency actions. Similar to other financial services firms, the Company’s access to the capital markets has been significantly limited since mid-September 2008, it has seen a downgrade of its long-term credit ratings by one of the major ratings agencies, and its stock price has declined significantly.   In the event current sources of liquidity, including internal sources, do not satisfy the Company’s needs, it would be required to seek additional financing. The availability of additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions, the general availability of credit, the overall availability of credit to the financial services industry, the Company’s credit ratings and credit capacity, as well as the possibility that lenders could develop a negative perception of the Company’s long- or short-term financial prospects if it incurs large credit losses or if the level of its business activity decreased due to an economic downturn. Similarly, the Company’s access to funds may be impaired if regulatory authorities or rating agencies take negative actions against us. In addition, certain sources of contingent liquidity, including the CPFF and the TLGP, being made available through the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and other federal departments and agencies, are subject to the Company’s ability to meet or continue to meet the criteria for participation in such facilities and programs and are temporary in nature as such programs are scheduled to terminate on various dates in the second quarter of 2009.   Disruptions, uncertainty or volatility in the capital and credit markets may also limit the Company’s access to capital required to operate our business. Such market conditions may limit its ability to replace, in a timely manner, maturing liabilities, satisfy regulatory capital requirements and access the capital necessary to grow its business. As such, the Company may be forced to delay raising capital, issue shorter-tenured securities than it prefers, or bear an unattractive cost of capital, which could decrease profitability    70        and significantly reduce financial flexibility. In addition, during the year, the Company’s credit spreads have widened considerably.   If current levels of market disruption and volatility continue or worsen, there can be no assurance that we will not experience an adverse effect, which may be material, on our ability to access capital and on our business, financial condition and results of operations.   Difficult conditions in the global capital markets and the economy generally may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations, and we do not expect these conditions to improve in the near future.   The Company’s results of operations are materially affected by conditions in the global capital markets and the economy generally, both in the United States and elsewhere around the world. The stress experienced by global capital markets that began in the second half of 2007 continued and substantially increased during the third quarter of 2008.   Recently, concerns over the availability and cost of credit, the U.S. mortgage market, a declining real estate market in the United States (in particular, in those markets in which the Company has generated significant spend volume on its charge and credit card products) and geopolitical issues have contributed to increased volatility and diminished expectations for the economy and the markets going forward. These factors, combined with volatile oil prices, declining business and consumer confidence and increased unemployment, have precipitated an economic slowdown and fears of a global recession, which may cause declines in credit and charge card usage and has already resulted in adverse changes in payment patterns, causing increases in delinquencies and default rates. If the performance of its charge card and credit card portfolios continues to weaken through increasing delinquencies and write-offs, the Company’s long-term and short-term debt ratings could be downgraded and its access to capital could be materially adversely affected and cost of capital could increase.   These events and the continuing market upheavals may have an adverse effect on the Company, in part because we are dependent upon consumer and business behavior. Our revenue growth is likely to decline in such circumstances and, in certain instances, revenues may decrease, and our profit margins could erode. In addition, in the event of extreme prolonged market adversity, such as the global credit crisis, the Company could incur significant losses.   Factors such as consumer spending, business investment, government spending, the volatility and strength of the capital markets and inflation all affect the business and economic environment and, ultimately, the Company’s profitability. An economic downturn characterized by higher unemployment, lower family income, lower corporate earnings, lower business investment and lower consumer spending could materially and adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.   The lack of available credit, lack of confidence in the financial markets, reduced consumer and business spending, and worsening credit metrics also pose other risks to Company’s results of operations and financial conditions. In particular, the Company may face the following risks, among others, in connection with these events:   · The processes the Company uses to estimate losses may no longer be reliable because they rely on complex judgments, including forecasts of economic conditions, that may no longer be capable of accurate estimation.   · The Company’s ability to assess the creditworthiness of its customers may be impaired if the models and approaches it uses to select, manage, and underwrite credit to its customers become less predictive of future charge-offs.   · In the event that (i) the three-month average rate of excess spread earned on credit card loans securitized by the Company falls below zero or (ii) the Company’s undivided, pro rata interest in the securitization trust established by the Company for credit card loans represents less than 7    71        percent of the outstanding securities in the Lending Trust (or 15 percent of the total receivables in the Charge Trust), then such trust would be required to amortize earlier than scheduled, which would accelerate its need for additional funding and have a significant effect on the ability of certain of its business entities to meet capital adequacy requirements.   · In the event that the three-month average rate of excess spread earned on credit card loans securitized by the Company falls below 5 percent for the Lending Trust or 4 percent for the Charge Trust the securitization trusts established by the Company for credit card loans and charge card receivables, respectively, would be required to fund a cash reserve account of up to approximately $2 billion or $207 million, respectively, depending on how low the applicable excess spread falls.   Some of the financial, economic and market related risks we described in “Risk Factors” in our 2007 Form 10-K referred to above have come to pass. As these conditions or similar ones continue to exist or worsen, we could experience continuing or increased adverse effects on our results of operations and financial condition.   The impairment of other financial institutions could adversely affect the Company.   The Company’s ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial services institutions. Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships. The Company routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, investment banks and insurance companies. Defaults or non-performance by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services institutions, or the financial services industry generally, have led to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by one or more of the Company’s counterparties, which in turn, could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.   Any reduction in the Company’s and its subsidiaries credit ratings could increase the cost of our funding from and restrict the Company’s access to the capital markets and have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.   Although the Company’s and its subsidiaries’ long-term debt is currently rated investment grade (at “A” levels) by the major rating agencies, the ratings of that debt have been downgraded during 2008 by Moody’s Investors Services (Moody’s), one of the major rating agencies, and continue to remain on negative outlook by such rating agency. In addition, Standard & Poor’s (S&P), another major rating agency, has placed the Company’s long-term debt on “Creditwatch” with negative implications. The rating agencies regularly evaluate the Company and its subsidiaries, and their ratings of the Company’s and its subsidiaries long-term and short-term debt are based on a number of factors, including their financial strength as well as factors not entirely within their control, including conditions affecting the financial services industry generally. In light of the difficulties in the financial services industry and the financial markets, there can be no assurance that the Company and its subsidiaries will maintain their current respective ratings. Failure to maintain those ratings could, among other things, adversely limit the Company’s access to the capital markets and adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which the Company and its subsidiaries are able to obtain funding and increase our cost of capital.   In addition, although each of Moody’s and S&P has recently affirmed the Company’s and its subsidiaries short-term debt ratings, a downgrade of the short-term ratings of the Company’s TRS subsidiary below its current P-1 rating by Moody’s and A-1 rating by S&P would require TRS, as servicer to the Company’s securitization    72        trusts, to transfer collections on the securitized assets to investors on a daily, rather than a monthly, basis or make alternative arrangements with the rating agencies to allow TRS to continue to transfer collections on a monthly basis. Such alternative arrangements include obtaining appropriate guarantees for the performance of payment and deposit obligations of TRS, as servicer. The downgrade of TRS’s short-term ratings and the consequent increased operational costs of daily collections or the costs associated with the making of any alternative arrangements could have an adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations and may adversely affect the market for the Company’s asset-backed securities.   In addition, a downgrade of the short-term ratings of the Company’s American Express Credit Corporation subsidiary below its current P-1/A-1/F1 ratings by two or more rating agencies would restrict such company’s ability to participate in the CPFF established by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s liquidity and its ability to fund charge card receivables and credit card loans.   The Company cannot predict what actions rating agencies may take. As with other companies in the financial services industry, the Company’s and its subsidiaries ratings could be downgraded at any time and without any notice by any of the rating agencies.   The Company competes with large financial institutions, some of which have recently strengthened their capital positions with substantial new investments.   The Company’s credit and charge card businesses encounter substantial and intense competition in the United States and internationally from banking and other financial services companies. As a result of the implementation of the Capital Purchase Program (CPP) initiated by the U.S. Department of the Treasury (the Treasury) under the Troubled Asset Relief Program, several of the Company’s banking competitors have received multi-billion dollar infusions of capital from the Treasury in the form of preferred stock, which have strengthened their respective balance sheets and increased their ability to withstand the uncertainty of the current economic environment. The Company is currently participating in two federal programs – the Commercial Paper Funding Facility and the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program – and is evaluating the CPP.   Certain rules proposed by federal bank regulators, if adopted as proposed, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.   In May 2008, federal bank regulators in the United States proposed amendments to the rules regarding Unfair or Deceptive Acts or Practices and Truth in Lending that would restrict certain credit and charge card practices and require expanded disclosures to consumers. The proposed rules would, among other things:   · Prohibit interest rate increases on outstanding credit card balances except under limited circumstances; · In the case of accounts with different annual percentage rates (“APR”) on different balances, prohibit the application of payments to the lowest-rate balances first; · Prohibit the imposition of a higher or default APR on existing balances unless an account is 30 days past due; and · Require that consumers be provided with a certain, reasonable amount of time to make credit card payments.   The Federal Reserve Board has indicated it hopes to publish final rules by the end of the year. We do not know the content of the final amendments nor the resulting impact from the amendments at this time. The Company has submitted comments on the proposals to federal regulators and is continuing to evaluate the proposals, but if the regulatory amendments are adopted as proposed and the Company were not to take offsetting actions to mitigate their impact, the amendments would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations.   73        ITEM 2.
