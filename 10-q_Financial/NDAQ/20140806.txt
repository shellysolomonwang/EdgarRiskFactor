Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements   1. Organization and Nature of Operations    We are a leading global exchange group that delivers trading, clearing, exchange technology, regulatory, securities listing, and public company services across six continents. Our global offerings are diverse and include trading and clearing across multiple asset classes, access services, market data products, financial indexes, capital formation solutions, financial services, corporate solutions and market technology products and services. Our technology powers markets across the globe, supporting derivatives trading, clearing and settlement, cash equity trading, fixed income trading and many other functions.    In the U.S., we operate The NASDAQ Stock Market, a registered national securities exchange. The NASDAQ Stock Market is the largest single cash equities securities market in the U.S. in terms of listed companies and in the world in terms of share value traded. As of June 30, 2014, The NASDAQ Stock Market was home to 2,709 listed companies with a combined market capitalization of approximately $7.6 trillion. In addition, in the U.S. we operate two additional cash equities trading markets, three options markets and an electronic platform for trading of U.S. Treasuries. In March 2014, we launched NASDAQ Private Market, or NPM, a marketplace for private growth companies.   In Europe, we operate exchanges in Stockholm (Sweden), Copenhagen (Denmark), Helsinki (Finland), and Iceland, as well as the clearing operations of NASDAQ OMX Clearing AB, as NASDAQ OMX Nordic. We also operate exchanges in Tallinn (Estonia), Riga (Latvia) and Vilnius (Lithuania) as NASDAQ OMX Baltic. Collectively, NASDAQ OMX Nordic and NASDAQ OMX Baltic offer trading in cash equities, bonds, structured products and ETFs, as well as trading and clearing of derivatives and clearing of resale and repurchase agreements. Through NASDAQ OMX First North, our Nordic and Baltic operations also offer alternative marketplaces for smaller companies. As of June 30, 2014, the exchanges that comprise NASDAQ OMX Nordic and NASDAQ OMX Baltic, together with NASDAQ OMX First North, were home to 782 listed companies with a combined market capitalization of approximately $1.3 trillion. We also operate NASDAQ OMX Armenia.    In addition, NASDAQ OMX Commodities operates a power derivatives exchange regulated in Norway and a European carbon exchange. In the U.K., we operate NASDAQ OMX NLX, a London-based market for trading of listed short-term and long-term European (Euro and Sterling denominated) interest rate derivative products.    In some of the countries where we operate exchanges, we also provide investment firm, clearing, settlement and central depository services.   2. Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation    The condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP. The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NASDAQ OMX, its wholly-owned subsidiaries and other entities in which NASDAQ OMX has a controlling financial interest. The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments which are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair statement of the results for the interim periods presented. These adjustments are of a normal recurring nature. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.    As permitted under U.S. GAAP, certain footnotes or other financial information can be condensed or omitted in the interim condensed consolidated financial statements. The information included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in NASDAQ OMX’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2013.   Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.   The preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and the disclosure of contingent amounts in the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.    We have evaluated subsequent events through the issuance date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.    Tax Matters    We use the asset and liability method to determine income taxes on all transactions recorded in the condensed consolidated financial statements. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities (i.e., temporary differences) and are measured at the enacted rates that will be in effect when these differences are realized. If necessary, a valuation allowance is established to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized.        6     Table Of Contents   In order to recognize and measure our unrecognized tax benefits, management determines whether a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. Once it is determined that a position meets the recognition thresholds, the position is measured to determine the amount of benefit to be recognized in the condensed consolidated financial statements. Interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters are recognized in income tax expense.   As shown in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income, the income tax benefit in the second quarter and first six months of 2013 was impacted due to an assertion made by NASDAQ OMX to permanently reinvest the earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries. As a result of this assertion, adjustments were made to our deferred tax balances relating to cumulative translation adjustments pertaining to these subsidiaries.   NASDAQ OMX and its eligible subsidiaries file a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return and applicable state and local income tax returns and non-U.S. income tax returns. Federal income tax returns for the years 2007 through 2010 are currently under audit by the Internal Revenue Service and we are subject to examination for 2011 and 2012. Several state tax returns are currently under examination by the respective tax authorities for the years 2005 through 2012. Non-U.S. tax returns are subject to examination by the respective tax authorities for the years 2006 through 2012. We anticipate that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits at June 30, 2014 will significantly decrease in the next twelve months as we expect to settle certain tax audits. The final outcome of such audits cannot yet be determined. We anticipate that such adjustments will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.    In the fourth quarter of 2010, we received an appeal from the Finnish Tax Authority challenging certain interest expense deductions claimed by NASDAQ OMX in Finland for the year 2008. The appeal also demanded certain penalties be paid with regard to the company’s tax return filing position. In October 2012, the Finnish Appeals Board disagreed with the company’s tax return filing position for years 2009 through 2011, even though the tax return position with respect to this deduction was previously reviewed and approved by the Finnish Tax Authority. In June 2014, the Finnish Administrative Court also disagreed with the company’s tax return filing position. Through June 30, 2014, we have recorded tax benefits of $21 million associated with this filing position. Of this amount we have paid $12 million to the Finnish tax authorities. We have also paid $11 million in interest and penalties. In 2014, we will pay $9 million, which represents the benefit taken in 2013 and the first six months of 2014. We expect the Finnish Supreme Administrative Court to agree with our position, which would result in an expected refund to NASDAQ OMX of $32 million.    From 2009 through 2012, we recorded tax benefits associated with certain interest expense incurred in Sweden. Our position is supported by a 2011 ruling we received from the Swedish Supreme Administrative Court. However, under new legislation effective January 1, 2013, limitations are imposed on certain forms of interest expense. Because this legislation is unclear with regard to our ability to continue to claim such interest deductions, NASDAQ OMX filed an application for an advance tax ruling with the Swedish Tax Council for Advance Tax Rulings. In June 2014, we received an unfavorable ruling from the Swedish Tax Council for Advance Tax Rulings. We will appeal this ruling to the Swedish Supreme Administrative Court. We expect to receive a favorable decision from the Swedish Supreme Administrative Court. Since January 1, 2013, we have recorded tax benefits of $24 million, or $0.14 per diluted share, related to this matter. We expect to record recurring quarterly tax benefits of $4 million to $5 million with respect to this issue for the foreseeable future.    In December 2012, the Swedish Tax Agency approved our 2010 amended value added tax, or VAT, tax return and we received a cash refund for the amount claimed. In 2013, we filed VAT tax returns for 2011 and 2012 and utilized the same approach which was approved for the 2010 filing. However, even though the VAT return position was previously reviewed and approved by the Swedish Tax Agency, we were informed by the Swedish Tax Agency that our VAT refund claims for 2011 and 2012 are not valid. However, they will not seek reimbursement of the 2010 refund. We have appealed the finding by the Swedish Tax Agency to the Administrative Court. For the period January 1, 2011 through June 30, 2014, we have recorded benefits of $16 million associated with this position.   Recently Announced Accounting Pronouncements   In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606),” which supercedes the revenue recognition guidance in Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, 605, “Revenue Recognition.” The new revenue recognition standard sets forth a five-step revenue recognition model to determine when and how revenue is recognized. The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. The standard also requires more detailed disclosures. The standard provides alternative methods of initial adoption and is effective for us on January 1, 2017. Early adoption is not permitted. We are currently assessing the impact that this standard will have on our consolidated financial statements.   In April 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-08, “Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity,” which raises the threshold for a disposal to qualify as a discontinued operation and requires new disclosures of both discontinued operations and certain other disposals that do not meet the definition of a discontinued operation. Under the new guidance, only disposals representing a strategic shift in operations that have or will have a major effect on an entity’s operations and financial results should be presented as discontinued operations. This guidance is effective for us on January 1,      7     Table Of Contents   2015. Early adoption is permitted provided that the disposal was not previously disclosed. We will prospectively apply this new standard to applicable transactions.   3. Restructuring Charges    During the first quarter of 2012, we performed a comprehensive review of our processes, organizations and systems in a company-wide effort to improve performance, cut costs, and reduce spending. This restructuring program was completed in the first quarter of 2013.    The following table presents a summary of restructuring charges in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income for the six months ended June 30, 2013:                                                          Six Months Ended June 30,               2013                                  (in millions)      Severance        $  6 				     Facilities-related          1 				     Asset impairments          1 				     Other          1 				     Total restructuring charges        $  9 				        During the first six months of 2013, we recognized restructuring charges totaling $9 million, including severance costs of $6 million related to workforce reductions of 31 positions across our organization, $1 million for facilities-related charges related to lease rent accruals for facilities we no longer occupy due to facilities consolidation, $1 million for asset impairments, primarily consisting of fixed assets and capitalized software that have been retired, and $1 million of other charges.    Restructuring Reserve    Severance    The accrued severance balance was $3 million at December 31, 2013 and is included in other current liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The accrued severance balance as of December 31, 2013 was paid during the first quarter of 2014.    Facilities-related    Facilities-related reserves are calculated using a present value of future minimum lease payments, offset by an estimate for future sublease income. The facilities-related reserve balance was $1 million at December 31, 2013. The majority of the facilities-related reserve balance as of December 31, 2013 was utilized during the first quarter of 2014.       4. Acquisitions   We completed the following acquisitions in 2014 and 2013. Financial results of each transaction are included in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income from the dates of each acquisition.       2014 Acquisition   On March 31, 2014, we completed the acquisition of the remaining 28% ownership interest in BWise Beheer B.V. and its subsidiaries, or BWise, a Netherlands-based service provider that offers enterprise governance, risk management and compliance software and services to help companies track, measure and manage key organizational risks. BWise is part of our Market Technology business within our Technology Solutions segment.    2013 Acquisitions                                                                                                                                     Purchase Consideration        Total Net Assets (Liabilities) Acquired        Purchased Intangible Assets        Goodwill                                                                          (in millions)      eSpeed        $  1,239 				       $  5 				       $  715 				       $  519 				     TR Corporate Solutions businesses          366 				         (37) 				         91 				         312 				    Acquisition of eSpeed for Trading of U.S. Treasuries       8     Table Of Contents   On June 28, 2013, we acquired from BGC Partners, Inc. and certain of its affiliates, or BGC, certain assets and assumed certain liabilities, including 100% of the equity interests in eSpeed Technology Services, L.P., eSpeed Technology Services Holdings, LLC, Kleos Managed Services, L.P. and Kleos Managed Services Holdings, LLC; the eSpeed brand name; various assets comprising the fully electronic portion of BGC’s benchmark U.S. Treasury brokerage, market data and co-location service businesses, or eSpeed, for $1.2 billion. We acquired net assets, at fair value, totaling $5 million and purchased intangible assets of $715 million, which consisted of $578 million for the eSpeed trade name, $121 million in customer relationships and $16 million in technology. The eSpeed businesses are part of our Market Services and Information Services segments.   The purchase price consisted of $755 million in cash and contingent future annual issuances of 992,247 shares of NASDAQ OMX common stock, which approximated certain tax benefits associated with the transaction of $484 million. Such contingent future issuances of NASDAQ OMX common stock will be paid ratably through 2027 if NASDAQ OMX’s total gross revenues equal or exceed $25 million in each such year. The contingent future issuances of NASDAQ OMX common stock are subject to anti-dilution protections and acceleration upon certain events.   We finalized the allocation of the purchase price for eSpeed in the second quarter of 2014. There were no adjustments to the provisional values for this acquisition during the first six months of 2014.    Acquisition of the Investor Relations, Public Relations and Multimedia Solutions Businesses of Thomson Reuters   On May 31, 2013, we acquired from Thomson Reuters their Investor Relations, Public Relations and Multimedia Solutions businesses, or the TR Corporate Solutions businesses, which provide insight, analytics and communications solutions, for $390 million ($366 million cash paid plus $24 million in working capital adjustments). We acquired net liabilities, at fair value, totaling $37 million and purchased intangible assets of $91 million, which consisted of $89 million in customer relationships and $2 million in technology. The TR Corporate Solutions businesses are part of our Corporate Solutions business within our Technology Solutions segment.   We finalized the allocation of the purchase price for the TR Corporate Solutions businesses in the second quarter of 2014. There were no adjustments to the provisional values for this acquisition during the first six months of 2014.    In the first quarter of 2014, we performed a review of our legacy Corporate Solutions’ technology platforms in an effort to leverage our scale and expertise as well as improve the efficiencies that we deliver to our customers and reduce our costs. This review resulted in the consolidation and retirement of several technology platforms, resulting in a charge of $18 million in the first quarter of 2014. In addition, other merger costs of $19 million relating to our acquisition of the TR Corporate Solutions businesses were recorded in the first six months of 2014. These charges are included in merger and strategic initiatives expense in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income.    Formation of The NASDAQ Private Market Joint Venture    In March 2013, we formed a joint venture with SharesPost, Inc. creating NPM, a marketplace for private growth companies. We own a majority interest in NPM, combining NASDAQ OMX’s resources, market and operating expertise with SharesPost’s web-based platform. NPM launched in March 2014 and is part of our U.S. Listing Services business within our Listing Services segment.   We finalized the allocation of the purchase price for NPM in the first quarter of 2014. There were no adjustments to the provisional values for this acquisition during the first quarter of 2014.    EMCF and EuroCCP Merger   In December 2013, European Multilateral Clearing Facility N.V., or EMCF, merged with EuroCCP, creating EuroCCP N.V., a new combined clearinghouse. In connection with the merger, NASDAQ OMX purchased an additional ownership interest in EuroCCP N.V. for an immaterial amount. NASDAQ OMX previously had a 22% equity interest in EMCF and, upon completion of the merger, currently has a 25% equity interest in EuroCCP N.V. We account for our investment in EuroCCP N.V. under the equity method of accounting and this investment is part of our Market Services segment. See “Equity Method Investments,” of Note 6, “Investments,” for further discussion of our equity method investments.   Acquisition of Dutch Cash Equities and Equity Derivatives Trading Venue    In April 2013, we acquired a 25% equity interest in The Order Machine, or TOM, a Dutch cash equities and equity derivatives trading venue, for an immaterial amount. The terms of the transaction also provide us an option to acquire an additional 25.1% of the remaining shares at a future date. This transaction expanded our derivatives presence in Europe and this investment is part of our Market Services segment. We account for our investment in TOM under the equity method of accounting. See “Equity Method Investments,” of Note 6, “Investments,” for further discussion of our equity method investments.   Pro Forma Results and Acquisition-related Costs    Pro forma financial results for the acquisitions completed in 2013 have not been presented since these acquisitions, both individually and in the aggregate, were not material to our financial results.        9     Table Of Contents   Acquisition-related costs for the transactions described above were expensed as incurred and are included in merger and strategic initiatives expense in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income.       5. Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets    Goodwill    The following table presents the changes in goodwill by business segment during the six months ended June 30, 2014:                                                                                                                                                              Market Services        Listing Services        Information Services        Technology Solutions        Total                                                                                  (in millions)      Balance at December 31, 2013        $  3,433 				       $  136 				       $  2,019 				       $  598 				       $  6,186 				     Goodwill acquired             -             -             -             -             -      Foreign currency translation adjustment          (66) 				         (1) 				         (39) 				         (12) 				         (118) 				     Balance at June 30, 2014        $  3,367 				       $  135 				       $  1,980 				       $  586 				       $  6,068 				        As of June 30, 2014, the amount of goodwill that is expected to be deductible for tax purposes in future periods is $844 million, of which $484 million is related to our acquisition of eSpeed and $289 million is related to our acquisition of the TR Corporate Solutions businesses.    Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of a business acquired. Goodwill is allocated to our reporting units based on the assignment of the fair values of each reporting unit of the acquired company. We perform an annual goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year using carrying amounts as of October 1. Should certain events or indicators of impairment occur between annual impairment tests, we will perform the impairment test as those events or indicators occur. We assess goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level. There was no impairment of goodwill for the six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, however, events such as economic weakness or unexpected significant declines in operating results of a reporting unit may result in goodwill impairment charges in the future.    Purchased Intangible Assets    The following table presents details of our total purchased intangible assets, both finite- and indefinite-lived:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      June 30, 2014        December 31, 2013               Gross Amount        Accumulated Amortization        Net Amount        Weighted-Average Useful Life (in Years)        Gross Amount        Accumulated Amortization        Net Amount        Weighted-Average Useful Life (in Years)                                                                                                                      (in millions)                    (in millions)                  Finite-Lived Intangible Assets                                                                                                      Technology        $  37 				       $  (14) 				       $  23 				         5 				       $  39 				       $  (12) 				       $  27 				         5 				     Customer relationships          1,075 				         (325) 				         750 				         19 				         1,075 				         (292) 				         783 				         19 				     Other          6 				         (3) 				         3 				         8 				         5 				         (3) 				         2 				         8 				     Foreign currency translation adjustment          (12) 				         4 				         (8) 				                     3 				            -          3 				                 Total finite-lived intangible assets        $  1,106 				       $  (338) 				       $  768 				                   $  1,122 				       $  (307) 				       $  815 				                                                                                                                        Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets                                                                                                      Exchange and clearing registrations        $  790 				       $     -        $  790 				                   $  790 				       $     -        $  790 				                 Trade names          756 				            -          756 				                     756 				            -          756 				                 Licenses          51 				            -          51 				                     51 				            -          51 				                 Foreign currency translation adjustment          (52) 				            -          (52) 				                     (26) 				            -          (26) 				                 10     Table Of Contents       Total indefinite-lived intangible assets        $  1,545 				       $     -        $  1,545 				                   $  1,571 				       $     -        $  1,571 				                 Total intangible assets        $  2,651 				       $  (338) 				       $  2,313 				                   $  2,693 				       $  (307) 				       $  2,386 				                        Amortization expense for purchased finite-lived intangible assets was $18 million for the three months ended June 30, 2014, $13 million for the three months ended June 30, 2013, $36 million for the six months ended June 30, 2014, and $26 million for the six months ended June 30, 2013.   The estimated future amortization expense (excluding the impact of foreign currency translation adjustment) of purchased finite-lived intangible assets as of June 30, 2014 is as follows:                                                          (in millions)      2014(1)        $  35 				     2015          69 				     2016          67 				     2017          65 				     2018          61 				     2019 and thereafter          479 				     Total        $  776 				         (1) Represents the estimated amortization to be recognized for the remaining six months of 2014.   Intangible Asset Impairment Charges   In the first quarter of 2013, we recorded non-cash intangible asset impairment charges totaling $10 million related to certain acquired intangible assets associated with customer relationships ($7 million) and a certain trade name ($3 million). These impairments resulted primarily from changes in the forecasted revenues associated with the acquired customer list of FTEN, Inc., or FTEN. The fair value of customer relationships was determined using the income approach, specifically the multi-period excess earnings method. The fair value of the trade name was determined using the income approach, specifically the relief from royalty method. These charges are recorded in asset impairment charges in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income for the six months ended June 30, 2013. These impairment charges related to our Market Services segment.    6. Investments    Trading Securities    Trading securities, which are included in financial investments, at fair value in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, were $186 million as of June 30, 2014 and $189 million as of December 31, 2013. These securities are primarily comprised of Swedish government debt securities, of which $172 million as of June 30, 2014 and $167 million as of December 31, 2013, are assets utilized to meet regulatory capital requirements primarily for our clearing operations at NASDAQ OMX Nordic Clearing.    Available-for-Sale Investment Securities   Available-for-sale investment securities, which are included in financial investments, at fair value in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, were $17 million as of June 30, 2014. There were no available-for-sale investment securities as of December 31, 2013. These securities are primarily comprised of short-term commercial paper. For both the three and six months ended June 30, 2014, the unrealized holding gain/(loss) associated with these available-for-sale investment securities was immaterial.    Equity Method Investments    The carrying amounts of our equity method investments totaled $28 million as of June 30, 2014 and $30 million as of December 31, 2013 and are included in other non-current assets in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. At June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013, our equity method investments consisted primarily of our equity interests in EuroCCP N.V. and TOM. See “EMCF and EuroCCP Merger,” and “Acquisition of Dutch Cash Equities and Equity Derivatives Trading Venue,” of Note 4, “Acquisitions,” for further discussion.   Income recognized from our equity interest in the earnings and losses of these equity method investments was immaterial for both the three and six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013.    Cost Method Investments    The carrying amounts of our cost method investments totaled $144 million as of June 30, 2014 and are included in other non-current assets in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of June 30, 2014, our cost method investments represent our 5%      11     Table Of Contents   ownership interest in Borsa Istanbul and our 5% ownership in LCH Clearnet Group Limited, or LCH. As of December 31, 2013, our cost method investment totaled $65 million and consisted of our 5% ownership interest in LCH. We account for these investments as cost method investments as we do not control and do not exercise significant influence over Borsa Istanbul or LCH and there is no readily determinable fair value of these shares since they are not publicly traded.     The Borsa Istanbul shares, which were issued to us in the first quarter of 2014, are part of the consideration to be received under a market technology agreement. This investment has a cost basis of $75 million which is guaranteed to us via a put option negotiated as part of the market technology agreement.   7. Deferred Revenue    Deferred revenue represents consideration received that is yet to be recognized as revenue. At June 30, 2014, we estimate that our deferred revenue, which is primarily Listing Services and Technology Solutions revenues, will be recognized in the following years:                                                                                                                                                          Initial Listing Revenues        Listing of Additional Shares Revenues        Annual Renewal and Other Revenues        Technology Solutions Revenues(2)        Total                                                                                  (in millions)      Fiscal year ended:                                                                  2014(1)        $  7 				       $  18 				       $  98 				       $  57 				       $  180 				     2015          12 				         29 				         2 				         41 				         84 				     2016          10 				         20 				            -          30 				         60 				     2017          8 				         11 				            -          32 				         51 				     2018          6 				         2 				            -          34 				         42 				     2019 and thereafter          5 				            -             -          40 				         45 				              $  48 				       $  80 				       $  100 				       $  234 				       $  462 				        (1) Represents deferred revenue that is anticipated to be recognized over the remaining six months of 2014.   (2) The timing of recognition of our deferred Technology Solutions revenues is primarily dependent upon the completion of customization and any significant modifications made pursuant to existing Market Technology contracts and the timing of Corporate Solutions subscription-based contracts. As such, as it relates to Market Technology revenues, the timing represents our best estimate.        The changes in our deferred revenue during the six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013 are reflected in the following table.

The additions to Technology Solutions revenues during the six months ended June 30, 2014 include $75 million related to the Borsa Istanbul market technology agreement. See “Cost Method Investments,” of Note 6, “Investments,” for further discussion.    (2)  Technology Solutions deferred revenues primarily include revenues from our Market Technology delivered client contracts in the support phase charged during the period and our Corporate Solutions subscription based contracts, which are primarily billed quarterly in advance. For our Market Technology contracts, where customization and significant modifications to the software are made to meet the needs of our customers, total revenues, as well as costs incurred, are deferred until significant modifications are completed and delivered. Once delivered, deferred revenue and the related deferred costs are recognized over the post contract support period. For these Market Technology contracts, we have included the deferral of costs in other current assets and other non-current assets in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The amortization of Technology Solutions      12     Table Of Contents   deferred revenue primarily includes revenues earned from Market Technology client contracts and Corporate Solutions subscription based contracts recognized during the period.            8. Debt Obligations    The following table presents the changes in the carrying amount of our debt obligations during the six months ended June 30, 2014:                                                                                                                                      December 31, 2013        Additions        Payments, Accretion and Other        June 30, 2014                                                                      (in millions)      4.00% senior unsecured notes repaid June 18, 2014(1)        $  400 				       $     -        $  (400) 				       $     -      5.55% senior unsecured notes due January 15, 2020 (net of discount)(1)          598 				            -          1 				         599 				     5.25% senior unsecured notes due January 16, 2018 (net of discount)(1)          368 				            -             -          368 				     3.875% senior unsecured notes due June 7, 2021 (net of discount)(1)          824 				            -          (4) 				         820 				     4.25% senior unsecured notes due June 1, 2024 (net of discount)(1)             -          498 				            -          498 				     $1.2 billion senior unsecured five-year credit facility(2):                                                      $450 million senior unsecured term loan facility credit agreement due September 19, 2016 (average interest rate of 1.53% for the period January 1, 2014 through June 30, 2014)          349 				            -          (226) 				         123 				     $750 million revolving credit commitment due September 19, 2016 (average interest rate of 1.34% for the period January 1, 2014 through June 30, 2014)          95 				         25 				         (120) 				            -      Total debt obligations          2,634 				         523 				         (749) 				         2,408 				     Less current portion          (45) 				            -          45 				            -      Total long-term debt obligations        $  2,589 				       $  523 				       $  (704) 				       $  2,408 				        (1) See “Senior Unsecured Notes” below for further discussion.    (2) See “2011 Credit Facility” below for further discussion.        Senior Unsecured Notes    4.00% and 5.55% Senior Unsecured Notes    In January 2010, NASDAQ OMX issued $1 billion of senior unsecured notes, or the Notes. The Notes were issued at a discount in two separate series consisting of $400 million aggregate principal amount of 4.00% senior notes due 2015, or the 2015 Notes, and $600 million aggregate principal amount of 5.55% senior notes due 2020, or the 2020 Notes. As a result of the discount, the proceeds received from the issuance were less than the aggregate principal amounts. We repaid the outstanding balance on the 2015 Notes in June 2014. See “Early Extinguishment of 2015 Notes” below for further discussion.   Early Extinguishment of 2015 Notes   In May 2014, NASDAQ OMX issued $500 million of 4.25% senior unsecured notes due June 1, 2024, or the 2024 Notes. For further discussion of the 2024 Notes see “4.25% Senior Unsecured Notes” below. In June 2014, we used the majority of the net proceeds from the 2024 Notes, along with cash on hand, to repay in full and terminate our 2015 Notes and repay a portion of the term loan under our senior credit facility. See “4.25% Senior Unsecured Notes” and “2011 Credit Facility” below for further discussion. In connection with the early extinguishment of the 2015 Notes, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $9 million which is included in general, administrative and other expense in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014.    2020 Notes   As of June 30, 2014, the balance of $599 million for the 2020 Notes reflects the aggregate principal amount, less the unamortized debt discount. The unamortized debt discount will be accreted through interest expense over the life of the 2020 Notes.   The 2020 Notes pay interest semiannually at a rate of 5.55% per annum until January 15, 2020. The 2020 Notes are general unsecured obligations of ours and rank equally with all of our existing and future unsubordinated obligations. The 2020 Notes are not      13     Table Of Contents   guaranteed by any of our subsidiaries and were issued under indentures that, among other things, limit our ability to consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets, create liens, and enter into sale and leaseback transactions.    Debt Issuance Costs    We incurred debt issuance and other costs of $5 million in connection with the issuance of the 2020 Notes. These costs, which are capitalized and included in other non-current assets in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, are being amortized over the life of this debt obligation. Amortization expense, which is recorded as additional interest expense for these costs, was immaterial for both the three and six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013.    5.25% Senior Unsecured Notes    In December 2010, NASDAQ OMX issued $370 million of 5.25% senior unsecured notes due January 16, 2018, or the 2018 Notes. The 2018 Notes were issued at a discount. As a result of the discount, the proceeds received from the issuance were less than the aggregate principal amount. As of June 30, 2014, the balance of $368 million reflects the aggregate principal amount, less the unamortized debt discount. The unamortized debt discount will be accreted through interest expense over the life of the 2018 Notes.    The 2018 Notes pay interest semiannually at a rate of 5.25% per annum until January 16, 2018 and such rate may vary with NASDAQ OMX’s debt rating up to a rate not to exceed 7.25%. The 2018 Notes are general unsecured obligations of ours and rank equally with all of our existing and future unsubordinated obligations. They are not guaranteed by any of our subsidiaries. The 2018 Notes were issued under indentures that among other things, limit our ability to consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets, create liens, and enter into sale and leaseback transactions. In addition, upon a change of control triggering event (as defined in the indenture), the terms require us to repurchase all or part of each holder’s notes for cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount purchased plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any.    Debt Issuance Costs    We incurred debt issuance and other costs of $3 million in connection with the issuance of the 2018 Notes. These costs, which are capitalized and included in other non-current assets in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, are being amortized over the life of this debt obligation. Amortization expense, which is recorded as additional interest expense for these costs, was immaterial for both the three and six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013.   3.875% Senior Unsecured Notes    In June 2013, NASDAQ OMX issued €600 million aggregate principal amount of 3.875% senior unsecured notes due June 2021, or the 2021 Notes, at a discount. As a result of the discount, the proceeds received from the issuance were less than the aggregate principal amount. As of June 30, 2014, the balance of $820 million reflects the aggregate principal amount, less the unamortized debt discount. The unamortized debt discount will be accreted through interest expense over the life of the 2021 Notes.    The 2021 Notes pay interest annually at a rate of 3.875% per annum until June 7, 2021 and such rate may vary with NASDAQ OMX’s debt rating up to a rate not to exceed 5.875%. The 2021 Notes are general unsecured obligations of ours and rank equally with all of our existing and future unsubordinated obligations. They are not guaranteed by any of our subsidiaries. The 2021 Notes were issued under indentures that among other things, limit our ability to consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets, create liens, and enter into sale and leaseback transactions. In addition, upon a change of control triggering event (as defined in the indenture), the terms require us to repurchase all or part of each holder’s notes for cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount purchased plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any.    The 2021 Notes have been designated as a hedge of our net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries to mitigate the foreign exchange risk associated with certain investments in these subsidiaries. The decrease in the carrying amount of $4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2014 reflects the translation of the 2021 Notes into U.S. dollars and is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss.   We used the majority of the net proceeds from the offering of the 2021 Notes to fund the cash consideration payable by us for the acquisition of eSpeed and related expenses. We used the remaining proceeds for general corporate purposes. See “Acquisition of eSpeed for Trading of U.S. Treasuries,” of Note 4, “Acquisitions,” for further discussion of our acquisition of eSpeed.    Debt Issuance Costs    We incurred debt issuance and other costs of $7 million in connection with the issuance of the 2021 Notes. These costs, which are capitalized and included in other non-current assets in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, are being amortized over the life of this debt obligation. Amortization expense, which is recorded as additional interest expense for these costs, was immaterial for both the three and six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013.       14     Table Of Contents   4.25% Senior Unsecured Notes    As discussed above in “Early Extinguishment of 2015 Notes,” in May 2014, NASDAQ OMX issued the 2024 Notes. The 2024 Notes were issued at a discount. As a result of the discount, the proceeds received from the issuance were less than the aggregate principal amount. As of June 30, 2014, the balance of $498 million reflects the aggregate principal amount, less the unamortized debt discount. The unamortized debt discount will be accreted through interest expense over the life of the 2024 Notes.    The 2024 Notes pay interest semiannually at a rate of 4.25% per annum until June 1, 2024 and such rate may vary with NASDAQ OMX’s debt rating up to a rate not to exceed 6.25%. The 2024 Notes are general unsecured obligations of ours and rank equally with all of our existing and future unsubordinated obligations. They are not guaranteed by any of our subsidiaries. The 2024 Notes were issued under indentures that among other things, limit our ability to consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets, create liens, and enter into sale and leaseback transactions. In addition, upon a change of control triggering event (as defined in the indenture), the terms require us to repurchase all or part of each holder’s notes for cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount purchased plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any.    We used the majority of the net proceeds from the offering of the 2024 Notes, along with cash on hand, to repay in full and terminate our 2015 Notes and repay a portion of the term loan under our senior credit facility. See “Early Extinguishment of 2015 Notes” above and “2011 Credit Facility” below for further discussion.   Debt Issuance Costs    We incurred debt issuance and other costs of $4 million in connection with the issuance of the 2024 Notes. These costs, which are capitalized and included in other non-current assets in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, are being amortized over the life of this debt obligation. Amortization expense, which is recorded as additional interest expense for these costs, was immaterial for both the three and six months ended June 30, 2014.   Credit Facilities    2011 Credit Facility    In September 2011, NASDAQ OMX entered into a $1.2 billion senior unsecured five-year credit facility which matures on September 19, 2016, or the 2011 Credit Facility. The 2011 Credit Facility consists of a $450 million funded term loan, or the 2016 Term Loan, and a $750 million revolving credit commitment (including a swingline facility and letter of credit facility). NASDAQ OMX applied the $450 million in proceeds from the 2016 Term Loan to repay in full the remaining $450 million principal amount outstanding on our former credit facility. Under the 2011 Credit Facility, we are required to pay quarterly principal payments equal to 2.50% of the original aggregate principal amount borrowed under the 2016 Term Loan. In the first six months of 2014, we made payments of $226 million consisting of a required quarterly principal payment of $22 million and an optional prepayment of $204 million on our 2016 Term Loan, reflecting all mandatory principal payments required until maturity in September 2016. We utilized cash on hand and borrowings from our 2024 Notes to pay the required payment and optional prepayment. See “4.25% Senior Unsecured Notes” above for further discussion.    In the first six months of 2014, we borrowed $25 million under the revolving credit commitment and utilized the proceeds for general corporate purposes. During the first six months of 2014, we repaid the total amount drawn on the revolving credit commitment of $120 million. As of June 30, 2014, availability under the revolving credit commitment was $750 million.    The loans under the 2011 Credit Facility have a variable interest rate based on either the London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, or the Federal Funds Rate, plus an applicable margin that varies with NASDAQ OMX’s debt rating.    The 2011 Credit Facility contains financial and operating covenants. Financial covenants include an interest expense coverage ratio and a maximum leverage ratio. Operating covenants include limitations on NASDAQ OMX’s ability to incur additional indebtedness, grant liens on assets, enter into affiliate transactions and pay dividends. Our credit facilities allow us to pay cash dividends on our common stock as long as certain leverage ratios are maintained. The 2011 Credit Facility also contains customary affirmative covenants, including access to financial statements, notice of defaults and certain other material events, maintenance of business and insurance, and events of default, including cross-defaults to our material indebtedness.    NASDAQ OMX is permitted to repay borrowings under the 2011 Credit Facility at any time in whole or in part, without penalty. We are also required to repay loans outstanding under the 2011 Credit Facility with net cash proceeds from sales of property and assets of NASDAQ OMX and its subsidiaries (excluding inventory sales and other sales in the ordinary course of business) and casualty and condemnation proceeds, in each case subject to specified exceptions and thresholds.    Debt Issuance Costs    We incurred debt issuance and other costs of $5 million in connection with the entry into the 2011 Credit Facility. These costs, which are capitalized and included in other non-current assets in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, are being amortized over the life of the 2011 Credit Facility. Amortization expense, which is recorded as additional interest expense for these costs, was immaterial for both the three and six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013.       15     Table Of Contents   Other Credit Facilities    In addition to the revolving credit commitment under our 2011 Credit Facility discussed above, we have credit facilities related to our Nordic clearing operations in order to provide further liquidity and default protection. At June 30, 2014, these credit facilities, which are available in multiple currencies, primarily Swedish Krona, totaled $317 million ($227 million in available liquidity and $90 million for default protection), none of which was utilized. At December 31, 2013, these facilities totaled $312 million ($219 million in available liquidity and $93 million for default protection), of which $11 million was utilized.    Debt Covenants    At June 30, 2014, we were in compliance with the covenants of all of our debt obligations.   9. Employee Benefits    U.S. Defined-Benefit Pension and Supplemental Executive Retirement Plans    We maintain non-contributory, defined-benefit pension plans, non-qualified supplemental executive retirement plans, or SERPs, for certain senior executives and post-retirement benefit plans for eligible employees in the U.S., collectively referred to as the NASDAQ OMX Benefit Plans.    Our pension plans and SERPs are frozen. Future service and salary for all participants do not count toward an accrual of benefits under the pension plans and SERPs.    Components of Net Periodic Benefit Cost    The following table sets forth the components of net periodic pension, SERP and post-retirement benefits costs from the NASDAQ OMX Benefit Plans recognized in compensation and benefits expense in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income:                                                                                                                                     Three Months Ended June 30,        Six Months Ended June 30,               2014        2013        2014        2013                                                                      (in millions)      Components of net periodic benefit cost                                                      Interest cost        $  1 				       $  1 				       $  3 				       $  3 				     Expected return on plan assets          (1) 				         (1) 				         (3) 				         (3) 				     Recognized net actuarial loss             -          1 				         1 				         2 				     Curtailment loss             -          1 				            -          1 				     Net periodic benefit cost        $     -        $  2 				       $  1 				       $  3 				        Non-U.S. Benefit Plans    Most employees outside the U.S. are covered by local retirement plans or by applicable social laws. Benefits under social laws are generally expensed in the periods in which the costs are incurred. These costs are included in compensation and benefits expense in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and were $5 million for both the three months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, and $10 million for both the six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013.   U.S. Defined Contribution Savings Plan    We sponsor a voluntary defined contribution savings plan, or 401(k) Plan, for U.S. employees. Employees are immediately eligible to make contributions to the plan and are also eligible for an employer contribution match at an amount equal to 100.0% of the first 6.0% of eligible employee contributions in 2014 and the first 4.0% of eligible employee contributions in 2013. Savings plan expense included in compensation and benefits expense in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income was $2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2014, $1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2013, $5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2014, and $3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2013.   We have a profit-sharing contribution feature to our 401(k) Plan which allows eligible U.S. employees to receive employer retirement contributions, or ERCs, when we meet our annual corporate goals. In addition, we have a supplemental ERC for select highly compensated employees whose ERCs are limited by the annual Internal Revenue Service compensation limit. ERC expense recorded in compensation and benefits expense in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income was $1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2014, immaterial for the three months ended June 30, 2013, and $1 million for both the six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013.   In December 2013, we announced changes to the ERC program. In 2014, we reduced the basic ERC contribution for all plan participants and, effective January 1, 2015, the ERC plan will be discontinued and no future contributions will be made.        16     Table Of Contents   Employee Stock Purchase Plan    We have an employee stock purchase plan, or ESPP, under which approximately 2.9 million shares of our common stock have been reserved for future issuance as of June 30, 2014.    Our ESPP allows eligible U.S. and non-U.S. employees to purchase a limited number of shares of our common stock at six-month intervals, called offering periods, at 85.0% of the lower of the fair market value on the first or the last day of each offering period. The 15.0% discount given to our employees is included in compensation and benefits expense in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and was $1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2014, immaterial for the three months ended June 30, 2013, $2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2014, and $1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2013.   10. Share-Based Compensation    We have a share-based compensation program that provides our board of directors broad discretion in creating employee equity incentives. Share-based awards, or equity awards, granted under this program include stock options, restricted stock (consisting of restricted stock units), and performance share units, or PSUs. Grants of equity awards are designed to reward employees for their long-term contributions and provide incentives for them to remain with us. For accounting purposes, we consider PSUs to be a form of restricted stock.    Restricted stock is generally time-based and vests over three- to five-year periods beginning on the date of the grant. Stock options are also generally time-based and expire ten years from the grant date. Stock option and restricted stock awards granted prior to 2014 generally included performance-based accelerated vesting features based on achievement of specific levels of corporate performance. If NASDAQ OMX exceeded the applicable performance parameters, the grants vest on the third anniversary of the grant date, if NASDAQ OMX meets the applicable performance parameters, the grants vest on the fourth anniversary of the grant date, and if NASDAQ OMX does not meet the applicable performance parameters, the grants vest on the fifth anniversary of the grant date. Beginning in 2014, restricted stock awards granted vest 25% on the second anniversary of the grant date, 25% on the third anniversary of the grant date, and 50% on the fourth anniversary of the grant date.    PSUs are based on performance measures that impact the amount of shares that each recipient will receive upon vesting. PSUs are granted at the fair market value of our stock on the grant date and compensation cost is recognized over the performance period and, in certain cases, an additional vesting period. For each grant of PSUs, an employee may receive from 0% to 150% of the target amount granted, depending on the achievement of performance measures. We report the target number of PSUs granted, unless we have determined that it is more likely than not, based on the actual achievement of performance measures, that an employee will receive a different amount of shares underlying the PSUs, in which case we report the amount of shares the employee is likely to receive.    We also have a performance-based long-term incentive program for our chief executive officer, co-presidents, executive vice presidents and senior vice presidents that focuses on total shareholder return, or TSR. This program represents 100% of our chief executive officer’s, co-presidents’ and executive vice presidents’ long-term stock-based compensation and 50% of our senior vice presidents’ long-term stock-based compensation. Under the program, each individual receives PSUs with a three-year cumulative performance period that vest at the end of the performance period. Performance will be determined by comparing NASDAQ OMX’s TSR to two peer groups, each weighted 50%. The first peer group consists of exchange companies, and the second peer group consists of all companies in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, or S&P 500. NASDAQ OMX’s relative performance ranking against each of these groups will determine the final number of shares delivered to each individual under the program. The payout under this program will be between 0% and 200% of the number of PSUs granted and will be determined by NASDAQ OMX’s overall performance against both peer groups. However, if NASDAQ OMX’s TSR is negative for the three-year performance period, regardless of TSR ranking, the payout will not exceed 100% of the number of PSUs granted. We estimate the fair value of PSU’s granted under the TSR program using the Monte Carlo simulation model, as these awards contain a market condition. The following weighted-average assumptions were used to determine the weighted-average fair value of the PSU awards granted under the TSR program for the six months ended June 30, 2014:                                                          Six Months Ended June 30,               2014                                        Weighted-average risk free interest rate          0.79% 				     Expected volatility(1)          29.1% 				     Weighted-average fair value at grant date        $  43.13 				        (1) We use historic volatility for PSU awards issued under the TSR program, as implied volatility cannot be used when simulating multivariate prices for companies in the S&P 500.        17     Table Of Contents   Summary of 2014 Equity Awards    In March 2014, we granted restricted stock to most active employees. During the first six months of 2014, certain officers received grants of 812,985 PSUs. Of these PSUs granted, 548,524 units are subject to the performance measures and vesting schedules of the TSR program as discussed above, and the remaining 264,461 units are subject to a one-year performance period and generally vest ratably on an annual basis from December 31, 2015 through December 31, 2017. See “Summary of Restricted Stock and PSU Activity” below for further discussion.   During 2013, certain grants of PSUs with a one-year performance period exceeded the applicable performance parameters. As a result, an additional 64,330 units were considered granted in the first quarter of 2014.   Common Shares Available Under Our Equity Plan    As of June 30, 2014, we had approximately 7.2 million shares of common stock authorized for future issuance pursuant to NASDAQ OMX’s Equity Incentive Plan.    Summary of Share-Based Compensation Expense    The following table shows the total share-based compensation expense resulting from equity awards and the 15.0% discount for the ESPP for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013 in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income:                                                                                                                                     Three Months Ended June 30,        Six Months Ended June 30,               2014        2013        2014        2013                                                                      (in millions)      Share-based compensation expense before income taxes        $  16 				       $  9 				       $  30 				       $  18 				     Income tax benefit          (6) 				         (4) 				         (12) 				         (7) 				     Share-based compensation expense after income taxes        $  10 				       $  5 				       $  18 				       $  11 				        We estimated the fair value of stock option awards using the Black-Scholes valuation model. No stock option awards were granted during the three and six months ended June 30, 2014 or 2013.   Summary of Stock Option Activity    A summary of stock option activity for the six months ended June 30, 2014 is as follows:                                                                                                                                 Number of Stock Options(1)        Weighted-Average Exercise Price        Weighted-Average Remaining Contractual Term        Aggregate Intrinsic Value                                                                                              (in years)        (in millions)      Outstanding at January 1, 2014          4,926,522 				       $  25.21 				         4.97 				       $  73 				     Exercised          (694,914) 				         18.81 				                             Forfeited or expired          (29,005) 				         23.31 				                             Outstanding at June 30, 2014          4,202,603 				       $  26.29 				         4.41 				       $  53 				     Exercisable at June 30, 2014          4,188,474 				       $  26.31 				         4.40 				       $  52 				         (1) No stock option awards were granted during the three and six months ended June 30, 2014.   We received net cash proceeds of $6 million from the exercise of 327,799 stock options for the three months ended June 30, 2014 and received net cash proceeds of $13 million from the exercise of 694,914 stock options for the six months ended June 30, 2014. We received net cash proceeds of $10 million from the exercise of 1,181,764 stock options for the three months ended June 30, 2013 and received net cash proceeds of $15 million from the exercise of 1,559,189 stock options for the six months ended June 30, 2013. We present excess tax benefits from the exercise of stock options, if any, as financing cash flows.    The aggregate intrinsic value in the above table represents the total pre-tax intrinsic value (i.e., the difference between our closing stock price on June 30, 2014 of $38.62 and the exercise price, times the number of shares) based on stock options with an exercise price less than NASDAQ OMX’s closing price of $38.62 as of June 30, 2014, which would have been received by the option holders had the option holders exercised their stock options on that date. This amount can change based on the fair market value of our common stock. The total number of in-the-money stock options exercisable as of June 30, 2014 was 4.1 million.   As of June 30, 2013, 3.7 million outstanding stock options were exercisable and the weighted-average exercise price was $24.88.    Total fair value of stock options vested was immaterial for both the three months ended June 30, 2014 and June 30, 2013, $11 million for the six months ended June 30, 2014 and immaterial for the six months ended June 30, 2013. The total pre-tax intrinsic      18     Table Of Contents   value of stock options exercised was $6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2014, $27 million for the three months ended June 30, 2013, $14 million for the six months ended June 30, 2014 and $33 million for the six months ended June 30, 2013.    At June 30, 2014, total unrecognized compensation cost related to stock options is immaterial.

(2) PSUs granted in 2014 reflect awards issued to certain officers, as described above.        At June 30, 2014, $114 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to restricted stock and PSUs is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.8 years.   11. NASDAQ OMX Stockholders’ Equity    Common Stock    At June 30, 2014, 300,000,000 shares of our common stock were authorized, 216,640,867 shares were issued and 168,588,156 shares were outstanding. The holders of common stock are entitled to one vote per share, except that our certificate of incorporation limits the ability of any person to vote in excess of 5.0% of the then-outstanding shares of NASDAQ OMX common stock. This limitation does not apply to persons exempted from this limitation by our board of directors prior to the time such person owns more than 5.0% of the then-outstanding shares of NASDAQ OMX common stock.    Common Stock in Treasury, at Cost    We account for the purchase of treasury stock under the cost method with the shares of stock repurchased reflected as a reduction to NASDAQ OMX stockholders’ equity and included in common stock in treasury, at cost in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. When treasury shares are reissued, they are recorded at the average cost of the treasury shares acquired. We held 48,052,711 shares of common stock in treasury as of June 30, 2014 and 45,062,071 shares as of December 31, 2013.    Share Repurchase Program    In the third quarter of 2012, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $300 million of our outstanding common stock. These purchases may be made from time to time at prevailing market prices in open market purchases, privately-negotiated transactions, block purchase techniques or otherwise, as determined by our management. The purchases are funded from existing cash balances. The share repurchase program may be suspended, modified or discontinued at any time.    During the first six months of 2014, we repurchased 2,557,920 shares of our common stock at an average price of $36.46, for an aggregate purchase price of $93 million. During the first six months of 2013, we repurchased 321,000 shares of our common stock at an average price of $31.12, for an aggregate purchase price of $10 million. The shares repurchased under the share repurchase program are available for general corporate purposes. As of June 30, 2014, the remaining amount authorized for share repurchases under the program authorized in the third quarter of 2012 was $122 million.    Other Repurchases of Common Stock    During the six months ended June 30, 2014, we repurchased 590,310 shares of our common stock in settlement of employee tax withholding obligations due upon the vesting of restricted stock.    Preferred Stock    Our certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of 30,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share, issuable from time to time in one or more series. At June 30, 2014, there were no preferred shares issued or outstanding. At December 31, 2013, 1,600,000 shares of series A convertible preferred stock were issued and none were outstanding.       19     Table Of Contents   Cash Dividends on Common Stock    During the six months ended June 30, 2014, our board of directors declared the following cash dividends:                                                                                                             Declaration Date        Dividend Per Common Share        Record Date        Total Amount(1)        Payment Date                                   (in millions)              January 30, 2014        $  0.13 				       March 14, 2014        $  22 				       March 28, 2014      March 26, 2014        $  0.15 				       June 13, 2014        $  25 				       June 27, 2014          (1) These amounts were recorded in retained earnings in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at June 30, 2014.       In July 2014, the board of directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per share on our outstanding common stock. The dividend is payable on September 26, 2014 to shareholders of record at the close of business on September 12, 2014. Future declarations of quarterly dividends and the establishment of future record and payment dates are subject to approval by the board of directors.   12.

For the three months ended June 30, 2014, we included 4,067,186 of the outstanding stock options and 5,346,554 shares of restricted stock and PSUs in the computation of diluted earnings per share, on a weighted-average basis, as their inclusion was dilutive. For the six months ended June 30, 2014, we included 4,069,186 of the outstanding stock options and 4,697,456 shares of restricted stock and PSUs in the computation of diluted earnings per share, on a weighted average basis, as their inclusion was dilutive. The remaining stock options and shares of restricted stock and PSUs are antidilutive, and as such, they were properly excluded.    Stock options to purchase 5,878,593 shares of common stock and 4,769,644 shares of restricted stock and PSUs were outstanding at June 30, 2013. For the three months ended June 30, 2013, we included 4,617,257 of the outstanding stock options and 4,706,334 shares of restricted stock and PSUs in the computation of diluted earnings per share, on a weighted-average basis, as their inclusion was dilutive. For the six months ended June 30, 2013, we included 4,617,257 of the outstanding stock options and 4,676,922 shares of restricted stock and PSUs in the computation of diluted earnings per share, on a weighted-average basis, as their inclusion was dilutive. The remaining stock options and shares of restricted stock and PSUs are antidilutive, and as such, they were properly excluded.   13. Fair Value of Financial Instruments    Fair Value Measurement—Definition and Hierarchy    Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability, or the exit price, in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value measurement establishes a hierarchy of valuation techniques based on whether the inputs to those valuation techniques are observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect NASDAQ OMX’s market assumptions. These two types of inputs create the following fair value hierarchy:    •Level 1—Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.        20     Table Of Contents   •Level 2—Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations whose inputs are observable or whose significant value drivers are observable.    •Level 3—Instruments whose significant value drivers are unobservable.    This hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available.    There were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy as of June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013. The following table presents for each of the above hierarchy levels, our financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013.

Of these securities, $172 million as of June 30, 2014 and $167 million as of December 31, 2013 are assets utilized to meet regulatory capital requirements primarily for clearing operations at NASDAQ OMX Nordic Clearing. As of June 30, 2014, Level 2 financial investments, at fair value were primarily comprised of available-for-sale securities in short-term commercial paper.   (2)Default fund and margin deposit investments include cash contributions invested by NASDAQ OMX Nordic Clearing, in accordance with its investment policy, either in highly rated government debt securities or reverse repurchase agreements with highly rated government debt securities as collateral. Of the total balance of $2,579 million recorded in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of June 30, 2014, $1,692 million of cash contributions have been invested in reverse repurchase agreements and $792 million of cash contributions have been invested in highly rated government debt securities and time deposits. The remainder of this balance is held in cash. Of the total balance of $1,961 million recorded in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2013, $1,093 million of cash contributions were invested in reverse repurchase agreements and $774 million of cash contributions were invested in highly rated government debt securities. The remainder of this balance is held in cash.     Financial Instruments Not Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis    Some of our financial instruments are not measured at fair value on a recurring basis but are recorded at amounts that approximate fair value due to their liquid or short-term nature. Such financial assets and financial liabilities include: cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, receivables, net, certain other current assets, accounts payable and accrued expenses, Section 31 fees payable to SEC, accrued personnel costs, and certain other current liabilities.    In addition, our investments in LCH and Borsa Istanbul are carried at cost. See “Cost Method Investments,” of Note 6, “Investments,” for further discussion.   We also consider our debt obligations to be financial instruments. The fair value of our debt, utilizing discounted cash flow analyses for our floating rate debt and prevailing market rates for our fixed rate debt, was $2.6 billion at June 30, 2014 and $2.8 billion at December 31, 2013. The discounted cash flow analyses are based on borrowing rates currently available to us for debt with similar terms and maturities. Our fixed rate and our floating rate debt are categorized as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. For further discussion of our debt obligations, see Note 8, “Debt Obligations.”           21     Table Of Contents   14. Clearing Operations    Nordic Clearing    In April 2014, we completed the integration of NOS Clearing ASA, or NOS Clearing, a leading Norway-based clearinghouse primarily for OTC traded derivatives for the freight market and seafood derivative market into NASDAQ OMX Nordic Clearing. NASDAQ OMX Nordic Clearing is authorized and supervised as a European multi-asset clearinghouse by the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority, or SFSA, and is authorized to conduct clearing operations in Norway by the Norwegian Ministry of Finance. The clearinghouse acts as the central counterparty, or CCP, for exchange and OTC trades in equity derivatives, fixed income derivatives, physical power, power derivatives, carbon derivatives, resale and repurchase contracts and with the integration of NOS Clearing, freight derivatives and seafood derivatives. In March 2014, NASDAQ OMX became the first European authorized clearinghouse under the new European Union rules. The region's clearinghouses have to reapply to operate in Europe under new legislation known as the European Market Infrastructure Regulation, or EMIR.    Through our clearing operations in the financial markets, which include the resale and repurchase market, the commodities markets, and the seafood market, NASDAQ OMX Nordic Clearing is the legal counterparty for, and guarantees the fulfillment of, each contract cleared. These contracts are not used by NASDAQ OMX Nordic Clearing for the purpose of trading on its own behalf. As the legal counterparty of each transaction, NASDAQ OMX Nordic Clearing bears the counterparty risk between the purchaser and seller in the contract. In its guarantor role, NASDAQ OMX Nordic Clearing has precisely equal and offsetting claims to and from clearing members on opposite sides of each contract, standing as an intermediary on every contract cleared. In accordance with the rules and regulations of NASDAQ OMX Nordic Clearing, clearing members’ open positions are aggregated to create a single portfolio for which default fund and margin collateral requirements are calculated. See “Default Fund Contributions” and “Margin Deposits” below for further discussion of NASDAQ OMX Nordic Clearing’s default fund and margin requirements.    NASDAQ OMX Nordic Clearing maintains four member sponsored default funds: one related to financial markets, one related to commodities markets, one related to the seafood market, and a mutualized fund. Under this structure, NASDAQ OMX Nordic Clearing and its clearing members must contribute to the total regulatory capital related to the clearing operations of NASDAQ OMX Nordic Clearing. This structure applies an initial separation of default fund contributions for the financial, commodities and seafood markets in order to create a buffer for each market’s counterparty risks. Simultaneously, a mutualized default fund provides capital efficiencies to NASDAQ OMX Nordic Clearing with regard to total regulatory capital required. See “Default Fund Contributions” below for further discussion of NASDAQ OMX Nordic Clearing’s default fund. Power of assessment and a liability waterfall have also been implemented. See “Power of Assessment” and “Liability Waterfall” below for further discussion. These requirements ensure the alignment of risk between NASDAQ OMX Nordic Clearing and its clearing members.    Default Fund Contributions and Margin Deposits    As of June 30, 2014, clearing member default fund contributions and margin deposits were as follows:                                                                                                         June 30, 2014               Cash Contributions(1)(2)        Non-Cash Contributions        Total Contributions                                                          (in millions)      Default fund contributions        $  318 				       $  72 				       $  390 				     Margin deposits          2,261 				         7,052 				         9,313 				     Total        $  2,579 				       $  7,124 				       $  9,703 				        (1)As of June 30, 2014, in accordance with its investment policy, NASDAQ OMX Nordic Clearing has invested cash contributions of $1,692 million in reverse repurchase agreements and $792 million in highly rated government debt securities and time deposits. The remainder of this balance is held in cash.   (2)Pursuant to clearing member agreements, we pay interest on cash contributions to clearing members.    Default Fund Contributions    Contributions made to the default funds are proportional to the exposures of each clearing member. When a clearing member is active in more than one market, contributions must be made to all markets’ default funds in which the member is active. Clearing members’ eligible contributions may include cash and non-cash contributions. Cash contributions received are invested by NASDAQ OMX Nordic Clearing, in accordance with its investment policy, either in highly rated government debt securities or reverse repurchase agreements with highly rated government debt securities as collateral. Clearing members’ cash contributions are included in default funds and margin deposits in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as both a current asset and a current liability. Non-cash contributions include highly rated government debt securities that must meet specific criteria approved by NASDAQ OMX Nordic Clearing. Non-cash contributions are pledged assets that are not recorded in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as NASDAQ OMX Nordic Clearing does not take legal ownership of these assets and the risks and rewards remain with the clearing members. These balances may fluctuate over time due to changes in the amount of deposits required and whether members choose to provide cash or non-cash contributions. Assets pledged are held at a nominee account in NASDAQ OMX Nordic Clearing’s name for the benefit of the clearing members and are immediately accessible by NASDAQ OMX Nordic Clearing in the event of a default. In      22     Table Of Contents   addition to clearing members’ required contributions to the default funds, NASDAQ OMX Nordic Clearing is also required to contribute capital to the default funds and overall regulatory capital as specified under its clearinghouse rules. As of June 30, 2014, NASDAQ OMX Nordic Clearing committed capital totaling $123 million to the member sponsored default funds and overall regulatory capital, in the form of government debt securities, which are recorded as financial investments, at fair value in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The combined regulatory capital of the clearing members and NASDAQ OMX Nordic Clearing will serve to secure the obligations of a clearing member and may be used to cover losses sustained by a clearing member in the event of a default.    Other Capital Contributions by NASDAQ OMX Nordic Clearing    NASDAQ OMX Nordic Clearing maintains a $90 million credit facility which may be utilized in certain default situations, none of which was utilized as of June 30, 2014.    Margin Deposits    NASDAQ OMX Nordic Clearing requires all clearing members to provide collateral, which may consist of cash and non-cash contributions, to guarantee performance on the clearing members’ open positions, or initial margin. In addition, clearing members must also provide collateral to cover the daily margin call as needed, which is in addition to the initial margin. See “Default Fund Contributions” above for further discussion of cash and non-cash contributions.    NASDAQ OMX Nordic Clearing maintains and manages all cash deposits related to margin collateral. All risks and rewards of collateral ownership, including interest, belong to NASDAQ OMX Nordic Clearing. These cash deposits are recorded in default funds and margin deposits in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as both a current asset and current liability. Pledged margin collateral is not recorded in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as all risks and rewards of collateral ownership, including interest, belong to the counterparty. Assets pledged are held at a nominee account in NASDAQ OMX Nordic Clearing’s name for the benefit of the clearing members and are immediately accessible by NASDAQ OMX Nordic Clearing in the event of a default.    NASDAQ OMX Nordic Clearing marks to market all outstanding contracts and requires payment from clearing members whose positions have lost value. The mark-to-market process helps identify any clearing members that may not be able to satisfy their financial obligations in a timely manner allowing NASDAQ OMX Nordic Clearing the ability to mitigate the risk of a clearing member defaulting due to exceptionally large losses. In the event of a default, NASDAQ OMX Nordic Clearing can access the defaulting member’s margin deposits to cover the defaulting member’s losses.    Regulatory Capital and Risk Management Calculations    NASDAQ OMX Nordic Clearing manages risk through a comprehensive counterparty risk management framework, which is comprised of policies, procedures, standards and resources. The level of regulatory capital is determined in accordance with NASDAQ OMX Nordic Clearing’s regulatory capital policy, as approved by the SFSA. Regulatory capital calculations are continuously updated through a proprietary capital-at-risk calculation model that establishes the appropriate level of capital.    As mentioned above, NASDAQ OMX Nordic Clearing is the legal counterparty for each contract traded and thereby guarantees the fulfillment of each contract. NASDAQ OMX Nordic Clearing accounts for this guarantee as a performance guarantee. We determine the fair value of the performance guarantee by considering daily settlement of contracts and other margining and default fund requirements, the risk management program, historical evidence of default payments, and the estimated probability of potential default payouts. The calculation is determined using proprietary risk management software that simulates gains and losses based on historical market prices, extreme but plausible market scenarios, volatility and other factors present at that point in time for those particular unsettled contracts. Based on this analysis, the estimated liability was nominal and no liability was recorded as of June 30, 2014.    The market value of derivative contracts outstanding prior to netting was as follows:                                                              June 30, 2014               (in millions)      Commodity options, futures and forwards(1)(2)(3)        $  1,550 				     Fixed-income options and futures(2)(3)          574 				     Stock options and futures(2)(3)          136 				     Index options and futures(2)(3)          215 				     Seafood options and futures(2)(3)          42 				     Total        $  2,517 				        (1)We determined the fair value of our forward contracts using standard valuation models that were based on market-based observable inputs including LIBOR rates and the spot price of the underlying instrument.    (2)We determined the fair value of our option contracts using standard valuation models that were based on market-based observable inputs including implied volatility, interest rates and the spot price of the underlying instrument.        23     Table Of Contents   (3)We determined the fair value of our futures contracts based upon quoted market prices and average quoted market yields.    The total number of derivative contracts cleared through NASDAQ OMX Nordic Clearing for the six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013 was as follows:                                                                                      June 30, 2014        June 30, 2013      Commodity options, futures and forwards(1)          984,177 				         1,669,004 				     Fixed-income options and futures          10,681,467 				         15,973,955 				     Stock options and futures          17,262,098 				         15,693,325 				     Index options and futures          19,668,100 				         20,967,610 				     Seafood options and futures          42,468 				         1,000 				     Total          48,638,310 				         54,304,894 				        (1)The total volume in cleared power related to commodity contracts was 774 Terawatt hours (TWh) for the six months ended June 30, 2014 and 884 TWh for the six months ended June 30, 2013.    The outstanding contract value of resale and repurchase agreements was $4.8 billion as of June 30, 2014 and $4.3 billion as of June 30, 2013. The total number of contracts cleared was 2,275,565 for the six months ended June 30, 2014 and was 2,264,096 for the six months ended June 30, 2013.    Power of Assessment    To further strengthen the contingent financial resources of the clearinghouse, NASDAQ OMX Nordic Clearing has power of assessment that provides the ability to collect additional funds from its clearing members to cover a defaulting member’s remaining obligations up to the limits established under the terms of the clearinghouse rules. The power of assessment corresponds to 100% of the clearing member’s aggregate contribution to the financial, commodities, and the seafood market’s default funds.    Liability Waterfall    The liability waterfall is the priority order in which the capital resources would be utilized in the event of a default where the defaulting clearing member’s collateral would not be sufficient to cover the cost to settle its portfolio. If a default occurs and the defaulting clearing member’s collateral, including cash deposits and pledged assets, is depleted, then capital is utilized in the following amount and order:    •junior capital contributed to each specific market by NASDAQ OMX Nordic Clearing, which totaled $22 million at June 30, 2014;    •a loss sharing pool related only to the financial market that is contributed to by clearing members and only applies if the defaulting member’s portfolio includes interest rate swap products;   •specific market default fund where the loss occurred, either the financial, commodities, or seafood market, which includes capital contributions of both the clearing members and NASDAQ OMX Nordic Clearing on a pro-rata basis;    •senior capital contributed to each specific market by NASDAQ OMX Nordic Clearing, calculated in accordance with clearinghouse rules to be $15 million at June 30, 2014; and    •mutualized default fund, which includes capital contributions of both the clearing members and NASDAQ OMX Nordic Clearing on a pro-rata basis.    If additional funds are needed after utilization of the mutualized default fund, then NASDAQ OMX Nordic Clearing will utilize its power of assessment and additional capital contributions will be required by non-defaulting members up to the limits established under the terms of the clearinghouse rules.    15. Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees    Guarantees Issued and Credit Facilities Available    In addition to the default fund contributions and margin collateral pledged by clearing members discussed in Note 14, “Clearing Operations,” we have obtained financial guarantees and credit facilities which are guaranteed by us through counter indemnities, to provide further liquidity and default protection related to our clearing businesses. Financial guarantees issued to us totaled $28 million at June 30, 2014 and $20 million at December 31, 2013. At June 30, 2014, credit facilities, which are available in multiple currencies, primarily Swedish Krona, totaled $317 million ($227 million in available liquidity and $90 million for default protection), none of which was utilized. At December 31, 2013, these facilities totaled $312 million ($219 million in available liquidity and $93 million for default protection), of which $11 million was utilized.   Execution Access LLC is an introducing broker which operates the eSpeed trading platform for U.S. Treasury securities. Execution Access has a clearing arrangement with Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., or Cantor Fitzgerald. As of June 30, 2014, we      24     Table Of Contents   have contributed $19 million of clearing deposits to Cantor Fitzgerald in connection with this clearing arrangement. These deposits are recorded in other current assets in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Some of the trading activity in Execution Access is cleared by Cantor Fitzgerald through the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation, or FICC, and the balance is cleared non-FICC. Execution Access assumes the counterparty risk of clients that do not clear through FICC. Counterparty risk of clients exists for Execution Access between the trade date and the settlement date of the individual transactions, which is one business day. All of Execution Access’ obligations under the clearing arrangement with Cantor Fitzgerald are guaranteed by NASDAQ OMX. Some of the non-FICC counterparties are required to post collateral, provide principal letters, or provide other forms of credit enhancement to Execution Access for the purpose of mitigating counterparty risk.    We believe that the potential for us to be required to make payments under these arrangements is mitigated through the pledged collateral and our risk management policies. Accordingly, no contingent liability is recorded in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets for these arrangements.    Lease Commitments    We lease some of our office space and equipment under non-cancelable operating leases with third parties and sublease office space to third parties. Some of our lease agreements contain renewal options and escalation clauses based on increases in property taxes and building operating costs.    Other Guarantees    We have provided other guarantees of $15 million as of June 30, 2014 and $17 million at December 31, 2013. These guarantees are primarily related to obligations for our rental and leasing contracts as well as performance guarantees on certain Market Technology contracts related to the delivery of software technology and support services. We have received financial guarantees from various financial institutions to support the above guarantees.    We believe that the potential for us to be required to make payments under these arrangements is unlikely. Accordingly, no contingent liability is recorded in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets for the above guarantees.   In connection with the launch of NASDAQ OMX NLX, we have entered into agreements with certain members which may require us to make payments if certain financial goals are achieved. Since the amount of these payments is not currently probable and cannot be quantified as of June 30, 2014, no contingent liability is recorded in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets for these payments.   Contingent Consideration     In March 2014, we completed the acquisition of the remaining 28% ownership interest in BWise. The purchase included two installment payments, the first of which was made in March 2014. The second installment payment is expected to be paid in 2015.   As part of the eSpeed purchase price consideration, we have agreed to future annual issuances of 992,247 shares of NASDAQ OMX common stock which approximated certain tax benefits associated with the transaction. Such contingent future issuances of NASDAQ OMX common stock will be paid ratably through 2027 if NASDAQ OMX’s total gross revenues equal or exceed $25 million in each such year. The contingent future issuances of NASDAQ OMX common stock are subject to anti-dilution protections and acceleration upon certain events.   Escrow Agreements    In connection with our acquisitions of FTEN and Glide Technologies, we entered into escrow agreements to secure the payments of post-closing adjustments and to ensure other closing conditions. At June 30, 2014, these escrow agreements provide for future payments of $10 million and are included in other current liabilities and other non-current liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.    Routing Brokerage Activities    Our broker-dealer subsidiaries, Nasdaq Execution Services, LLC and NASDAQ Options Services, LLC, provide guarantees to securities clearinghouses and exchanges under their standard membership agreements, which require members to guarantee the performance of other members. If a member becomes unable to satisfy its obligations to a clearinghouse or exchange, other members would be required to meet its shortfalls. To mitigate these performance risks, the exchanges and clearinghouses often require members to post collateral, as well as meet certain minimum financial standards. Nasdaq Execution Services’ and NASDAQ Options Services’ maximum potential liability under these arrangements cannot be quantified. However, we believe that the potential for Nasdaq Execution Services and NASDAQ Options Services to be required to make payments under these arrangements is unlikely. Accordingly, no contingent liability is recorded in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets for these arrangements.   Litigation        25     Table Of Contents   As previously disclosed, we became a party to several legal and regulatory proceedings in 2012, 2013, and 2014 relating to the Facebook IPO that occurred on May 18, 2012. We believe that the legal actions filed against NASDAQ OMX are without merit and intend to defend them vigorously.    As described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012, we are named as a defendant in a consolidated matter captioned In re Facebook, Inc., IPO Securities and Derivative Litigation, MDL No. 2389 (S.D.N.Y.). Our appeal of the district court’s order granting in part and denying in part our motion to dismiss the consolidated amended complaint is currently pending in the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, at No. 14-1457.    In our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2013, we identified a demand for arbitration from a member organization seeking indemnification for alleged losses associated with the Facebook IPO. On June 18, 2013, the District Court for the Southern District of New York granted a preliminary injunction enjoining the arbitration, and the member organization has appealed the order granting the injunction to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals.    We also are named as one of many defendants in City of Providence v. BATS Global Markets, Inc., et al., 14 Civ. 2811 (S.D.N.Y.), which was filed on April 18, 2014 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The plaintiff has named as defendants sixteen national exchanges; fourteen of the largest brokerage firms in the United States; and twelve financial-services firms whose primary business allegedly is engaging in high-frequency trading. On behalf of a putative class of securities traders, the plaintiff alleges that the defendants engaged in a scheme to manipulate the markets through high-frequency trading; the complaint asserts claims against us under Section 10(b) of the Act and Rule 10b-5, as well as under Section 6(b) of the Act. The district court has appointed lead counsel, who have until September 2, 2014 either to file an amended complaint or to proceed with the initial complaint. Given the preliminary nature of the proceedings, we are unable to estimate what, if any, liability may result from this litigation. However, we believe the claims to be without merit and intend to litigate them vigorously.    In addition, we are named as one of many exchange defendants in Lanier v. BATS Exchange Inc., et al., 14 Civ. 3745 (S.D.N.Y.), Lanier v. BATS Exchange Inc., et al., 14 Civ. 3865 (S.D.N.Y.), and Lanier v. Bats Exchange Inc., 14 Civ. 3866 (S.D.N.Y.), which were filed between May 23, 2014 and May 30, 2014 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The plaintiff is the same in each of these cases, and the three complaints contain substantially similar allegations. On behalf of a putative class of subscribers for market data provided by national exchanges, the plaintiff alleges that the exchanges provided data more quickly to certain market participants than to others, supposedly in breach of the exchanges’ plans for dissemination of market data and subscriber agreements executed under those plans. The complaint asserts contractual theories under state law based on these alleged breaches. Given the preliminary nature of the proceedings, we are unable to estimate what, if any, liability may result from this litigation. However, we believe the claims to be without merit and intend to litigate them vigorously.    Except as disclosed above and in prior reports filed under the Act, we are not currently a party to any litigation or proceeding that we believe could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition, or operating results. However, from time to time, we have been threatened with, or named as a defendant in, lawsuits or involved in regulatory proceedings.    Tax Audits    We are engaged in ongoing discussions and audits with taxing authorities on various tax matters, the resolutions of which are uncertain. Currently, there are matters that may lead to assessments, some of which may not be resolved for several years. Based on currently available information, we believe we have adequately provided for any assessments that could result from those proceedings where it is more likely than not that we will be assessed. We review our positions on these matters as they progress.           16.

The platforms allow the routing and execution of buy and sell orders as well as the reporting of transactions for cash equity securities, derivatives and ETFs, providing fee-based revenues. In addition, eSpeed’s electronic benchmark U.S. treasury brokerage and co-location service businesses are part of our Market Services segment.        26     Table Of Contents   Listing Services    Our Listing Services segment includes our U.S. and European Listing Services businesses.

We help organizations manage the two-way flow of information with their audiences through our suite of advanced technology, analytics, and consultative services. In May 2013, we acquired the TR Corporate Solutions businesses which were integrated into our Corporate Solutions business. With the acquisition of the TR Corporate Solutions businesses, Corporate Solutions revenues primarily include product revenues from the following key areas: governance, investor relations, multimedia solutions, and public relations.    Our Market Technology business is a leading global technology solutions provider and partner to exchanges, clearing organizations and central securities depositories. Our technology business is also the sales channel for our complete global offering to other marketplaces.    Market Technology provides technology solutions for trading, clearing, settlement, surveillance and information dissemination to markets with wide-ranging requirements, from the leading markets in the U.S., Europe and Asia to smaller African markets. Our solutions can handle a wide array of assets including cash equities, currencies, various interest-bearing securities, commodities, energy products and derivatives. Market Technology also provides broker services and enterprise governance, risk management and compliance software and services.    Our management allocates resources, assesses performance and manages these businesses as four separate segments. We evaluate the performance of our segments based on several factors, of which the primary financial measure is operating income. Results of individual businesses are presented based on our management accounting practices and our management structure. Certain amounts are allocated to corporate items in our management reports based on the decision that those activities should not be used to evaluate the segment’s operating performance. See below for further discussion.    The following table presents certain information regarding these operating segments for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.    The following discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of NASDAQ OMX should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this Form 10-Q.    Business Overview    We are a leading global exchange group that delivers trading, clearing, exchange technology, regulatory, securities listing, and public company services across six continents. Our global offerings are diverse and include trading and clearing across multiple asset classes, access services, market data products, financial indexes, capital formation solutions, financial services, corporate solutions and market technology products and services. Our technology powers markets across the globe, supporting derivatives trading, clearing and settlement, cash equity trading, fixed income trading and many other functions.    In the U.S., we operate The NASDAQ Stock Market, a registered national securities exchange. The NASDAQ Stock Market is the largest single cash equities securities market in the U.S. in terms of listed companies and in the world in terms of share value traded. As of June 30, 2014, The NASDAQ Stock Market was home to 2,709 listed companies with a combined market capitalization of approximately $7.6 trillion. In addition, in the U.S. we operate two additional cash equities trading markets, three options markets and an electronic platform for trading of U.S. Treasuries. In March 2014, we launched NPM, a marketplace for private growth companies.   In Europe, we operate exchanges in Stockholm (Sweden), Copenhagen (Denmark), Helsinki (Finland), and Iceland, as well as the clearing operations of NASDAQ OMX Clearing AB as NASDAQ OMX Nordic. We also operate exchanges in Tallinn (Estonia), Riga (Latvia) and Vilnius (Lithuania) as NASDAQ OMX Baltic. Collectively, NASDAQ OMX Nordic and NASDAQ OMX Baltic offer trading in cash equities, bonds, structured products and ETFs, as well as trading and clearing of derivatives and clearing of resale and repurchase agreements.

As of June 30, 2014, the exchanges that comprise NASDAQ OMX Nordic and NASDAQ OMX Baltic, together with NASDAQ OMX First North, were home to 782 listed companies with a combined market capitalization of approximately $1.3 trillion. We also operate NASDAQ OMX Armenia.    In addition, NASDAQ OMX Commodities operates a power derivatives exchange regulated in Norway and a European carbon exchange. In the U.K., we operate NASDAQ OMX NLX, a London-based market for trading of listed short-term and long-term European (Euro and Sterling denominated) interest rate derivative products.   In some of the countries where we operate exchanges, we also provide investment firm, clearing, settlement and central depository services.   Business Segments    We manage, operate and provide our products and services in four business segments: Market Services, Listing Services, Information Services and Technology Solutions.    Our reportable segments are as follows.   Market Services    Our Market Services segment includes our derivative trading and clearing, cash equity trading, fixed income trading, and access and broker services businesses. We offer trading on multiple exchanges and facilities across several asset classes, including derivatives, commodities, cash equity, debt, structured products and ETFs.

The platforms allow the routing and execution of buy and sell orders as well as the reporting of transactions for cash equity securities, derivatives and ETFs, providing fee based revenues. In addition, eSpeed’s electronic benchmark U.S. Treasury brokerage and co-location service businesses are part of our Market Services segment.    Listing Services    Our Listing Services segment includes our U.S. and European Listing Services businesses. We offer capital raising solutions to over 3,400 companies around the globe representing approximately $8.9 trillion in total market value as of June 30, 2014.    We operate a variety of listing platforms around the world to provide multiple global capital raising solutions for private and public companies. Our main listing markets are The NASDAQ Stock Market and the exchanges that comprise NASDAQ OMX Nordic and NASDAQ OMX Baltic. In March 2014, we launched NPM, a marketplace for private growth companies.         29     Table Of Contents   Information Services   Our Information Services segment includes our Market Data Products and our Index Licensing and Services businesses.    Our Market Data Products business sells and distributes historical and real-time quote and trade information to market participants and data distributors. Our market data products enhance transparency and provide critical information to financial professional and individual investors globally. In addition, eSpeed’s market data business is part of our Information Services segment.    Our Index Licensing and Services business develops and licenses NASDAQ OMX branded indexes, associated derivatives, and financial products and also provides custom calculation services for third-party clients.    Technology Solutions    Our Technology Solutions segment includes our Corporate Solutions and Market Technology businesses.    Our Corporate Solutions business serves corporate clients, including companies listed on our exchanges. We help organizations manage the two-way flow of information with their audiences through our suite of advanced technology, analytics, and consultative services. In May 2013, we acquired the TR Corporate Solutions businesses which were integrated into our Corporate Solutions business. With the acquisition of the TR Corporate Solutions businesses, Corporate Solutions revenues primarily include product revenues from the following key areas: governance, investor relations, multimedia solutions and public relations.

Market Technology also provides broker services and enterprise governance, risk management and compliance software solutions.   Our management allocates resources, assesses performance and manages these businesses as four separate segments. See Note 16, “Business Segments,” to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion.    Business Environment    We serve listed companies, market participants and investors by providing derivative, commodities, cash equity, and fixed income markets, thereby facilitating economic growth and corporate entrepreneurship. We provide market technology to exchanges, clearing organizations and central securities depositories around the world. We also offer companies and other organizations access to innovative products and software solutions and services that increase transparency, mitigate risk, improve board efficiency and facilitate better corporate governance. In broad terms, our business performance is impacted by a number of drivers, including macroeconomic events affecting the risk and return of financial assets, investor sentiment, government and private sector demands for capital, the regulatory environment for capital markets, and changing technology particularly in the financial services industry. Our future revenues and net income will continue to be influenced by a number of domestic and international economic trends including:    •Trading volumes in U.S. and European derivative, fixed income, and cash equity securities, which are driven primarily by overall macroeconomic conditions;    •The number of companies seeking equity financing, which is affected by factors such as investor demand, the global economy, availability of diverse sources of financing as well as tax and regulatory policies;    •The demand for information about, or access to, our markets, which is dependent on the products we trade, our importance as a liquidity center, and the quality and pricing of our data and access services;    •The demand by companies and other organizations for the products sold by our Corporate Solutions business, which is largely driven by the overall state of the economy and the attractiveness of our offerings;    •The demand for licensed exchange traded products and other financial products based on our indices as well as changes to the underlying assets associated with existing licensed financial products;   •The challenges created by the automation of market data consumption, including competition and the quickly evolving nature of the market data business;    •The outlook of our technology customers for capital market activity;    •Continuing pressure in transaction fee pricing due to intense competition in the U.S. and Europe;    •Competition for listings and trading related to pricing, product features and service offerings;    •Regulatory changes relating to market structure or imposed upon certain types of instruments, transactions, pricing structures or capital market participants; and        30     Table Of Contents   •Technological advancements and members’ demand for speed, efficiency, and reliability.    Currently our business drivers are defined by investors’ and companies’ cautiously optimistic outlook about the pace of the global economic recovery. Although some major market indices reached record levels in the second quarter of 2014, European equity markets have not performed as well and remain below their pre-financial crisis highs. As the global economy continues to avoid the intermittent crisis environments of 2010 through 2012, we are experiencing modest growth in many of our non-transactional businesses. Since a number of significant structural issues continue to confront the global economy, instability could return at any time, resulting in an increased level of market volatility, oscillating trading volumes, and a return of market uncertainty. Positive momentum in the IPO market has carried over from 2013. Steady performances by major U.S. stock market indices and consistently low volatility in the second quarter of 2014 helped to boost the U.S. IPO market to record post-crisis levels. In the second quarter of 2014, the U.S. cash equity trading business experienced a decrease in volumes due to lower overall industry trading volumes, while the European cash equity trading business saw a slight increase in volume. Both the U.S. and European derivative trading and clearing business experienced a decline in volume. Additional impacts on our business drivers included the international enactment and implementation of new legislative and regulatory initiatives, the adapting business models of our largest transactional business customers as they address the regulatory changes initiated following the global financial crisis and the evolution of market participant trading behavior, and the continued rapid progression and deployment of new technology in the financial services industry. The business environment that influenced our financial performance for the second quarter of 2014 may be characterized as follows:    •A much stronger pace of new equity issuance in the U.S. with 52 IPOs on The NASDAQ Stock Market, up from 35 in the second quarter of 2013. IPO activity improved in the Nordics with 17 IPOs in the second quarter of 2014 on the exchanges that comprise NASDAQ OMX Nordic and NASDAQ OMX Baltic, up from 6 IPOs in the second quarter of 2013;    •Average daily matched equity options volume for our three U.S. options exchanges decreased 13.4% compared to the second quarter of 2013, and overall average daily U.S. options volume decreased 10.4%. The decrease in our average daily matched options volume was driven by a drop in U.S. consolidated options volume as well as a decline of 0.9 percentage points in our combined matched market share for our three U.S. options exchanges;    •Average daily matched share volume for all of our U.S. cash equity markets decreased by 3.1% and average daily U.S. share volume fell by 8.3% relative to the second quarter of 2013. Volatility, often a driver of volume levels, was lower in the second quarter of 2014 compared with the same period in 2013. Losses in matched share volume were due to lower U.S. consolidated volume and were partially offset by an increase in matched market share from 19.1% in the second quarter of 2013 (NASDAQ 15.9%; NASDAQ OMX BX 2.4%; NASDAQ OMX PSX 0.8%) to 20.2% in the second quarter of 2014 (NASDAQ 17.1%; NASDAQ OMX BX 2.6%; NASDAQ OMX PSX 0.5%);   •Continuous cost focus in the industry has further increased the growth of our NASDAQ Basic product. The number of NASDAQ Basic subscribers increased 201% compared to the second quarter of 2013;    •A 0.8% increase relative to the second quarter of 2013 in the average daily number of cash equity trades on our Nordic and Baltic exchanges;   •A 17.5% increase relative to the second quarter of 2013 in the SEK value of cash equity transactions on our Nordic and Baltic exchanges;    •A decline of 10.3% experienced by our Nordic and Baltic exchanges relative to the second quarter of 2013 in the number of traded and cleared options, futures and fixed-income contracts (excluding Finnish option contracts traded on Eurex);    •Intense competition among U.S. exchanges and dealer-owned systems for cash equity trading volume and strong competition between multilateral trading facilities and exchanges in Europe for cash equity trading volume;    •Globalization of exchanges, customers and competitors extending the competitive horizon beyond national markets; and    •Market trends requiring continued investment in technology to meet customers’ and regulators’ demands as markets adapt to a global financial industry, as increasing numbers of new companies are created, and as emerging countries show ongoing interest in developing their financial markets.               31     Table Of Contents   Financial Summary    The following table summarizes our financial performance for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014 when compared with the same periods in 2013. The comparability of our results of operations between reported periods is impacted by the acquisitions of eSpeed on June 28, 2013 and the TR Corporate Solutions businesses on May 31, 2013.

In countries with currencies other than the U.S. dollar, revenues and expenses are translated using monthly average exchange rates. The following discussion of results of operations isolates the impact of year-over-year foreign currency fluctuations to better measure the comparability of operating results between periods. Operating results excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations are calculated by translating the current period’s results by the prior period’s exchange rates.    Impacts associated with fluctuations in foreign currency are discussed in more detail under “Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.” For the three months ended June 30, 2014, approximately 33.6% of our revenues less transaction rebates, brokerage, clearance and exchange fees and 21.4% of our operating income were derived from currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the Swedish Krona, Euro, Norwegian Krone, Danish Krone and British Pound. For the six months ended June 30, 2014, approximately 34.0% of our revenues less transaction rebates, brokerage, clearance and exchange fees and 24.1% of our operating income were derived from currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the Swedish Krona, Euro, Norwegian Krone, Danish Krone and British Pound.   The following summarizes significant changes in our financial performance for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014 when compared with the same periods in 2013:    •Revenues less transaction rebates, brokerage, clearance and exchange fees increased $72 million, or 16.0%, to $523 million in the second quarter of 2014, compared with $451 million in the same period in 2013, reflecting an operational increase in revenues. The increase in operational revenues was primarily due to an:    •increase in Corporate Solutions revenues of $35 million, reflecting higher revenues resulting from the acquisition of the TR Corporate Solutions businesses in May 2013;    •increase in fixed income trading revenues less brokerage, clearance and exchange fees of $14 million, reflecting the acquisition of eSpeed;    •increase in Market Data Products revenues of $12 million, primarily from U.S. market data products;   •increase in Market Technology revenues of $7 million;   •increase in cash equity trading revenues less transaction rebates, brokerage, clearance and exchange fees of $6 million; and    •increase in Index Licensing and Services revenues of $4 million, partially offset by;   •a decrease in derivative trading and clearing revenues less transaction rebates, brokerage, clearance and exchange fees of $10 million.    •Revenues less transaction rebates, brokerage, clearance and exchange fees increased $183 million, or 21.1%, to $1,052 million in the first six months of 2014, compared with $869 million in the same period in 2013, reflecting an operational increase in revenues. The increase in operational revenues was primarily due to an:    •increase in Corporate Solutions revenues of $91 million, reflecting higher revenues resulting from the acquisition of the TR Corporate Solutions businesses in May 2013;    •increase in fixed income trading revenues less brokerage, clearance and exchange fees of $28 million, reflecting the acquisition of eSpeed;        32     Table Of Contents   •increase in Market Data Products revenues of $23 million, primarily from U.S. market data products;    •increase in cash equity trading revenues less transaction rebates, brokerage, clearance and exchange fees of $19 million;      •increase in Index Licensing and Services revenues of $10 million, and   •increase in Market Technology revenues of $10 million, partially offset by;   •a decrease in derivative trading and clearing revenues less transaction rebates, brokerage, clearance and exchange fees of $5 million.    •Operating expenses increased $40 million, or 13.7%, to $332 million in the second quarter of 2014, compared with $292 million in the same period of 2013, reflecting an increase in operating expenses of $38 million and an unfavorable impact from foreign exchange of $2 million. The increase in operational expenses was primarily due to additional overall expense associated with our acquisitions of the TR Corporate Solutions businesses in May 2013 and eSpeed in June 2013 and a loss on extinguishment of debt, partially offset by a decrease in merger and strategic initiatives expense.    •Operating expenses increased $57 million, or 9.2%, to $677 million in the first six months of 2014, compared with $620 million in the same period of 2013, reflecting an increase in operating expenses of $54 million and an unfavorable impact from foreign exchange of $3 million. The increase in operational expenses was primarily due to additional overall expense associated with our acquisitions of the TR Corporate Solutions businesses in May 2013 and eSpeed in June 2013, a loss on extinguishment of debt, and higher merger and strategic initiatives expense, partially offset by a decrease in expense related to our voluntary accommodation program and a decrease in restructuring charges.   •Interest expense increased $4 million, or 15.4%, to $30 million in the second quarter of 2014, compared with $26 million in the same period in 2013, and increased $9 million, or 18%, to $59 million in the first six months of 2014, compared with $50 million in the same period in 2013, primarily due to the issuance of our 2021 Notes in June 2013 and the issuance of our 2024 Notes in June 2014, partially offset by lower outstanding balances on our 2011 Credit Facility and the repayment of our 2.50% convertible senior notes in August 2013. See Note 8, “Debt Obligations,” to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion.   •In the first six months of 2013, asset impairment charges of $10 million were related to certain acquired intangible assets associated with customer relationships ($7 million) and a certain trade name ($3 million).    •Income tax provision was $61 million in the second quarter of 2014 compared with $47 million in the same period in 2013, an increase of $14 million. The income tax provision was $114 million in the first six months of 2014 compared with $64 million in the same period in 2013, an increase of $50 million. The increase in both periods was primarily due to the increase in income before income taxes and a change in the geographic mix of earnings and losses. In addition, in the second quarter of 2014, we recorded adjustments related to our 2010 through 2012 tax return liabilities which resulted in an increase to the tax provision.   These current and prior year items are discussed in more detail below.                                                                                                            33     Table Of Contents   NASDAQ OMX’s Operating Results    Key Drivers    The following table includes key drivers for our Market Services, Listing Services, and Technology Solutions segments.

(2) Includes Section 31 fees of $75 million in the second quarter of 2014, $69 million in the second quarter of 2013, $144 million in the first six months of 2014 and $133 million in the first six months of 2013. Section 31 fees are recorded as U.S. cash equity trading revenues with a corresponding amount recorded in cost of revenues.       37     Table Of Contents       Market Services revenues less transaction rebates, brokerage, clearance and exchange fees increased in the second quarter and first six months of 2014 compared with the same periods in 2013 primarily due to increases in both fixed income trading revenues less brokerage, clearance and exchange fees and cash equity trading revenues less transaction rebates, brokerage, clearance and exchange fees, partially offset by a decline in derivative trading and clearing revenues less transaction rebates, brokerage, clearance and exchange fees.    U.S. Derivative Trading and Clearing Revenues    U.S. derivative trading and clearing revenues decreased in the second quarter and increased in the first six months of 2014 compared with the same periods in 2013. The decrease in U.S. derivative trading and clearing revenues in the second quarter of 2014 was primarily due to a decline in industry trading volumes and an overall decrease in market share between our three U.S. options exchanges, partially offset by an increase in revenue capture. The increase in U.S. derivative trading and clearing revenues in the first six months of 2014 was primarily due to an increase in revenue capture, partially offset by an overall decrease in market share at our three U.S. options exchanges, a decline in industry trading volumes and a decrease in Section 31 pass-through fee revenue.   U.S. derivative trading and clearing revenues less transaction rebates, brokerage, clearance and exchange fees decreased in both the second quarter and first six months of 2014 compared with the same periods in 2013. The decreases were primarily due to a decline in industry trading volumes and moderate declines in average net capture and overall market share at our three U.S. options exchanges.   Section 31 fees are recorded as derivative trading and clearing revenues with a corresponding amount recorded as cost of revenues. We are assessed these fees from the SEC and pass them through to our customers in the form of incremental fees. Pass-through fees can increase or decrease due to rate changes by the SEC, our percentage of the overall industry volumes processed on our systems, and differences in actual dollar value of shares traded. Since the amount recorded in revenues is equal to the amount recorded in cost of revenues, there is no impact on our revenues less transaction rebates, brokerage, clearance and exchange fees. Section 31 fees were $7 million in both the second quarter of 2014 and 2013, $13 million in the first six months of 2014 and $16 million in the first six months of 2013.    Transaction rebates, in which we credit a portion of the per share execution charge to the market participant, increased in the second quarter and first six months of 2014 compared with the same periods in 2013 primarily due to an increase in overall rebate capture rates, partially offset by lower industry trading volumes and a decrease in overall market share at our three U.S. options exchanges.   Brokerage, clearance and exchange fees decreased in the second quarter and first six months of 2014 compared with the same periods in 2013 primarily due to a decrease in routing costs. Additionally, Section 31 pass-through fees were lower in the first six months of 2014 compared with the same period in 2013, which also contributed to the decline in brokerage, clearance and exchange fees during this period.    European Derivative Trading and Clearing Revenues    The following table shows revenues from European derivative trading and clearing:                                                                                                                                                                                      Three Months Ended June 30,        Percentage        Six Months Ended June 30,        Percentage               2014        2013        Change        2014        2013        Change               (in millions)                    (in millions)                  European Derivative Trading and Clearing Revenues:                                                                              Options and futures contracts        $  11 				       $  11 				           -        $  22 				       $  22 				           -      Energy, carbon and other commodity products          12 				         12 				           -          27 				         25 				         8.0% 				     Fixed-income products          2 				         4 				           (50.0)%          5 				         9 				           (44.4)%      Other revenues and fees          3 				         1 				           #           6 				         2 				           #       Total European Derivative Trading and Clearing revenues        $  28 				       $  28 				           -        $  60 				       $  58 				         3.4% 				        #Denotes a variance greater than 100.0%.       38     Table Of Contents       European derivative trading and clearing revenues were flat in the second quarter of 2014 compared with the same period in 2013 as the impact of NLX trading incentives resulted in lower revenues from fixed income products, which were offset by higher other revenues and fees due to higher clearing revenues. European derivative trading and clearing revenues increased in the first six months of 2014 compared with the same periods in 2013 primarily due to higher revenues in our energy, carbon and other commodity products primarily due to higher trading activity and an increase in other revenues and fees primarily due to higher clearing revenues, partially offset by lower revenues from fixed-income products primarily due to the impact of NLX trading incentives and an unfavorable impact from foreign exchange of $2 million.        U.S. Cash Equity Trading Revenues    U.S. cash equity trading revenues less transaction rebates, brokerage, clearance and exchange fees increased in the second quarter and first six months of 2014 compared with the same periods in 2013. The increase in the second quarter of 2014 was primarily due to an increase in our overall matched market share and an increase in average net capture, partially offset by lower industry trading volumes. The increase in the first six months of 2014 was primarily due to an increase in our overall matched market share.    U.S. cash equity trading revenues decreased in the second quarter and increased in the first six months of 2014 compared with the same periods in 2013. The decrease in the second quarter was primarily due to lower industry trading volumes and lower revenue capture, partially offset by an increase in our overall matched market share and an increase in Section 31 pass-through fee revenues. The increase in the first six months of 2014 was primarily due to an increase in our overall matched market share and an increase in Section 31 pass-through fee revenues, partially offset by lower revenue capture.     Similar to U.S. derivative trading and clearing, we record Section 31 fees as U.S. cash equity trading revenues with a corresponding amount recorded as cost of revenues. We are assessed these fees from the SEC and pass them through to our customers in the form of incremental fees. Since the amount recorded in revenues is equal to the amount recorded in cost of revenues, there is no impact on our revenues less transaction rebates, brokerage, clearance and exchange fees. Section 31 fees were $75 million in the second quarter of 2014, $69 million in the second quarter of 2013, $144 million in the first six months of 2014 and $133 million in the first six months of 2013. The increase in the second quarter of 2014 was primarily due to higher dollar value traded on the NASDAQ and NASDAQ OMX BX trading systems and higher pass-through fee rates. The increase in the first six months of 2014 was primarily due to higher dollar value traded on the NASDAQ and NASDAQ OMX BX trading systems, partially offset by lower pass-through fee rates.   For NASDAQ and NASDAQ OMX PSX, we credit a portion of the per share execution charge to the market participant that provides the liquidity and for NASDAQ OMX BX, we credit a portion of the per share execution charge to the market participant that takes the liquidity. These transaction rebates decreased in the second quarter and increased in the first six months of 2014 compared with the same periods in 2013. The decrease in the second quarter was primarily due to a decline in industry trading volumes and a decline in rebate capture, partially offset by an increase in our overall matched market share. The increase in the first six months was primarily due to an increase in our overall market share, partially offset by a decline in rebate capture.     Brokerage, clearance and exchange fees increased in the second quarter and first six months of 2014 compared with the same periods in 2013 primarily due to an increase in Section 31 pass-through fees, partially offset by a decline in routing costs due to lower volume routed.    European Cash Equity Trading Revenues    European cash equity trading revenues include trading revenues from equity products traded on the NASDAQ OMX Nordic and NASDAQ OMX Baltic exchanges. European cash equity trading revenues increased in the second quarter and first six months of 2014 compared with the same periods in 2013 primarily due to higher industry volumes, driven by three new large market capitalization listings, and an increase in market share.    Fixed Income Trading Revenues    Fixed income trading revenues less brokerage, clearance and exchange fees includes transaction fees generated from our eSpeed electronic benchmark U.S. Treasury trading platform that was acquired on June 28, 2013.    Access and Broker Services Revenues    Access and Broker Services revenues increased in the second quarter and first six months of 2014 compared with the same periods in 2013 primarily due to increased revenues from the addition of eSpeed hosting revenues. We completed the acquisition of eSpeed on June 28, 2013.           39     Table Of Contents   LISTING SERVICES    The following table shows revenues from our Listing Services segment:                                                                                                                                                                                      Three Months Ended June 30,        Percentage        Six Months Ended June 30,        Percentage               2014        2013        Change        2014        2013        Change                                                                                              (in millions)                    (in millions)                  Listing Services Revenues:                                                                              U.S. listing services        $  45 				       $  44 				         2.3% 				       $  87 				       $  86 				         1.2% 				     European listing services          15 				         14 				         7.1% 				         30 				         27 				         11.1% 				     Total Listing Services revenues        $  60 				       $  58 				         3.4% 				       $  117 				       $  113 				         3.5% 				    Listing Services revenues increased in the second quarter and first six months of 2014 compared with the same periods in 2013 due to an increase in both U.S. listing services and European listing services revenues. The increase in U.S. listing services revenues is primarily due to an increase in annual listing fees, reflecting an increase in the number of listed companies. The number of NASDAQ listed companies was 2,709 as of June 30, 2014 compared with 2,581 as of June 30, 2013. The increase in European listing services revenues was driven by higher market capitalization of listed companies.   U.S. listing services revenues include annual listing fees, listing of additional shares fees and initial listing fees. Listing of additional shares fees and initial listing fees are recognized on a straight line basis over an estimated service period, which are four and six years, respectively, and can vary over time.

U.S. Market Data Products Revenues   U.S. market data products revenues increased in the second quarter and first six months of 2014 compared with the same periods in 2013 primarily due to higher customer demand for proprietary data products, select pricing initiatives, higher audit collections and an increase in revenues due to the acquisition of eSpeed, which was completed on June 28, 2013. An increase in net U.S. tape plan revenues also contributed to the increase in the first six months of 2014 compared with the same period in 2013.    European Market Data Products Revenues   European market data products revenues increased in the second quarter and first six months of 2014 compared with the same periods in 2013 primarily due to an increase in audit collections and pricing changes.   Index Data Products Revenues   Index data products revenues increased in the second quarter and first six months of 2014 compared with the same periods in 2013 primarily due to an increase in audit collections, new subscribers and pricing changes.       Index Licensing and Services Revenues       40     Table Of Contents   Index Licensing and Services revenues increased in the second quarter and first six months of 2014 compared with the same periods in 2013 primarily due to higher assets under management and an increase in the number of licensed exchange traded products.

Technology Solutions revenues increased in the second quarter and first six months of 2014 compared with the same periods in 2013 due to increases in both Corporate Solutions revenues and Market Technology revenues.     Corporate Solutions Revenues   Corporate Solutions revenues increased in the second quarter and first six months of 2014 compared with the same periods in 2013 primarily due to the acquisition of the TR Corporate Solutions businesses completed on May 31, 2013 and expanding customer utilization of GlobeNewswire and Directors Desk products.    Market Technology Revenues   Market Technology revenues increased in the second quarter and first six months of 2014 compared with the same periods in 2013 primarily due to an increase in software, license and support revenues primarily due to an increase in BWise revenues and an increase in software as a service revenues primarily due to an increase in SMARTS broker surveillance revenues.    Total Order Value    As of June 30, 2014, total order value, which represents the total contract value of orders signed that are yet to be recognized as revenues, was $638 million. Market Technology deferred revenue, included in the total Technology Solutions deferred revenue of $234 million, represents consideration received that is yet to be recognized as revenue for these signed orders. See Note 7, “Deferred Revenue,” to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion. The recognition and timing of these revenues depends on many factors, including those that are not within our control. As such, the following table of Market Technology revenues to be recognized in the future represents our best estimate:                                                              Total Order Value                                  (in millions)      Fiscal year ended:                  2014(1)        $  86 				     2015          190 				     2016          128 				     2017          98 				     2018          65 				     2019 and thereafter          71 				     Total        $  638 				        41     Table Of Contents       (1) Represents revenues that are anticipated to be recognized over the remaining six months of 2014.

Total operating expenses increased $40 million in the second quarter of 2014 compared with the same period in 2013, reflecting an increase in operating expenses of $38 million and an unfavorable impact from foreign exchange of $2 million. Total operating expenses increased $57 million in the first six months of 2014 compared with the same period in 2013, reflecting an increase in operating expenses of $54 million and an unfavorable impact from foreign exchange of $3 million. The operational increase in the second quarter of 2014 was primarily due to additional overall expense associated with our acquisitions of the TR Corporate Solutions businesses in May 2013 and eSpeed in June 2013, and a loss on debt extinguishment, partially offset by a decrease in merger and strategic initiatives expense. The operational increase in the first six months of 2014 was primarily due to additional overall expense associated with our acquisitions of the TR Corporate Solutions businesses in May 2013 and eSpeed in June 2013, a loss on debt extinguishment and higher merger and strategic initiatives expense, partially offset by a decrease in the voluntary accommodation program expense and a decrease in restructuring charges.   Compensation and benefits expense increased in the second quarter and first six months of 2014 compared with the same periods in 2013 primarily due to additional salary expense resulting from our acquisitions of the TR Corporate Solutions businesses in May 2013 and eSpeed in June 2013, as well as higher share-based compensation expense. Headcount, including staff employed at consolidated entities where we have a controlling financial interest, increased to 3,762 employees at June 30, 2014 from 3,220 employees at June 30, 2013 primarily as a result of our acquisition of the TR Corporate Solutions businesses.   Depreciation and amortization expense increased in the second quarter and first six months of 2014 compared with the same periods in 2013 primarily due to additional amortization expense associated with acquired intangible assets, primarily relating to our acquisitions of the TR Corporate Solutions businesses in May 2013 and eSpeed in June 2013.   Professional and contract services expense increased in the second quarter and first six months of 2014 compared with the same periods in 2013 primarily due to revenue-related costs incurred as a result of our acquisition of the TR Corporate Solutions businesses in May 2013 and costs incurred for special legal expenses. The revenue-related costs are primarily due to the production and delivery of webcast events as well as other events and services.    Computer operations and data communications expense increased in the second quarter and first six months of 2014 compared with the same periods in 2013 primarily due to additional expense as a result of our acquisitions of the TR Corporate Solutions businesses in May 2013 and eSpeed in June 2013, as well as higher communication line costs.   Merger and strategic initiatives expense was $14 million in the second quarter and $42 million in the first six months of 2014 compared with $25 million in the second quarter and $33 million in the first six months of 2013. The costs in the second quarter of 2014 are primarily related to our acquisition of the TR Corporate Solutions businesses in May 2013 and other strategic initiatives. The costs in the first six months of 2014 and the second quarter and first six months of 2013 primarily relate to our acquisitions of the TR Corporate Solutions businesses in May 2013 and eSpeed in June 2013.         42     Table Of Contents   General, administrative and other expense increased in the second quarter and first six months of 2014 compared with the same periods in 2013 primarily due to additional expense associated with our acquisitions of the TR Corporate Solutions businesses in May 2013 and eSpeed in June 2013, a $9 million loss on extinguishment of debt, and an unfavorable impact from foreign exchange of $2 million in the second quarter of 2014 and $3 million in the first six months of 2014. See “Early Extinguishment of 2015 Notes,” of Note 8, “Debt Obligations,” to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our debt extinguishment.    Restructuring charges were $9 million in the first six months of 2013. Our restructuring program was completed in the first quarter of 2013. See Note 3, “Restructuring Charges,” to the condensed consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our restructuring charges recorded during the first six months of 2013.    Voluntary accommodation program expense in the first six months of 2013 relates to the one-time program for voluntary accommodations to qualifying members of up to $62 million, for which a liability was recorded as the program was approved by the SEC in March 2013. This program expanded the pool available to compensate members of The NASDAQ Stock Market for qualified losses arising directly from the system issues experienced with the Facebook IPO that occurred on May 18, 2012. Our liability was reduced to $44 million and payment of valid claims totaling $44 million was made in the fourth quarter of 2013.        Non-operating Income and Expenses    The following table shows our non-operating income and expenses:                                                                                                                                                                                      Three Months Ended June 30,        Percentage        Six Months Ended June 30,        Percentage               2014        2013        Change        2014        2013        Change               (in millions)                    (in millions)                  Interest income        $  1 				       $  2 				           (50.0)%        $  3 				       $  5 				           (40.0)%      Interest expense          (30) 				         (26) 				         15.4% 				         (59) 				         (50) 				         18.0% 				     Net interest expense          (29) 				         (24) 				         20.8% 				         (56) 				         (45) 				         24.4% 				     Asset impairment charges             -             -            -             -          (10) 				           #       Total non-operating expenses        $  (29) 				       $  (24) 				         20.8% 				       $  (56) 				       $  (55) 				         1.8% 				        #Denotes a variance equal to 100.0%.       Total non-operating expenses increased in the second quarter and first six months of 2014 compared with the same periods in 2013 primarily due to an increase in interest expense. Partially offsetting the increase in the first six months of 2014 were lower asset impairment charges as compared to those recorded during the first six months of 2013.    Interest Income   Interest income decreased in the second quarter and first six months of 2014 compared with the same periods in 2013 primarily due to a decrease in cash and cash equivalents in the first six months of 2014.   Interest Expense    Interest expense increased in the second quarter and first six months of 2014 compared with the same periods in 2013 primarily due to the issuance of our 2021 Notes in June 2013 and the issuance of our 2024 Notes in June 2014, partially offset by lower outstanding balances on our 2011 Credit Facility and the repayment of our 2.50% convertible senior notes in August 2013.   Interest expense for the second quarter of 2014 was $30 million, and was comprised of $28 million of interest expense, $1 million of non-cash debt issuance amortization expense, and $1 million of other bank and investment–related fees. Interest expense for the second quarter of 2013 was $26 million, and was comprised of $24 million of interest expense, $1 million of non-cash expense associated with the accretion of debt discounts and $1 million of non-cash debt issuance amortization expense.   Interest expense for the first six months of 2014 was $59 million, and was comprised of $56 million of interest expense, $2 million of non-cash debt issuance amortization expense, and $1 million of other bank and investment-related fees. Interest expense for the first six months of 2013 was $50 million, and was comprised of $44 million of interest expense, $2 million of non-cash expense associated with the accretion of debt discounts, $2 million of non-cash debt issuance amortization expense, and $2 million of other bank and investment-related fees.   See Note 8, “Debt Obligations,” to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our debt obligations.    Asset Impairment Charges       43     Table Of Contents   In the first six months of 2013, we recorded asset impairment charges of $10 million related to certain acquired intangible assets associated with customer relationships ($7 million) and a certain trade name ($3 million). See “Intangible Asset Impairment Charges,” of Note 5, “Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets,” to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion.    Tax Matters    NASDAQ OMX’s income tax provision was $61 million in the second quarter of 2014 and $114 million in the first six months of 2014 compared with $47 million in the second quarter of 2013 and $64 million in the first six months of 2013. The overall effective tax rate was 38% in the second quarter of 2014 and 36% in the first six months of 2014 compared with 35% in the second quarter of 2013 and 33% in the first six months of 2013. The higher effective tax rate in the second quarter and first six months of 2014 when compared with the same periods in 2013 is primarily due to a change in the geographic mix of earnings and losses. In addition, in the second quarter of 2014, we recorded adjustments related to our 2010 through 2012 tax return liabilities which resulted in an increase to the tax provision. The effective tax rate may vary from period to period depending on, among other factors, the geographic and business mix of earnings and losses. These same and other factors, including our history of pre-tax earnings and losses, are taken into account in assessing the ability to realize deferred tax assets. In order to recognize and measure our unrecognized tax benefits, management determines whether a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. Once it is determined that a position meets the recognition thresholds, the position is measured to determine the amount of benefit to be recognized in the condensed consolidated financial statements. Interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters are recognized in income tax expense.    NASDAQ OMX and its eligible subsidiaries file a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return and applicable state and local income tax returns and non-U.S. income tax returns. Federal income tax returns for the years 2007 through 2010 are currently under audit by the Internal Revenue Service and we are subject to examination for 2011 and 2012. Several state tax returns are currently under examination by the respective tax authorities for the years 2005 through 2012. Non-U.S. tax returns are subject to examination by the respective tax authorities for the years 2006 through 2012. We anticipate that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits at June 30, 2014 will significantly decrease in the next twelve months as we expect to settle certain tax audits. The final outcome of such audits cannot yet be determined. We anticipate that such adjustments will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.    In the fourth quarter of 2010, we received an appeal from the Finnish Tax Authority challenging certain interest expense deductions claimed by NASDAQ OMX in Finland for the year 2008. The appeal also demanded certain penalties be paid with regard to the company’s tax return filing position. In October 2012, the Finnish Appeals Board disagreed with the company’s tax return filing position for the years 2009 through 2011, even though the tax return position with respect to this deduction was previously reviewed and approved by the Finnish Tax Authority. In June 2014, the Finnish Administrative Court also disagreed with the company’s tax return filing position. Through June 30, 2014, we have recorded tax benefits of $21 million associated with this filing position. Of this amount we have paid $12 million to the Finnish tax authorities. We have also paid $11 million in interest and penalties. In 2014, we will pay $9 million, which represents the benefit taken in 2013 and the first six month of 2014. We expect the Finnish Supreme Administrative Court to agree with our position, which would result in an expected refund to NASDAQ OMX of $32 million.    From 2009 through 2012, we recorded tax benefits associated with certain interest expense incurred in Sweden. Our position is supported by a 2011 ruling we received from the Swedish Supreme Administrative Court. However, under new legislation effective January 1, 2013, limitations are imposed on certain forms of interest expense. Because this legislation is unclear with regard to our ability to continue to claim such interest deductions, NASDAQ OMX filed an application for an advance tax ruling with the Swedish Tax Council for Advance Tax Rulings. In June 2014, we received an unfavorable ruling from the Swedish Tax Council for Advance Tax Rulings. We will appeal this ruling to the Swedish Supreme Administrative Court. We expect to receive a favorable decision from the Swedish Supreme Administrative Court. Since January 1, 2013, we have recorded tax benefits of $24 million, or $0.14 per diluted share, related to this matter. We expect to record recurring quarterly tax benefits of $4 million to $5 million with respect to this issue for the foreseeable future.    In December 2012, the Swedish Tax Agency approved our 2010 amended VAT tax return and we received a cash refund for the amount claimed. In 2013, we filed VAT tax returns for 2011 and 2012 and utilized the same approach which was approved for the 2010 filing. However, even though the VAT return position was previously reviewed and approved by the Swedish Tax Agency, we were informed by the Swedish Tax Agency that our VAT refund claims for 2011 and 2012 are not valid. However, they will not seek reimbursement of the 2010 refund. We have appealed the finding by the Swedish Tax Agency to the Administrative Court. For the period January 1, 2011 through June 30, 2014, we have recorded benefits of $16 million associated with this position.    Non-GAAP Financial Measures    In addition to disclosing results determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we also have provided non-GAAP net income attributable to NASDAQ OMX and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. Management uses this non-GAAP information internally, along with U.S. GAAP information, in evaluating our performance and in making financial and operational decisions.        44     Table Of Contents   We believe our presentation of these measures provides investors with greater transparency and supplemental data relating to our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we believe the presentation of these measures is useful to investors for period-to-period comparison of results as the items described below do not reflect operating performance. These measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, U.S. GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. Investors should not rely on any single financial measure when evaluating our business. We recommend investors review the U.S. GAAP financial measures included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including our condensed consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto. When viewed in conjunction with our U.S. GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliation, we believe these non-GAAP measures provide greater transparency and a more complete understanding of factors affecting our business than U.S. GAAP measures alone. Our management uses these measures to evaluate operating performance, and management decisions during the reporting period are made by excluding certain items that we believe have less significance on, or do not impact, the day-to-day performance of our business. We understand that analysts and investors regularly rely on non-GAAP financial measures, such as non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, to assess operating performance. We use non-GAAP net income attributable to NASDAQ OMX and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share because they more clearly highlight trends in our business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on U.S. GAAP financial measures, since these measures eliminate from our results specific financial items that have less bearing on our operating performance. Non-GAAP net income attributable to NASDAQ OMX for the periods presented below is calculated by adjusting net income attributable to NASDAQ OMX for charges or gains related to acquisition and divestiture transactions, integration activities related to acquisitions, other significant infrequent charges or gains and their related income tax effects that are not related to our core business. We do not believe these items are representative of our future operating performance since these charges were not consistent with our normal operating performance.    Non-GAAP adjustments for the quarter ended June 30, 2014 primarily related to the following:   (i) merger and strategic initiatives costs of $14 million primarily related to our acquisition of the TR Corporate Solutions businesses and other strategic initiatives, (ii) loss on extinguishment of debt of $9 million related to our 2015 Notes, (iii) special legal expense of $1 million, (iv) adjustment to the income tax provision of $7 million to reflect these non-GAAP adjustments, and (v) significant tax adjustments, net of $2 million due to adjustments related to our 2010 through 2012 tax return liabilities which resulted in an increase to the tax provision.    Non-GAAP adjustments for the quarter ended June 30, 2013 primarily related to the following:    (i) merger and strategic initiatives costs of $25 million primarily related to our acquisitions of eSpeed and the TR Corporate Solutions businesses, and (ii) adjustment to the income tax provision of $8 million to reflect these non-GAAP adjustments.    Non-GAAP adjustments for the six months ended June 30, 2014 primarily related to the following:   (i) merger and strategic initiatives costs of $42 million primarily related to our acquisition of the TR Corporate Solutions businesses and other strategic initiatives, (ii) loss on extinguishment of debt of $9 million related to our 2015 Notes, (iii) special legal expense of $2 million, (iv) adjustment to the income tax provision of $15 million to reflect these non-GAAP adjustments, and (v) significant tax adjustments, net of $2 million due to adjustments related to our 2010 through 2012 tax return liabilities which resulted in an increase to the tax provision.    Non-GAAP adjustments for the six months ended June 30, 2013 primarily related to the following:   (i) merger and strategic initiatives costs of $33 million primarily related to our acquisitions of eSpeed and the TR Corporate Solutions businesses, (ii) expense related to the one-time program for voluntary accommodations to qualifying members of up to $62 million. This program expanded the pool available to compensate members of The NASDAQ Stock Market for qualified losses arising directly from the system issues experienced with the Facebook IPO that occurred on May 18, 2012. Our liability was reduced to $44 million and payment of valid claims totaling $44 million was made in the fourth quarter of 2013, (iii) expense related to an SEC matter of $10 million, (iv) asset impairment charges of $10 million related to certain acquired intangible assets associated with customer relationships and a certain trade name, (v) restructuring charges of $9 million, (vi) special legal expense of $2 million, and (vii) adjustment to the income tax provision of $43 million to reflect these non-GAAP adjustments.

Liquidity and Capital Resources    Global markets and economic conditions continue to improve from adverse levels experienced during the past several years and investors and lenders remain cautiously optimistic about the pace of the global economic recovery. A lack of confidence in the prospects for growth could result in sporadic increases in market volatility and lackluster trading volumes, which could in turn affect our ability to obtain additional funding from lenders. Currently, our cost and availability of funding remain healthy.        46     Table Of Contents   Historically, we have funded our operating activities and met our commitments through cash generated by operations, augmented by the periodic issuance of our common stock and debt obligations. In May 2014, NASDAQ OMX issued the 2024 Notes. In June 2014, we used the majority of the net proceeds from the offering of the 2024 Notes, along with cash on hand, to repay in full and terminate our 2015 Notes. We used the remaining proceeds to repay a portion of the 2016 Term Loan. See “4.25% Senior Unsecured Notes,” and “2011 Credit Facility,” of Note 8, “Debt Obligations,” to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion. In June 2013, NASDAQ OMX issued the 2021 Notes. We used the majority of the net proceeds from the offering of the 2021 Notes to fund the cash consideration payable by us for the acquisition of eSpeed and related expenses. We used the remaining proceeds from the 2021 Notes for general corporate purposes. As part of the acquisition of eSpeed, NASDAQ OMX has contingent future obligations to issue 992,247 shares of NASDAQ OMX common stock annually which approximated certain tax benefits associated with the transaction of $484 million. Such contingent future issuances of NASDAQ OMX common stock will be paid ratably through 2027 if NASDAQ OMX’s total gross revenues equal or exceed $25 million in each such year. The contingent future issuances of NASDAQ OMX common stock are subject to anti-dilution protections and acceleration upon certain events.    In addition to these cash sources, we have a $750 million revolving credit commitment (including a swingline facility and letter of credit facility) under our senior unsecured five-year credit facility. During the first quarter of 2014, we repaid the total amount drawn on the revolving credit commitment of $120 million. As of June 30, 2014, availability under the revolving credit commitment was $750 million. See “2011 Credit Facility,” of Note 8, “Debt Obligations,” to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion.    In the near term, we expect that our operations and availability under our revolving credit commitment will provide sufficient cash to fund our operating expenses, capital expenditures, debt repayments, any share repurchases, and any dividends.    Working capital (calculated as current assets less current liabilities) was $294 million at June 30, 2014, compared with $363 million at December 31, 2013, a decrease of $69 million.    Principal factors that could affect the availability of our internally-generated funds include:    •deterioration of our revenues in any of our business segments;    •changes in our working capital requirements; and    •an increase in our expenses.    Principal factors that could affect our ability to obtain cash from external sources include:    •operating covenants contained in our credit facility that limit our total borrowing capacity;    •increases in interest rates applicable to our floating rate loans under our credit facility;    •credit rating downgrades, which could limit our access to additional debt;    •a decrease in the market price of our common stock; and    •volatility in the public debt and equity markets.    The following sections discuss the effects of changes in our financial assets, debt obligations, clearing and broker-dealer net capital requirements, and cash flows on our liquidity and capital resources.   Financial Assets    The following table summarizes our financial assets:                                                                                      June 30, 2014        December 31, 2013                                              (in millions)      Cash and cash equivalents        $  314 				       $  398 				     Restricted cash          39 				         84 				     Financial investments, at fair value          203 				         189 				     Total financial assets        $  556 				       $  671 				            Cash and Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash    Cash and cash equivalents include cash in banks and all non-restricted highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase. The balance retained in cash and cash equivalents is a function of anticipated or possible short-term cash needs, prevailing interest rates, our investment policy, and alternative investment choices. As of June 30, 2014, our cash and cash equivalents of $314 million were primarily invested in money market funds. In the long-term, we may use both internally generated funds and external sources to satisfy our debt obligations and other long-term liabilities. Cash and cash equivalents as of      47     Table Of Contents   June 30, 2014 decreased $84 million from December 31, 2013 primarily due to net cash used in financing and investing activities, partially offset by net cash provided by operating activities. See “Cash Flow Analysis” below for further discussion.    Current restricted cash was $39 million as of June 30, 2014 and $84 million as of December 31, 2013, a decrease of $45 million. The decrease is primarily due to restricted cash that had been held at NOS Clearing. In the second quarter of 2014, NOS Clearing was fully integrated into NASDAQ OMX Nordic Clearing and is now covered under the regulatory capital structure and liability waterfall of NASDAQ OMX Nordic Clearing. As of June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013, current restricted cash included cash held for regulatory purposes and other requirements and is not available for general use by us. As of December 31, 2013, current restricted cash also included restricted cash held at NOS Clearing. Current restricted cash is classified as restricted cash in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.   Repatriation of Cash    Our cash and cash equivalents held outside of the U.S. in various foreign subsidiaries totaled $83 million as of June 30, 2014 and $159 million as of December 31, 2013. The remaining balance held in the U.S. totaled $231 million as of June 30, 2014 and $239 million as of December 31, 2013.    Unremitted earnings of subsidiaries outside of the U.S. are used to finance our international operations and are generally considered to be indefinitely reinvested. It is not our current intent to change this position. However, the majority of cash held outside the U.S. is available for repatriation, but under current law, could subject us to additional U.S. income taxes, less applicable foreign tax credits.    Share Repurchase Program    In the third quarter of 2012, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $300 million of our outstanding common stock. These purchases may be made from time to time at prevailing market prices in open market purchases, privately-negotiated transactions, block purchase techniques or otherwise, as determined by our management. The purchases are funded from existing cash balances. The share repurchase program may be suspended, modified or discontinued at any time.    During the first six months of 2014, we repurchased 2,557,920 shares of our common stock at an average price of $36.46, for an aggregate purchase price of $93 million. The shares repurchased under the share repurchase program are available for general corporate purposes. As of June 30, 2014, the remaining amount authorized for share repurchases under the program authorized in the third quarter of 2012 was $122 million.   Cash Dividends on Common Stock    In June 2014, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per share on our outstanding common stock and in March 2014, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.13 per share on our outstanding common stock. See “Cash Dividends on Common Stock,” of Note 11, “NASDAQ OMX Stockholders’ Equity,” to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the dividends.    In July 2014, the board of directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per share on our outstanding common stock. The dividend is payable on September 26, 2014 to shareholders of record at the close of business on September 12, 2014. Future declarations of quarterly dividends and the establishment of future record and payment dates are subject to approval by the board of directors.   Financial Investments, at Fair Value    Our financial investments, at fair value totaled $203 million as of June 30, 2014 and $189 million as of December 31, 2013 and are primarily comprised of trading securities, mainly Swedish government debt securities. Of these securities, $172 million as of June 30, 2014 and $167 million as of December 31, 2013 are assets utilized to meet regulatory capital requirements primarily for clearing operations at NASDAQ OMX Nordic Clearing. See Note 6, “Investments,” to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our trading securities.    Debt Obligations    The following table summarizes our debt obligations by contractual maturity:                                                                                                          Maturity Date        June 30, 2014        December 31, 2013                                                                      (in millions)      4.00% senior unsecured notes        Repaid June 2014             -          400 				     $1.2 billion senior unsecured five-year credit facility:                                          $450 million senior unsecured term loan facility        September 2016          123 				         349 				     48     Table Of Contents       $750 million revolving credit commitment        September 2016             -          95 				     5.25% senior unsecured notes (net of discount)        January 2018          368 				         368 				     5.55% senior unsecured notes (net of discount)        January 2020          599 				         598 				     3.875% senior unsecured notes (net of discount)            June 2021          820 				         824 				     4.25% senior unsecured notes (net of discount)            June 2024          498 				            -      Total debt obligations                      2,408 				         2,634 				     Less current portion                         -          (45) 				     Total long-term debt obligations                    $  2,408 				       $  2,589 				        In addition to the $750 million revolving credit commitment, we also have other credit facilities related to our Nordic clearing operations in order to provide further liquidity and for default protection. At June 30, 2014, these credit facilities, which are available in multiple currencies, primarily Swedish Krona, totaled $317 million ($227 million in available liquidity and $90 million for default protection), none of which was utilized. At December 31, 2013, these credit facilities, which are available in multiple currencies, primarily Swedish Krona, totaled $312 million ($219 million in available liquidity and $93 million for default protection), of which $11 million was utilized.    Early Extinguishment of 2015 Notes   In May 2014, NASDAQ OMX issued the 2024 Notes. In June 2014, we used the majority of the net proceeds from the 2024 Notes, along with cash on hand, to repay in full and terminate our 2015 Notes and repay a portion of the term loan under our senior credit facility. See “4.25% Senior Unsecured Notes,” and “2011 Credit Facility,” of Note 8, “Debt Obligations,” to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion. In connection with the early extinguishment of the 2015 Notes, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $9 million which is included in general, administrative and other expense in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014.    At June 30, 2014, we were in compliance with the covenants of all of our debt obligations.    See Note 8, “Debt Obligations,” to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our debt obligations.    Clearing and Broker-Dealer Net Capital Requirements    Clearing Operations Regulatory Capital Requirements    We are required to maintain minimum levels of regulatory capital for the clearing operations of NASDAQ OMX Nordic Clearing. The level of regulatory capital required to be maintained is dependent upon many factors, including market conditions and creditworthiness of the counterparty. At June 30, 2014, our required regulatory capital consisted of $172 million of Swedish government debt securities that are included in financial investments, at fair value in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.    In addition, we have available credit facilities of $90 million which provide default protection for our Nordic clearing operations.    Broker-Dealer Net Capital Requirements    Our broker-dealer subsidiaries, Nasdaq Execution Services, NASDAQ Options Services, Execution Access and NPM Securities, LLC, are subject to regulatory requirements intended to ensure their general financial soundness and liquidity. These requirements obligate these subsidiaries to comply with minimum net capital requirements. At June 30, 2014, Nasdaq Execution Services was required to maintain minimum net capital of $0.3 million and had total net capital of approximately $8.6 million, or $8.3 million in excess of the minimum amount required. At June 30, 2014, NASDAQ Options Services also was required to maintain minimum net capital of $0.3 million and had total net capital of approximately $0.6 million, or $0.3 million in excess of the minimum amount required. At June 30, 2014, Execution Access was required to maintain minimum net capital of $0.5 million and had total net capital of $39.5 million, or $39.0 million in excess of the minimum amount required. At June 30, 2014, NPM Securities had total net capital of $0.2 million. The minimum net capital required was immaterial.    Other Capital Requirements    NASDAQ Execution Services also is required to maintain a $2 million minimum level of net capital under our clearing arrangement with The Options Clearing Corporation, or OCC.    Cash Flow Analysis    The following tables summarize the changes in cash flows:                                                                                                     49     Table Of Contents                Six Months Ended June 30,                           2014        2013        Percentage Change                                                          (in millions)                  Net cash provided by (used in):                                          Operating activities        $  383 				       $  255 				         50.2% 				     Investing activities          (94) 				         (1,142) 				           (91.8)%      Financing activities          (373) 				         777 				           #       Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents             -          (8) 				           #       Net decrease in cash and cash equivalents          (84) 				         (118) 				           (28.8)%      Cash and cash equivalents at the beginning of period          398 				         497 				           (19.9)%      Cash and cash equivalents at the end of period        $  314 				       $  379 				           (17.2)%         #Denotes a variance equal to or greater than 100.0%.    Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities    The following items impacted our net cash provided by operating activities for the six months ended June 30, 2014:    •Net income of $205 million, plus:    • Non-cash items of $110 million comprised primarily of $69 million of depreciation and amortization expense, $30 million of share-based compensation expense, $20 million of merger and strategic initiatives expense, partially offset by deferred income taxes of $21 million.   •Increase in deferred revenue of $99 million mainly due to Listing Services’ annual billings.   •Increase in Section 31 fees payable to the SEC of $72 million primarily due to timing of payments, which are made twice a year in September and March, partially offset by higher dollar value traded on the NASDAQ and NASDAQ OMX BX trading systems.   Partially offset by a:    •Decrease in accrued personnel costs of $54 million primarily due to the payment of our 2013 incentive compensation in the first quarter of 2014, partially offset by the 2014 accrual.   •Decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $36 million reflecting a decrease in interest payable as well as the timing of trade payables.   •Increase in accounts receivable, net of $10 million primarily due to the timing of collections and activity.   The following items impacted our net cash provided by operating activities for the six months ended June 30, 2013:    •Net income of $130 million, plus:    • Non-cash items of $44 million comprised primarily of $55 million of depreciation and amortization expense, $18 million of share-based compensation expense and $10 million of asset impairment charges, partially offset by deferred income taxes of $28 million and excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation of $13 million.   •Increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $83 million primarily due to the recording of our voluntary accommodation program liability and the timing of payments.   •Increase in Section 31 fees payable to the SEC of $48 million primarily due to the timing of payments which are made twice a year in September and March.   •Increase in deferred revenue of $47 million mainly due to Listing Services’ annual billings.   •Increase in other liabilities of $16 million mainly due to increases in accrued taxes and an increase related to unsettled trades within NASDAQ OMX Commodities related to our U.K. power business.   Partially offset by an:    •Increase in other assets of $61 million primarily reflecting a $19 million payment to the Finland Tax Authority related to a tax assessment, a $19 million deposit made in connection with a clearing agreement entered into by our eSpeed business, a $10 million increase related to unsettled trades within NASDAQ OMX Commodities related to our U.K. power business and an $8 million increase related to deferred costs associated with the timing and delivery of technology.    •Increase in accounts receivable, net of $22 million primarily due to the timing of collections and an increase in income tax receivables.        50     Table Of Contents   •Decrease in accrued personnel costs of $30 million primarily due to the payment of our 2012 incentive compensation in the first quarter of 2013, partially offset by the 2013 accrual.       Net Cash Used in Investing Activities    Net cash used in investing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2014 primarily consisted of purchases of trading and available-for-sale investment securities and purchases of property and equipment, partially offset by proceeds from sales and redemptions of trading securities.   Net cash used in investing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2013 primarily consisted of cash utilized to fund the acquisitions of eSpeed and the TR Corporate Solutions businesses, purchases of trading securities, purchases of property and equipment, cash paid for our increased ownership interest in LCH and our equity method investment in TOM, partially offset by proceeds from sales and redemptions of trading securities.   Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities    Net cash used in financing activities in the six months ended June 30, 2014 primarily consisted of $754 million of cash used in connection with the repayment of debt obligations, which consisted of a $408 million payment to repay in full and terminate our 2015 Notes, a required quarterly principal payment of $22 million and an optional prepayment of $204 million on our 2016 Term Loan, reflecting all mandatory principal payments required until maturity in September 2016, and the repayment of the total amount drawn on the revolving credit commitment of $120 million, which included $25 million of proceeds received during the three months ended March 31, 2014. In addition, cash used in financing activities included $93 million related to the repurchase of our common stock and $47 million related to cash dividends paid on our common stock. Partially offsetting these decreases were net proceeds received of $494 million from the issuance of our 2024 Notes.    Net cash provided by financing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2013 primarily consisted of proceeds received from the issuance of the 2021 Notes and a partial utilization under our revolving credit commitment, partially offset by $43 million related to cash dividends paid on our common stock and required quarterly principal payments totaling $23 million made on the 2016 Term Loan.   For further discussion of our debt obligations, see Note 8, “Debt Obligations,” to the condensed consolidated financial statements. For further discussion of our share repurchase program, see “Share Repurchase Program,” of Note 11, “NASDAQ OMX Stockholders’ Equity,” to the condensed consolidated financial statements.           Contractual Obligations and Contingent Commitments    NASDAQ OMX has contractual obligations to make future payments under debt obligations by contract maturity, minimum rental commitments under non-cancelable operating leases, net and other obligations. The following table shows these contractual obligations as of June 30, 2014:                                                                                                                                                              Payments Due by Period      Contractual Obligations        Total        Remainder of 2014        2015-2016        2017-2018        2019-Thereafter                                                                                  (in millions)      Debt obligations by contract maturity(1)        $  3,131 				       $  38 				       $  337 				       $  572 				       $  2,184 				     Minimum rental commitments under non-cancelable operating leases, net(2)          411 				         40 				         146 				         85 				         140 				     Other obligations(3)          20 				         11 				         9 				            -             -      Total        $  3,562 				       $  89 				       $  492 				       $  657 				       $  2,324 				        (1)Our debt obligations include both principal and interest obligations. At June 30, 2014, an interest rate of 1.52% was used to compute the amount of the contractual obligations for interest on the 2016 Term Loan. All other debt obligations were calculated on a 360-day basis at the contractual fixed rate multiplied by the aggregate principal amount at June 30, 2014. See Note 8, “Debt Obligations,” to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion.    (2)We lease some of our office space and equipment under non-cancelable operating leases with third parties and sublease office space to third parties. Some of our leases contain renewal options and escalation clauses based on increases in property taxes and building operating costs.   (3)In connection with our acquisitions of FTEN and Glide Technologies, we entered into escrow agreements to secure the payment of post-closing adjustments and to ensure other closing conditions. At June 30, 2014, these agreements provide for future payments of $10 million and are included in other current liabilities and other non-current liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. In addition, other obligations include future transition service agreement payments associated with      51     Table Of Contents   the acquisition of the TR Corporate Solutions businesses and the second installment payment related to the acquisition of the remaining 28% ownership interest in BWise, which is expected to be paid in 2015.       Non-Cash Contingent Consideration   As part of the eSpeed purchase price consideration, we have agreed to future annual issuances of 992,247 shares of NASDAQ OMX common stock which approximated certain tax benefits associated with the transaction. Such contingent future issuances of NASDAQ OMX common stock will be paid ratably through 2027 if NASDAQ OMX’s total gross revenues equal or exceed $25 million in each such year. The contingent future issuances of NASDAQ OMX common stock are subject to anti-dilution protections and acceleration upon certain events.   Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements    Default Fund Contributions and Margin Deposits Received for Clearing Operations    Default Fund Contributions    Clearing members’ eligible contributions may include cash and non-cash contributions. Cash contributions are invested by NASDAQ OMX Nordic Clearing in accordance with its investment policies and are included in default funds and margin deposits in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. However, non-cash contributions, which include highly rated government debt securities that must meet the investment policies of NASDAQ OMX Nordic Clearing, as well as pledged cash, are pledged assets that are not recorded in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as NASDAQ OMX Nordic Clearing does not take legal ownership of these assets and the risks and rewards remain with the clearing members. These pledged assets are held at a nominee account in NASDAQ OMX Nordic Clearing’s name for the benefit of the clearing members and are immediately accessible by NASDAQ OMX Nordic Clearing in the event of default. The pledged asset balances may fluctuate over time due to changes in the amount of deposits required and whether members choose to provide cash or non-cash contributions. See Note 14, “Clearing Operations,” to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our clearing operations and default fund contributions.    Margin Deposits Received for Clearing Operations    NASDAQ OMX Nordic Clearing requires all clearing members to provide collateral, which may consist of cash and eligible securities, in a pledged bank account and/or an on-demand guarantee, to guarantee performance on the clearing members’ open positions, or initial margin. In addition, clearing members must also provide collateral to cover the daily margin call as needed, which is in addition to the initial margin. Pledged collateral is held at a nominee account in NASDAQ OMX Nordic Clearing’s name for the benefit of the clearing members and is immediately accessible by NASDAQ OMX Nordic Clearing in the event of default. The pledged collateral is not recorded in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as all risks and rewards of collateral ownership, including interest, belong to the counterparty. Clearing member pledged collateral related to our clearing operations was $7.1 billion as of June 30, 2014 and $9.5 billion as of December 31, 2013. NASDAQ OMX Nordic Clearing maintains and manages all cash deposits related to margin collateral and records these cash deposits in default funds and margin deposits in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as both a current asset and current liability.   NASDAQ OMX Nordic Clearing mark-to-market all outstanding contracts, requiring payment from clearing members whose positions have lost value. The mark-to-market process helps identify any clearing members that may not be able to satisfy their financial obligations in a timely manner which helps NASDAQ OMX Nordic Clearing manage the risk of a clearing member defaulting due to exceptionally large losses. In the event of a default, NASDAQ OMX Nordic Clearing can access these margin deposits to cover the defaulting member’s losses.    Guarantees Issued and Credit Facilities Available    In addition to the collateral pledged by clearing members discussed above, we have obtained financial guarantees and credit facilities which are guaranteed by us through counter indemnities, to provide further liquidity and default protection. Financial guarantees issued to us totaled $28 million at June 30, 2014 and $20 million at December 31, 2013. At June 30, 2014, credit facilities, which are available in multiple currencies, primarily Swedish Krona, totaled $317 million ($227 million in available liquidity and $90 million for default protection), none of which was utilized. At December 31, 2013, these facilities totaled $312 million ($219 million in available liquidity and $93 million for default protection), of which $11 million was utilized.    Execution Access has a clearing arrangement with Cantor Fitzgerald. As of June 30, 2014, we have contributed $19 million of clearing deposits to Cantor Fitzgerald in connection with this clearing arrangement. These deposits are recorded in other current assets in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Some of the trading activity in Execution Access is cleared by Cantor Fitzgerald through FICC, and the balance is cleared non-FICC. Execution Access assumes the counterparty risk of clients that do not clear through FICC. Counterparty risk of clients exists for Execution Access between the trade date and settlement date of the individual transactions, which is one business day. All of Execution Access’ obligations under the clearing arrangement with Cantor Fitzgerald are guaranteed by NASDAQ OMX. Some of the non-FICC counterparties are required to post collateral, provide principal letters, or provide other forms of credit enhancement to Execution Access for the purpose of mitigating counterparty risk.        52     Table Of Contents   We believe that the potential for us to be required to make payments under these arrangements is mitigated through the pledged collateral and our risk management policies. Accordingly, no contingent liability is recorded in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets for these arrangements.    Leases    We lease some of our office space and equipment under non-cancelable operating leases with third parties and sublease office space to third parties. Some of our lease agreements contain renewal options and escalation clauses based on increases in property taxes and building operating costs.    Other Guarantees    We have provided other guarantees of $15 million as of June 30, 2014 and $17 million at December 31, 2013. These guarantees primarily related to obligations for our rental and leasing contracts as well as performance guarantees on certain Market Technology contracts related to the delivery of software technology and support services. We have received financial guarantees from various financial institutions to support these guarantees.    We believe that the potential for us to be required to make payments under these arrangements is unlikely. Accordingly, no contingent liability is recorded in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets for the above guarantees.    In connection with the launch of NASDAQ OMX NLX, we have entered into agreements with certain members which may require us to make payments if certain financial goals are achieved. Since the amount of these payments is not currently probable and cannot be quantified as of June 30, 2014, no contingent liability is recorded in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets for these payments.    Routing Brokerage Activities    Our broker-dealer subsidiaries, Nasdaq Execution Services and NASDAQ Options Services, provide guarantees to securities clearinghouses and exchanges under their standard membership agreements, which require members to guarantee the performance of other members. If a member becomes unable to satisfy its obligations to a clearinghouse or exchange, other members would be required to meet its shortfalls. To mitigate these performance risks, the exchanges and clearinghouses often require members to post collateral, as well as meet certain minimum financial standards. Nasdaq Execution Services’ and NASDAQ Options Services’ maximum potential liability under these arrangements cannot be quantified. However, we believe that the potential for Nasdaq Execution Services and NASDAQ Options Services to be required to make payments under these arrangements is unlikely. Accordingly, no contingent liability is recorded in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets for these arrangements.    Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk    Market risk represents the potential for losses that may result from changes in the market value of a financial instrument due to changes in market conditions. As a result of our operating, investing and financing activities, we are exposed to market risks such as interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk. We are also exposed to credit risk as a result of our normal business activities.    We have implemented policies and procedures to measure, manage, monitor and report risk exposures, which are reviewed regularly by management and the board of directors. We identify risk exposures and monitor and manage such risks on a daily basis.    We perform sensitivity analyses to determine the effects of market risk exposures. We may use derivative instruments solely to hedge financial risks related to our financial positions or risks that are incurred during the normal course of business. We do not use derivative instruments for speculative purposes.    Interest Rate Risk    The following table summarizes our financial assets and liabilities that are subject to interest rate risk as of June 30, 2014:                                                                                                              Financial Assets        Financial Liabilities(1)        Negative impact of a 100bp adverse shift in interest rate(2)                                                          (in millions)      Floating rate positions(3)        $  3,135 				       $  2,702 				       $  (5) 				     Fixed rate positions             -          2,291 				            -         (1)Represents total contractual debt obligations and amounts related to default fund contributions and margin deposits.    (2)Annualized impact of a 100 basis point parallel adverse shift in the yield curve.    (3)Includes floating rate and fixed interest rates with a maturity or reset date due within 12 months.        We are exposed to cash flow risk on floating rate financial assets of $3,135 million and financial liabilities of $2,702 million at June 30, 2014. When interest rates on financial assets of floating rate positions decrease, net interest income decreases. When interest      53     Table Of Contents   rates on financial liabilities of floating rate positions increase, net interest expense increases. Based on June 30, 2014 positions, each 1.0% adverse change in interest rate would impact annual pre-tax income by $5 million related to our floating positions.   Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk    As a leading global exchange group, we are subject to foreign currency translation risk. For the three months ended June 30, 2014, approximately 33.6% of our revenues less transaction rebates, brokerage, clearance and exchange fees and 21.4% of our operating income were derived from currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the Swedish Krona, Euro, Norwegian Krone, Danish Krone, and British Pound. For the six months ended June 30, 2014, approximately 34.0% of our revenues less transaction rebates, brokerage, clearance and exchange fees and 24.1% of our operating income were derived from currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the Swedish Krona, Euro, Norwegian Krone, Danish Krone, and British Pound.    Our primary exposure to foreign currency denominated revenues less transaction rebates, brokerage, clearance and exchange fees and operating income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014 is presented in the following table:                                                                                                                                                                                      Swedish Krona        Euro        Norwegian Krone        Danish Krone        British Pound        Other Foreign Currencies                                                                                              (in millions, except currency rate)      Three months ended June 30, 2014                                                                              Average foreign currency rate to the U.S. dollar          0.1514 				         1.3712 				         0.1670 				         0.1837 				         1.6836 				           #       Percentage of revenues less transaction rebates, brokerage, clearance and exchange fees          19.1% 				         4.1% 				         1.9% 				         2.6% 				         2.8% 				         3.1% 				     Percentage of operating income          21.3% 				         0.9% 				         1.8% 				         5.0% 				           (4.4)%            (3.2)%      Impact of a 10% adverse currency fluctuation on revenues less transaction rebates, brokerage, clearance and exchange fees        $  (10) 				       $  (2) 				       $  (1) 				       $  (1) 				       $  (2) 				       $  (2) 				     Impact of a 10% adverse currency fluctuation on operating income        $  (4) 				       $     -        $     -        $  (1) 				       $  (1) 				       $  (1) 				                                                                                    Six months ended June 30, 2014                                                                              Average foreign currency rate to the U.S. dollar          0.1531 				            1.3709          0.1656 				         0.1837 				         1.6693 				           #       Percentage of revenues less transaction rebates, brokerage, clearance and exchange fees          18.9% 				         4.2% 				         2.3% 				         2.6% 				         2.9% 				         3.1% 				     Percentage of operating income          21.7% 				         1.8% 				         3.0% 				         5.3% 				           (4.6)%            (3.1)%      Impact of a 10% adverse currency fluctuation on revenues less transaction rebates, brokerage, clearance and exchange fees        $  (20) 				       $  (4) 				       $  (3) 				       $  (3) 				       $  (3) 				       $  (3) 				     Impact of a 10% adverse currency fluctuation on operating income        $  (8) 				       $  (1) 				       $  (1) 				       $  (2) 				       $  (2) 				       $  (1) 				        #Represents multiple foreign currency rates.    Our investments in foreign subsidiaries are exposed to volatility in currency exchange rates through translation of the foreign subsidiaries’ net assets or equity to U.S. dollars. Substantially all of our foreign subsidiaries operate in functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates may create volatility in our results of operations as we are required to translate the balance sheets and operational results of these foreign currency denominated subsidiaries into U.S. dollars for consolidated reporting. The translation of foreign subsidiaries’ non-U.S. dollar balance sheets into U.S. dollars for consolidated reporting results in a cumulative translation adjustment which is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss within stockholders’ equity in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.    Our primary exposure to net assets in foreign currencies as of June 30, 2014 is presented in the following table:                                                                                      Net Assets        Impact of a 10% Adverse Currency Fluctuation                                              (in millions)      Swedish Krona(1)        $  4,172 				       $  (417) 				     Norwegian Krone          258 				         (26) 				     Euro          167 				         (17) 				     British Pound          161 				         (16) 				     Australian Dollar          101 				         (10) 				         (1)Includes goodwill of $3,271 million and intangible assets, net of $989 million.        54     Table Of Contents   Credit Risk    Credit risk is the potential loss due to the default or deterioration in credit quality of customers or counterparties. We are exposed to credit risk from third parties, including customers, counterparties and clearing agents. These parties may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failure or other reasons. We limit our exposure to credit risk by rigorously evaluating the counterparties with which we make investments and execute agreements. The financial investment portfolio objective is to invest in securities to preserve principal while maximizing yields, without significantly increasing risk. Credit risk associated with investments is minimized substantially by ensuring that these financial assets are placed with governments which have investment grade ratings, well-capitalized financial institutions and other creditworthy counterparties.    Our subsidiaries Nasdaq Execution Services and NASDAQ Options Services may be exposed to credit risk, due to the default of trading counterparties, in connection with the routing services they provide for our trading customers. System trades in cash equities routed to other market centers for members of our cash equity exchanges are routed by Nasdaq Execution Services for clearing to the National Securities Clearing Corporation, or NSCC. In this function, Nasdaq Execution Services is to be neutral by the end of the trading day, but may be exposed to intraday risk if a trade extends beyond the trading day and into the next day, thereby leaving Nasdaq Execution Services susceptible to counterparty risk in the period between accepting the trade and routing it to the clearinghouse. In this interim period, Nasdaq Execution Services is not novating like a clearing broker but instead is subject to the short-term risk of counterparty failure before the clearinghouse enters the transaction. Once the clearinghouse officially accepts the trade for novation, Nasdaq Execution Services is legally removed from risk. System trades in derivative contracts for the opening and closing cross and trades routed to other market centers are cleared by NASDAQ Options Services, as a member of the OCC. For these trades, novation is done at the end of the trading day, and settlement is complete by 10:00 am on the following day.    Pursuant to the rules of the NSCC and Nasdaq Execution Services’ clearing agreement, Nasdaq Execution Services is liable for any losses incurred due to a counterparty or a clearing agent’s failure to satisfy its contractual obligations, either by making payment or delivering securities. Pursuant to the rules of the OCC and NASDAQ Options Services’ clearing agreement, NASDAQ Options Services is liable for any losses incurred due to a counterparty or a clearing agent’s failure to satisfy its contractual obligations, either by making payment or delivering securities. Adverse movements in the prices of securities and derivative contracts that are subject to these transactions can increase our credit risk. However, we believe that the risk of material loss is limited, as Nasdaq Execution Services’ and NASDAQ Options Services’ customers are not permitted to trade on margin and NSCC and OCC rules limit counterparty risk on self-cleared transactions by establishing credit limits and capital deposit requirements for all brokers that clear with NSCC and OCC. Historically, neither Nasdaq Execution Services nor NASDAQ Options Services has incurred a liability due to a customer’s failure to satisfy its contractual obligations as counterparty to a system trade. Credit difficulties or insolvency, or the perceived possibility of credit difficulties or insolvency, of one or more larger or visible market participants could also result in market-wide credit difficulties or other market disruptions.    Execution Access is an introducing broker which operates the eSpeed trading platform for U.S. Treasury securities. Execution Access has a clearing arrangement with Cantor Fitzgerald. As of June 30, 2014, we have contributed $19 million of clearing deposits to Cantor Fitzgerald in connection with this clearing arrangement. These deposits are recorded in other current assets in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Some of the trading activity in Execution Access is cleared by Cantor Fitzgerald through FICC, and the balance is cleared non-FICC. Execution Access assumes the counterparty risk of clients that do not clear through FICC. Counterparty risk of clients exists for Execution Access between the trade date and settlement date of the individual transactions, which is one business day. All of Execution Access’ obligations under the clearing arrangement with Cantor Fitzgerald are guaranteed by NASDAQ OMX. Some of the non-FICC counterparties will be required to post collateral, provide principal letters, or provide other forms of credit enhancement to Execution Access for the purpose of mitigating counterparty risk.    We are exposed to credit risk through our clearing operations with NASDAQ OMX Nordic Clearing. See “Default Fund Contributions and Margin Deposits Received for Clearing Operations,” of “Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements,” above, as well as Note 14, “Clearing Operations” for further discussion.    We also have credit risk related to transaction and subscription-based revenues that are billed to customers on a monthly or quarterly basis, in arrears. Our potential exposure to credit losses on these transactions is represented by the receivable balances in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. On an ongoing basis, we review and evaluate changes in the status of our counterparties’ creditworthiness.   Credit losses such as those described above could adversely affect our condensed consolidated financial position and results of operations.   Item 4.Controls and Procedures.    (a) Disclosure controls and procedures. NASDAQ OMX’s management, with the participation of NASDAQ OMX’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President, Corporate Strategy, has evaluated the effectiveness of NASDAQ OMX’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”)) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, NASDAQ OMX’s      55     Table Of Contents   Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President, Corporate Strategy have concluded that, as of the end of such period, NASDAQ OMX’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective.    (b) Internal controls over financial reporting. There have been no changes in NASDAQ OMX’s internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and Rule 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended June 30, 2014 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, NASDAQ OMX’s internal controls over financial reporting.    PART II—OTHER INFORMATION   Item 1.Legal Proceedings.    As previously disclosed, we became a party to several legal and regulatory proceedings in 2012, 2013, and 2014 relating to the Facebook IPO that occurred on May 18, 2012. We believe that the legal actions filed against NASDAQ OMX are without merit and intend to defend them vigorously.    As described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012, we are named as a defendant in a consolidated matter captioned In re Facebook, Inc., IPO Securities and Derivative Litigation, MDL No. 2389 (S.D.N.Y.). Our appeal of the district court’s order granting in part and denying in part our motion to dismiss the consolidated amended complaint is currently pending in the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, at No. 14-1457.    In our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2013, we identified a demand for arbitration from a member organization seeking indemnification for alleged losses associated with the Facebook IPO. On June 18, 2013, the District Court for the Southern District of New York granted a preliminary injunction enjoining the arbitration, and the member organization has appealed the order granting the injunction to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals.    We also are named as one of many defendants in City of Providence v. BATS Global Markets, Inc., et al., 14 Civ. 2811 (S.D.N.Y.), which was filed on April 18, 2014 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The plaintiff has named as defendants sixteen national exchanges; fourteen of the largest brokerage firms in the United States; and twelve financial-services firms whose primary business allegedly is engaging in high-frequency trading. On behalf of a putative class of securities traders, the plaintiff alleges that the defendants engaged in a scheme to manipulate the markets through high-frequency trading; the complaint asserts claims against us under Section 10(b) of the Act and Rule 10b-5, as well as under Section 6(b) of the Act. The district court has appointed lead counsel, who have until September 2, 2014 either to file an amended complaint or to proceed with the initial complaint. Given the preliminary nature of the proceedings, we are unable to estimate what, if any, liability may result from this litigation. However, we believe the claims to be without merit and intend to litigate them vigorously.    In addition, we are named as one of many exchange defendants in Lanier v. BATS Exchange Inc., et al., 14 Civ. 3745 (S.D.N.Y.), Lanier v. BATS Exchange Inc., et al., 14 Civ. 3865 (S.D.N.Y.), and Lanier v. Bats Exchange Inc., 14 Civ. 3866 (S.D.N.Y.), which were filed between May 23, 2014 and May 30, 2014 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The plaintiff is the same in each of these cases, and the three complaints contain substantially similar allegations. On behalf of a putative class of subscribers for market data provided by national exchanges, the plaintiff alleges that the exchanges provided data more quickly to certain market participants than to others, supposedly in breach of the exchanges’ plans for dissemination of market data and subscriber agreements executed under those plans. The complaint asserts contractual theories under state law based on these alleged breaches. Given the preliminary nature of the proceedings, we are unable to estimate what, if any, liability may result from this litigation. However, we believe the claims to be without merit and intend to litigate them vigorously.    Except as disclosed above and in prior reports filed under the Act, we are not currently a party to any litigation or proceeding that we believe could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition, or operating results. However, from time to time, we have been threatened with, or named as a defendant in, lawsuits or involved in regulatory proceedings.    Item 1A.Risk Factors.    In addition to the other information set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, you should carefully consider the factors discussed under “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2013 as filed with the SEC on February 24, 2014 and our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2014, as filed with the SEC on May 9, 2013. These risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The risks and uncertainties in our Form 10-K and Form 10-Q are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business.   Item 2.Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.
