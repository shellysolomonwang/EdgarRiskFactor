Item 1A. Risk Factors  The following risk factors have changed materially since they were described in our 2007 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed February 29, 2008:  We rely exclusively on independent insurance agents to distribute our products.  We market our products through independent, non-exclusive insurance agents. These agents are not obligated to promote our products and can and do sell our competitors’ products. We must offer insurance products that meet the needs of these agencies and their clients. We need to maintain good relationships with the agencies that market our products. If we do not, these agencies may market our competitors’ products instead of ours, which may lead to us having a less desirable mix of business and could affect our results of operations.  Events or conditions that could diminish our agents’ desire to produce business for us and the competitive advantage that our independent agencies enjoy:     •   Downgrade of the financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries. We believe our strong insurer financial strength ratings, in particular the A++ (Superior) rating from A.M. Best for our standard market property casualty insurance subsidiaries, are an important competitive advantage. Only 16 other insurance groups, or 1.6 percent of all rated insurance groups, qualify for the A++, A.M. Best’s highest rating. If our property casualty ratings are downgraded by multiple notches, our agents might find it more difficult to market our products or might choose to emphasize the products of other carriers. See Part 1, Item 2, Measuring our Success in 2008 and Beyond, Page 18, for additional discussion of our financial strength ratings.      •   Concerns that doing business with us is difficult, perceptions that our level of service is no longer a distinguishing characteristic in the marketplace or perceptions that our business practices are not compatible with agents’ business models. This could occur if agents or policyholders believe that we are no longer providing the prompt, reliable personal service that has long been a distinguishing characteristic of our insurance operations.      •   Delays in the development, implementation, performance and benefits of technology projects and enhancements or independent agent perceptions that our technology solutions are inadequate to match their needs. A reduction in the number of independent agencies marketing our products, the failure of agencies to successfully market our products or the choice of agencies to reduce their writings of our products could affect                            Cincinnati Financial Corporation   44    Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2008          Table of Contents  our results of operations if we are unable to replace them with agencies that produce adequate and profitable premiums.  Further, policyholders may choose a competitor’s product rather than our own because of real or perceived differences in price, terms and conditions, coverage or service. If the quality of the independent agencies with which we do business were to decline, that also might cause policyholders to purchase their insurance through different agencies or channels. Consumers, especially in the personal insurance segments, may increasingly choose to purchase insurance from distribution channels other than independent insurance agents, such as direct marketers.  Please see our 2007 Annual Report on Form 10-K, Item 1, Our Business and Our Strategy, Page 1, for a discussion of our relationships with independent insurance agents.  We could experience an unusually high level of losses due to catastrophic or terrorism events or risk concentrations.  In the normal course of our business, we provide coverage against perils for which estimates of losses are highly uncertain, in particular catastrophic and terrorism events. Catastrophes can be caused by a number of events, including hurricanes, tornadoes, windstorms, earthquakes, hailstorms, explosions, severe winter weather and fires. Due to the nature of these events, we are unable to predict precisely the frequency or potential cost of catastrophe occurrences. The extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the total amount of insured exposure in the area affected by the event and the severity of the event.  We have natural catastrophe exposure to:     •   Hurricanes in the gulf and southeastern coastal regions.      •   Earthquakes in the New Madrid fault zone, which lies within the central Mississippi valley, extending from northeast Arkansas through southeast Missouri, western Tennessee and western Kentucky to southern Illinois, southern Indiana and parts of Ohio.      •   Tornado, wind and hail in the Midwest and Southeast and, to a certain extent, the mid-Atlantic.    The occurrence of terrorist attacks in the geographic areas we serve could result in substantially higher claims under our insurance policies than we have anticipated. While we do insure terrorism risk in all areas we serve, we have identified our major terrorism exposure as general commercial risks in the metropolitan Chicago area as well as small co-op utilities, small shopping malls and small colleges throughout our 34 active states. Additionally, our life insurance subsidiary could be adversely affected in the event of a terrorist event or an epidemic such as the avian flu, particularly if the epidemic were to affect a broad range of the population beyond just the very young or the very old. Our associate health plan is self-funded and could similarly be affected.  Our results of operations would be adversely affected if the level of losses we experienced over a period of time exceeded our actuarially determined expectations. In addition, our financial condition would be adversely affected if we were required to sell securities prior to maturity or at unfavorable prices to pay an unusually high level of loss and loss expenses. Securities pricing might be even less favorable if a number of insurance companies needed to sell securities during a short period of time because of unusually high losses from catastrophic events.  Our geographic concentration ties our performance to business, economic, environmental and regulatory conditions in certain states. We market our property casualty insurance products in 34 states, but our business is concentrated in the Midwest and Southeast. We also have exposure in states where we do not actively market insurance when clients of our independent agencies have businesses or properties in multiple states.  The Cincinnati Insurance Company also participates in three assumed reinsurance treaties with two reinsurers that spread the risk of very high catastrophe losses among many insurers. In 2008, we have exposure of up to $7 million of assumed losses in three layers, from $1.0 billion to $1.7 billion, from a single event under an assumed reinsurance treaty for Munich Re Group. The other two assumed reinsurance treaties are immaterial.  In the event of a severe catastrophic event or terrorist attack elsewhere in the world, our insurance losses may be immaterial. However, the companies in which we invest might be severely affected, which could affect our financial condition and results of operations. Our reinsurers might experience significant losses, potentially jeopardizing their ability to pay losses we cede to them. A catastrophe or epidemic event also could affect our operations by damaging our headquarters facility or disrupting our associates’ ability to perform their assigned tasks.  Our overall results could be affected if a significant portion of our commercial lines policyholders, including those purchasing surety bonds, are adversely affected by marked or prolonged economic downturns and events such as a downturn in construction and related sectors, tightening credit markets, and higher fuel costs. Such events could make it more difficult for policyholders to finance new projects, complete projects or expand their businesses, leading to lower premiums from reduced payrolls and sales and lower purchases of                     Cincinnati Financial Corporation       Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2008    45          Table of Contents  equipment and vehicles. These events could also cause claims, including surety claims, to increase due to a policyholder’s inability to secure necessary financing to complete projects. Such economic downturns and events could have a greater impact in the construction sector where we have a concentration of risks and in geographic areas that are hardest hit by economic downturns.  Our ability to realize our investment objectives could affect our financial condition, our results of operations or our cash flows.  We invest premiums received from policyholders and other available cash to generate investment income and capital appreciation, maintaining sufficient liquidity to pay covered claims and operating expenses, service our debt obligations and pay dividends. At June 30, 2008, our investment portfolio was $10.379 billion, or 70.0 percent, of our total assets.  Investment income is an important component of our revenues and net income. The ability to achieve our investment objectives is affected by factors that are beyond our control, such as inflation, economic growth, interest rates, world political conditions, terrorism attacks or threats, adverse events affecting other companies in our industry or the industries in which we invest, market events leading to credit constriction and other widespread unpredictable events. These events may adversely affect the economy generally and could cause our investment income or the value of securities we own to decrease. A significant decline in our investment income could have an adverse effect on our net income, and thereby on our shareholders’ equity and our policyholders’ surplus. For more detailed discussion of risks associated with our investments, please refer to Item 3, Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures About Market Risk, Page 38.  Our investment performance also could suffer because of the types or concentrations of investments, industry groups and/or individual securities in which we choose to invest. Market value changes related to these choices could cause a material change in our financial condition or results of operations.  For the six months ended June 30, 2008, common stock holdings made up 21.2 percent of our investment portfolio. Of those equities, 41.4 percent were in financial sector companies. Adverse news or events affecting the equity markets, and this sector specifically, such as unfavorable developments related to housing and credit, could affect our net income, book value and overall results as well as our ability to pay our common stock dividend. See Item 2, Investments Results of Operations, Page 32, and Item 3, Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures About Market Risk, Page 38, for discussion of our investment activities including sales of equity securities that reduced our financial sector concentration.
