Item 1A. Risk Factors.  The following supplements the discussion of risk factors affecting the Company as set forth under “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of the Form 10-K and “Risk Factors” in Part II, Item 1A of the Second Quarter Form 10-Q.  The financial services industry is subject to extensive regulation, which is undergoing major changes that will impact our business.  Like other major financial services firms, we are subject to extensive regulation by U.S. federal and state regulatory agencies and securities exchanges and by regulators and exchanges in each of the major markets where we operate, and face the risk of investigations and proceedings by governmental and self-regulatory agencies in all countries in which we conduct our business. Interventions by authorities may result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions or other relief. In addition to the monetary consequences, these measures could, for example, impact our ability to engage in, or impose limitations on, certain of our businesses. The number of these investigations and proceedings, as well as the amount of penalties and fines sought, has increased substantially in recent years with regard to many firms in the financial services industry, including us. Significant regulatory action against us could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations or cause us significant reputational harm, which could seriously harm our business. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) also provides a bounty to whistleblowers who present the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) with information related to securities laws violations that leads to a successful enforcement action. As a result of this bounty, we may face an increased number of investigations by the SEC.  In response to the financial crisis, legislators and regulators, both in the U.S. and worldwide, have adopted, or are currently considering enacting, financial market reforms that have resulted and could result in major changes to the way our global operations are regulated. In particular, as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act, we are subject to significantly revised and expanded regulation and supervision, to more intensive scrutiny of our businesses and any plans for expansion of those businesses, to new activities limitations, to a systemic risk regime which will impose especially high capital and liquidity requirements, and to comprehensive new derivatives regulation. Certain portions of the Dodd-Frank Act were effective immediately, while other portions will be effective only following rulemaking and extended transition periods, but many of these changes could in the future materially impact the profitability of our businesses, the value of assets we hold, expose us to additional costs, require changes to business practices or force us to discontinue businesses, could adversely affect our ability to pay dividends, or could require us to raise capital, including in ways that may adversely impact our shareholders or creditors. While there continues to be uncertainty about the exact impact of these changes, we do know that the Company will be subject to a more complex regulatory framework, and will incur costs to comply with new requirements as well as to monitor for compliance in the future.  For example, the Volcker Rule provision of the Dodd-Frank Act will have an impact on us, including potentially limiting various aspects of our business. With respect to the “proprietary trading” prohibition of the Volcker Rule, we have previously announced plans to dispose of our in-house proprietary quantitative trading unit, Process-Driven Trading (“PDT”), in 2012. For the year ended December 31, 2010, PDT did not have a material                 157      Table of Contents  impact on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. We have also previously exited other standalone proprietary trading businesses (defined as those businesses that were dedicated solely to investing our capital), and we are continuing to liquidate legacy positions related to those businesses. In October 2011, four of the five agencies with authority for rulemaking issued proposed rules to implement the Volcker Rule. The rules set forth a complex and burdensome compliance, reporting and monitoring program, and seek comments to numerous questions. Comments are due in January 2012, and a final rule will not be published until some time after that date. The proposed rules currently require a compliance date of July 2012. Even with the publication of proposed rules, however, it is still too early to determine any additional limitations on the Company beyond the restriction on standalone proprietary trading. There remains considerable uncertainty about the interpretation of the proposed rules, and we are also unable to predict what the final version of the rules will be or the impact they may have on our businesses. We are closely monitoring regulatory developments related to the Volcker Rule, and when the regulations are final, we will be in a position to complete a review of our relevant activities and make plans to implement compliance with the Volcker Rule.
