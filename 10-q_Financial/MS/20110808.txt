Item 1A. Risk Factors.  Concerns regarding downgrade of the U.S. credit rating and the sovereign debt crisis in Europe could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and liquidity.  On August 5, 2011, Standard & Poor’s lowered its long term sovereign credit rating on the United States of America from AAA to AA+. While U.S. lawmakers reached agreement to raise the federal debt ceiling on August 2, 2011, the downgrade reflected Standard & Poor’s view that the fiscal consolidation plan within that agreement fell short of what would be necessary to stabilize the U.S. government’s medium term debt dynamics. This downgrade could have material adverse impacts on financial markets and economic conditions in the United               151        Table of Contents  States and throughout the world and, in turn, the market’s anticipation of these impacts could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and liquidity. In particular, it could disrupt payment systems, money markets, long-term or short-term fixed income markets, foreign exchange markets, commodities markets and equity markets and adversely affect the cost and availability of funding and certain impacts, such as increased spreads in money market and other short term rates, have been experienced already as the market anticipated the downgrade. In addition, it could adversely affect our credit ratings, as well as those of our clients and/or counterparties and could require us to post additional collateral on loans collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities. Because of the unprecedented nature of negative credit rating actions with respect to U.S. government obligations, the ultimate impacts on global markets and our business, financial condition and liquidity are unpredictable and may not be immediately apparent.  In addition, global markets and economic conditions have been negatively impacted by the ability of certain European Union (“EU”) member states to service their sovereign debt obligations. The continued uncertainty over the outcome of the EU governments’ financial support programs and the possibility that other EU member states may experience similar financial troubles could further disrupt global markets. In particular, it has and could in the future disrupt equity markets and result in volatile bond yields on the sovereign debt of EU members. These factors could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and liquidity. In particular, in connection with certain of our Institutional Securities business segment activities, we have exposure to European peripheral countries, which are defined as exposures in Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain. At June 30, 2011, gross funded exposure before the benefit of hedges to European peripheral countries was approximately $5 billion and net funded exposure after hedges was approximately $2 billion. Gross funded exposure includes obligations from sovereign governments, corporations, and financial institutions. In addition to the gross funded exposure, at June 30, 2011, the Company had European peripheral country exposure for overnight deposits with banks of approximately $2 billion and unfunded loans to corporations of approximately $1.5 billion.  The financial services industry is subject to extensive regulation, which is undergoing major changes that will impact our business.  As a major financial services firm, we are subject to extensive regulation by U.S. federal and state regulatory agencies and securities exchanges and by regulators and exchanges in each of the major markets where we operate. We also face the risk of investigations and proceedings by governmental and self-regulatory agencies in all countries in which we conduct our business. Interventions by authorities may result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions or other relief. In addition to the monetary consequences, these measures could, for example, impact our ability to engage in, or impose limitations on, certain of our businesses. The number of these investigations and proceedings, as well as the amount of penalties and fines sought, has increased substantially in recent years with regard to many firms in the financial services industry, including us. Significant regulatory action against us could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations or cause us significant reputational harm, which could seriously harm our business. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) also provides a bounty to whistleblowers who present the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) with information related to securities laws violations that leads to a successful enforcement action. As a result of this bounty, we may face an increased number of investigations by the SEC.  In response to the financial crisis, legislators and regulators, both in the U.S. and worldwide, have adopted, or are currently considering enacting, financial market reforms that have resulted and could result in major changes to the way our global operations are regulated. In particular, as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act, we are subject to significantly revised and expanded regulation and supervision, to new activities limitations, to a systemic risk regime which will impose especially high capital and liquidity requirements, and to comprehensive new derivatives regulation. Additional restrictions on our activities would result if we were to no longer meet certain capital or management requirements at the financial holding company level. Certain portions of the Dodd-Frank Act were effective immediately, while other portions will be effective only following extended transition periods, but many of these changes could in the future materially impact the profitability of our businesses, the value of assets we hold, expose us to additional costs, require changes to business practices or force us to discontinue                 152      Table of Contents  businesses, could adversely affect our ability to pay dividends, or could require us to raise capital, including in ways that may adversely impact our shareholders or creditors.  For example, the Volcker Rule provision of the Dodd-Frank Act will have an impact on us, including potentially limiting various aspects of our business. With respect to the “proprietary trading” prohibition of the Volcker Rule, we have previously announced plans to dispose of our in-house proprietary quantitative trading unit, Process-Driven Trading (“PDT”), in 2012. For the year ended December 31, 2010, PDT did not have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. We have also previously exited other standalone proprietary trading businesses (defined as those businesses that were dedicated solely to investing our capital), and we are continuing to liquidate legacy positions related to those businesses. Beyond the restriction on standalone proprietary trading businesses, any additional limitations will depend on the details of agency rulemaking, which have not been published. Given the lack of clarity, we are unable to identify which other parts of our business will or might be defined to be “proprietary trading” or, even if defined as “proprietary trading,” whether we would benefit from a “permitted activity” exception, such as market-making or hedging. We are closely monitoring regulatory developments related to the Volcker Rule, and when the regulations are final, we will be in a position to complete a review of our relevant activities and make plans to implement compliance with the Volcker Rule, which will likely not require full conformance until July 2014, subject to extensions. Holding large and concentrated positions may expose us to losses.  Concentration of risk may reduce revenues or result in losses in our market-making, investing, block trading, underwriting and lending businesses in the event of unfavorable market movements. We commit substantial amounts of capital to these businesses, which often results in our taking large positions in the securities of, or making large loans to, a particular issuer or issuers in a particular industry, country or region. For example, our exposure to monoline insurers (“Monolines”) at June 30, 2011 includes $1.7 billion of bonds that are insured by Monolines and $1.6 billion of positive net derivative counterparty exposure (principally MBIA Insurance Corporation). Our hedging program for Monoline counterparty exposure continues to become more costly and difficult to effect because of the basis risk (risk associated with imperfect hedging) between the Monoline counterparty exposure and the related hedges. The quarter and six months ended June 30, 2011 included gains of $471 million and $153 million, respectively, compared with losses of $186 million and $330 million, respectively, in the prior year comparative periods. Although we proactively manage our Monoline exposure, as market conditions continue to evolve, significant additional gains or losses could be incurred. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Executive Summary—Significant Items—Monoline Insurers” in Part I, Item 2, herein.  Our borrowing costs and access to the debt capital markets depend significantly on our credit ratings.    The cost and availability of unsecured financing generally are dependent on our short-term and long-term credit ratings. Factors that are important to the determination of our credit ratings include the level and quality of our earnings, capital adequacy, liquidity, risk appetite and management, asset quality, business mix and actual and perceived levels of government support.  Our debt ratings also can have a significant impact on certain trading revenues, particularly in those businesses where longer term counterparty performance is critical, such as over-the-counter (“OTC”) derivative transactions, including credit derivatives and interest rate swaps. In connection with certain OTC trading agreements and certain other agreements associated with the Institutional Securities business segment, we may be required to provide additional collateral to certain counterparties in the event of a credit ratings downgrade. At June 30, 2011, the amount of additional collateral or termination payments that could be called by counterparties under the terms of such agreements in the event of a one-notch downgrade of our long-term credit rating was $1,245 million. A total of $3,258 million in collateral or termination payments could be called in the event of a two-notch downgrade. In addition, we may be required to pledge additional collateral to certain exchanges and               153        Table of Contents  clearing organizations in the event of a credit ratings downgrade. At June 30, 2011, the increased collateral requirement at certain exchanges and clearing organizations was $178 million in the event of a one-notch downgrade of our long-term credit rating. A total of $1,371 million of collateral is required in the event of a two-notch downgrade.  The rating agencies are considering the impact of the Dodd-Frank Act’s resolution authority provisions on large banking institutions and it is possible that they could downgrade our ratings and those of similar institutions.  We have incurred, and may continue to incur, significant losses in the real estate sector.  We finance and acquire principal positions in a number of real estate and real estate-related products for our own account, for investment vehicles managed by affiliates in which we also may have a significant investment, for separate accounts managed by affiliates and for major participants in the commercial and residential real estate markets. At June 30, 2011, the condensed consolidated statements of financial condition included amounts representing real estate investment assets of consolidated subsidiaries of approximately $2.0 billion, net of noncontrolling interests of approximately $1.6 billion. In addition, we had contractual capital commitments, guarantees, lending facilities and counterparty arrangements with respect to real estate investments of $1.0 billion at June 30, 2011.  We also originate loans secured by commercial and residential properties. Further, we securitize and trade in a wide range of commercial and residential real estate and real estate-related whole loans, mortgages and other real estate and commercial assets and products, including residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities. These businesses have been, and may continue to be, adversely affected by the downturn in the real estate sector. In connection with these activities, we have provided, or otherwise agreed to be responsible for, certain representations and warranties. Under certain circumstances, we may be required to repurchase such assets or make other payments related to such assets if such representations and warranties were breached. Between 2004 and June 30, 2011, we sponsored approximately $147 billion of residential mortgage-backed securities (“RMBS”) primarily containing U.S. residential loans. Of that amount, we made representations and warranties concerning approximately $46 billion of loans and agreed to be responsible for the representations and warranties made by third-party sellers, many of which are now insolvent, on approximately $21 billion of loans. At June 30, 2011, the current unpaid principal balance (“UPB”) for all the residential assets subject to such representations and warranties was approximately $25.1 billion and the cumulative losses associated with U.S. RMBS were approximately $9.6 billion. We did not make, or otherwise agree to be responsible, for the representations and warranties made by third party sellers on approximately $80 billion of residential loans that we securitized during that time period. We have not sponsored any U.S. RMBS transactions since 2007.  We have also made representations and warranties in connection with our role as an originator of certain commercial mortgage loans that we securitized in commercial mortgage-backed securities (“CMBS”). Between 2004 and 2010, we originated approximately $43 billion and $29 billion of U.S. and non-U.S. commercial mortgage loans, respectively, that were placed into CMBS sponsored by us. At June 30, 2011, the current UPB for all U.S. commercial mortgage loans subject to such representations and warranties was $36.6 billion. At June 30, 2011, the current UPB for all non-U.S. commercial mortgage loans, subject to such representations and warranties was approximately $17 billion.  Recently, the level of litigation activity focused on residential mortgage and credit crisis-related matters has increased materially in the financial services industry. As a result, we expect that we may become the subject of increased claims for damages and other relief regarding residential mortgages and related securities in the future. We continue to monitor our real estate-related activities in order to manage our exposures and potential liability from these markets and businesses. See “Legal Proceedings—Residential Mortgage and Credit Crisis Related Matters” in Part II, Item 1 herein. For a discussion of additional risk factors affecting the Company, see also “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of the Form 10-K.                 154      Table of Contents We may be unable to fully capture the expected value from acquisitions, joint ventures, minority stakes and strategic alliances.  In connection with past or future acquisitions, joint ventures (including Morgan Stanley Smith Barney Holdings LLC) or strategic alliances (including with Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Inc. (“MUFG”)), we face numerous risks and uncertainties combining or integrating the relevant businesses and systems, including the need to combine accounting and data processing systems and management controls and to integrate relationships with clients, trading counterparties and business partners. In the case of joint ventures and minority stakes, we are subject to additional risks and uncertainties because we may be dependent upon, and subject to liability, losses or reputational damage relating to, systems, controls and personnel that are not under our control.  For example, the ownership arrangements relating to the Company’s joint venture in Japan with MUFG of their respective investment banking and securities businesses are complex. MUFG and the Company have integrated their respective Japanese securities businesses by forming two joint venture companies, Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities Co., Ltd. (“MUMSS”) and Morgan Stanley MUFG Securities, Co., Ltd. (“MSMS”). See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Other Matters—Japanese Securities Joint Venture” in Part I, Item 2 herein. For the quarter ended March 31, 2011, the Company recorded a loss of $655 million arising from its 40% stake in MUMSS related to certain fixed income trading positions at MUMSS, which is a subsidiary of MUFG that is controlled and risk managed by MUFG. As a result of this loss, during the quarter ended March 31, 2011, the Company entered into a transaction with MUMSS, whereby the fixed income trading positions that previously caused the majority of the aforementioned MUMSS losses were transferred to MSMS, a subsidiary of the Company that is controlled and risk managed by the Company. While MUFG contributed $370 million in capital to MUMSS in connection with the trading losses and has or will take certain other actions, including the replacement of certain management personnel and enhancement of risk management processes and controls, additional losses could be incurred by MUMSS in the future.  In addition, conflicts or disagreements between us and any of our joint venture partners may negatively impact the benefits to be achieved by the relevant joint venture.  There is no assurance that any of our acquisitions will be successfully integrated or yield all of the positive benefits anticipated. If we are not able to integrate successfully our past and future acquisitions, there is a risk that our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows may be materially and adversely affected.  Certain of our business initiatives, including expansions of existing businesses, may bring us into contact, directly or indirectly, with individuals and entities that are not within our traditional client and counterparty base and may expose us to new asset classes and new markets. These business activities expose us to new and enhanced risks, greater regulatory scrutiny of these activities, increased credit-related, sovereign and operational risks, and reputational concerns regarding the manner in which these assets are being operated or held.
