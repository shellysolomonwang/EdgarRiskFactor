Item 1A. Risk Factors.  For a discussion of the risk factors affecting the Company, see “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of the Form 10-K. In connection with the Company’s status as a federal bank holding company, certain additional risks and uncertainties should also be considered as discussed below.  Our liquidity and financial condition have been and could continue to be adversely affected by U.S. and international markets and economic conditions.  Liquidity is essential to our business. Our ability to raise funding in the long-term or short-term debt capital markets or the equity markets, or to access secured lending markets, has been and could continue to be adversely affected by conditions in the U.S. and international markets and economy. As described in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Global Market and Economic Conditions in the Quarter and Nine Month Period Ended August 31, 2008,” Global market and economic conditions have been, and continue to be, disrupted and volatile, and in recent weeks the volatility has reached unprecedented levels. In particular, our cost and availability of funding have been and may continue to be adversely affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads. As a result of concern about the stability of the markets generally and the strength of counterparties specifically, many lenders and institutional investors have reduced and, in some cases, ceased to provide funding to borrowers. We have already fulfilled our planned financing needs for 2008; however, to the extent we are not able to access the debt markets on acceptable terms in the future, we may increase our use of deposit funding and other funding sources generally available to a financial holding company, and/or may seek to raise funding and capital through equity issuance. Continued turbulence in the U.S. and international markets and economy may adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition and the willingness of certain counterparties and customers to do business with us. For additional information on factors that may affect our liquidity and financial condition, see “Liquidity is essential to our businesses and we rely on external sources to finance a significant portion of our operations” and “Our borrowing costs and access to the debt capital markets depend significantly on our credit ratings” in Part I, Item 1A of the Form 10-K.               114        Table of Contents Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by new regulations to which we are and will become subject as a result of becoming a bank holding company, by new regulations or by changes in other regulations or the application thereof.  On September 21, 2008, we obtained approval from the Fed to become a bank holding company. Although we have a statutory grace period of two years, with the possibility of three one-year extensions for a total grace period of five years, to conform existing activities and investments to the restrictions on nonbanking activities that apply to financial holding companies and although we expect to be able to continue to engage in most of the activities in which we currently engage after such time, it is possible that certain of our existing activities will not be deemed to be permissible under applicable regulations. In addition, as a financial holding company, we are subject to the comprehensive, consolidated supervision and regulation of the Fed, including risk-based and leverage capital requirements and information reporting requirements, and Morgan Stanley Bank, N.A. will be subject to the functional supervision and regulation of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.  The financial services industry, in general, is heavily regulated. Proposals for legislation further regulating the financial services industry are continually being introduced in the United States Congress and in state legislatures. The agencies regulating the financial services industry also periodically adopt changes to their regulations. In light of current conditions in the U.S. financial markets and economy, regulators have increased their focus on the regulation of the financial services industry. We are unable to predict whether any of these proposals will be implemented or in what form, or whether any additional or similar changes to statutes or regulations, including the interpretation or implementation thereof, will occur in the future. Any such action could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways and could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  We are also affected by the policies adopted by regulatory authorities and bodies of the United States and other governments. For example, the actions of the Fed and international central banking authorities directly impact our cost of funds for lending, capital raising and investment activities and may impact the value of financial instruments we hold. In addition, such changes in monetary policy may affect the credit quality of our customers. Changes in domestic and international monetary policy are beyond our control and difficult to predict.                115       Table of Contents   Item 2.
