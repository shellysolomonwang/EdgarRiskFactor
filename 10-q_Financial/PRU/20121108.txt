ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS    You should carefully consider the risks described under “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011 (“2011 Form 10-K”). These risks could materially affect our business, results of operations or financial condition, cause the trading price of our Common Stock to decline materially or cause our actual results to differ materially from those expected or those expressed in any forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the Company. These risks are not exclusive, and additional risks to which we are subject include, but are not limited to, the factors mentioned under “Forward-Looking Statements” above and the risks of our businesses described elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.    The risk factor contained in our 2011 Form 10-K titled “The enactment of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act will subject us to substantial additional federal regulation and we cannot predict the effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition” is hereby updated to note that on October 19, 2012, Prudential Financial received notice that it is under consideration by the Financial Stability Oversight Council for designation as a non-bank financial company to be subject to stricter prudential regulatory standards and supervision by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act. For additional information on this notice of consideration by the Financial Stability Oversight Council, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Executive Summary.”    296    Table of Contents   ITEM 2.
