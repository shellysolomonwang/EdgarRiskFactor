ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS    The following should be read in conjunction with and supplements and amends the section titled “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009. These risks could materially affect our business, results of operations or financial condition, cause the trading price of our Common Stock to decline materially or cause our actual results to differ materially from those expected or those expressed in any forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the Company. These risks are not exclusive, and additional risks to which we are subject include, but are not limited to, the factors mentioned under “Forward-Looking Statements” above and the risks of our businesses described elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.    The enactment of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act will subject us to substantial additional federal regulation and we cannot predict the effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.    On July 21, 2010, President Obama signed into law the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank”), which effects comprehensive changes to the regulation of financial services in the United States and will subject us to substantial additional federal regulation. Dodd-Frank directs existing and newly-created government agencies and bodies to promulgate regulations implementing the law, a process anticipated to occur over the next few years. We cannot predict with any certainty the requirements of the regulations ultimately adopted or how Dodd-Frank and such regulations will affect the financial markets generally, impact our business, credit or financial strength ratings, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition or advise or require us to raise additional capital.    Key aspects we have identified to date of Dodd-Frank’s potential impact on us include:        •    Prudential Financial will become subject, as a savings and loan holding company, to the examination, enforcement and supervisory authority of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (“FRB”) after the transfer to the FRB of the existing authority of the Office of Thrift Supervision (expected to occur within a year of Dodd-Frank’s enactment). The FRB will have authority to impose capital requirements on the Company after the transfer date. Pursuant to the “Collins Amendment” included in Dodd-Frank, the FRB must establish minimum leverage and risk-based capital requirements for savings and loan holding companies (including Prudential Financial) and other institutions that are not less than those applicable to insured depository institutions. These requirements will become generally applicable to Prudential Financial five years after Dodd-Frank’s enactment except, for purposes of calculating Tier 1 capital, new issuances of debt and equity capital will be immediately subject to the requirements. We cannot predict what capital regulations the FRB will promulgate under these authorizations, either generally or as applicable to insurance-based organizations. We cannot predict how the FRB will exercise general supervisory authority over us as to the Company’s business practices.        •    Dodd-Frank establishes a Financial Stability Oversight Council (“Council”) which is authorized to subject non-bank financial companies such as Prudential Financial to stricter prudential standards (a “Designated Financial Company”) if the Council determines that material financial distress at the    254    Table of Contents       company or the scope of the company’s activities could pose a threat to financial stability of the U.S. If so designated, we would become subject to unspecified stricter prudential standards, including stricter requirements and limitations relating to risk-based capital, leverage, liquidity and credit exposure, as well as overall risk management requirements, management interlock prohibitions and a requirement to maintain a plan for rapid and orderly dissolution in the event of severe financial distress. The “Collins Amendment” capital requirements referred to above would apply when adopted by the FRB (i.e., the 5-year grandfathering would no longer be available). The FRB could also require the issuance of capital securities automatically convertible to equity in the event of financial distress, require enhanced public disclosures to support market evaluation of risk profile and impose short-term debt limits. If Prudential Financial or a subsidiary were so designated, failure to meet defined measures of financial condition could result in: limits on capital distributions, acquisitions and/or asset growth; requirements for a capital restoration plan and capital raising, limitations on transactions with affiliates, management changes and asset sales; and, if the FRB and the Council determined Prudential Financial (or the designated subsidiary) posed a grave threat to the financial stability of the U.S., further limits on acquisitions or combinations, restrictions on product offerings and/or requirements to sell assets. We cannot predict whether Prudential Financial or a subsidiary will be designated as a Designated Financial Company.        •    We will become, as a savings and loan holding company (and if designated, as a Designated Financial Company), subject to stress tests to be promulgated by the FRB in consultation with the newly-created Federal Insurance Office (discussed below) to determine whether, on a consolidated basis, we have the capital necessary to absorb losses as a result of adverse economic conditions. We cannot predict how the stress tests will be designed or conducted or whether the results thereof will cause us to alter our business practices or affect the perceptions of regulators, rating agencies, customers, counterparties or investors of our financial strength.        •    The Council may recommend that state insurance regulators or other regulators apply new or heightened standards and safeguards for activities or practices we and other insurers or other financial services companies engage in that could create or increase the risk that significant liquidity, credit or other problems spread among financial companies. We cannot predict whether any such recommendations will be made or their effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.        •    As a savings and loan holding company, we will become subject to the “Volcker Rule” provisions of Dodd-Frank prohibiting, subject to the rule’s exceptions, “proprietary trading” and the sponsorship of, and investment in, funds (referred to in Dodd-Frank as hedge funds or private equity funds) that rely on certain exemptions from the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (collectively, “covered funds”). The Council is to provide recommendations on the implementation of the Volcker Rule within six months of Dodd-Frank’s enactment, and the FRB is to promulgate regulations thereunder within nine months thereafter, and substantial uncertainty as to the rule’s application to our business may exist over this period. The rule becomes effective on the earlier of one year after adoption of regulations or two years after Dodd-Frank’s enactment, and activities and investments must be brought into compliance within two years thereafter, subject to exceptions. We presently believe that the “permitted activities” exceptions to the rule should be interpreted in a manner that does not require our insurance subsidiaries (including our foreign insurance subsidiaries) to materially alter their securities trading or investing practices, but there can be no assurance that the regulations promulgated will so provide. If the Volcker Rule were interpreted to prohibit insurance company investments in covered funds, or to apply the aggregate limit of 3% of Tier 1 capital to our coinvestment in covered funds sponsored by our Prudential Real Estate Investors (PREI), Prudential Investment Management (PIM) or other operations, our insurance subsidiaries could be required to dispose of covered fund investments. Furthermore, our PREI and PIM investment management operations sponsor covered funds in which we coinvest (in both insurance and non-insurance subsidiaries) which are directly affected by the Volcker Rule prohibitions which, among other things, limit permanent investment by a sponsoring company in any one fund to no more than 3% of fund capital, limit covered fund marketing except to bona fide trust, fiduciary or investment advisory customers, prohibit covered transactions between a    255    Table of Contents       fund and the sponsoring company and prohibit the use of the sponsoring company’s name in the fund’s name. It is possible that regulations with respect to the foregoing provisions could require us to dispose of covered fund investments, significantly alter our business practices in these operations and/or diminish the attractiveness of our covered fund products to clients. If we were a Designated Financial Company but not a savings and loan holding company, the foregoing prohibitions would not apply but we would be subject, pursuant to future FRB rulemaking, to additional capital requirements for, and quantitative limits on, proprietary trading and ownership of covered funds. In addition, actions taken by other financial entities in response to the Volcker Rule could potentially negatively affect the market for, returns from or liquidity of our investments in covered funds affiliated with such other financial entities.        •    Dodd-Frank creates a new framework for regulation of the over-the-counter (“OTC”) derivatives markets which could impact various activities of Prudential Global Funding (“PGF”), Prudential Financial and our insurance subsidiaries, which use derivatives for various purposes (including hedging interest rate, foreign currency and equity market exposures). Dodd-Frank generally requires swaps, subject to a determination by the CFTC or SEC as to which swaps are covered, with all counterparties except non-financial end users to be executed through a centralized exchange or regulated facility and to be cleared through a regulated clearinghouse. Swap dealers and major swap participants (“MSPs”) are subject to capital and margin (i.e., collateral) requirements that will be imposed by the applicable prudential regulator or the CFTC or SEC, as well as business conduct rules and reporting requirements. While we believe Prudential Financial and PGF should not be considered dealers or MSPs subject to the capital and margin requirements, the final regulations adopted could provide otherwise, which could substantially increase the cost of hedging and the related operations. A determination by the Secretary of the Treasury not to exclude foreign currency swaps and forwards from the foregoing requirements also could have that result. PGF intermediates swaps between Prudential entities (other than PFI) and third parties, and it is possible that PGF’s standardized intra-Company transactions might be required to be executed through an exchange, clear centrally and post margin, potentially defeating PGF’s key function; if so, Prudential entities might directly enter into swaps with third parties, potentially increasing the economic costs of hedging. The SEC and CFTC are required to determine whether and how “stable value contracts” should be treated as swaps and, although we believe otherwise, various other products offered by our insurance subsidiaries might be treated as swaps; if regulated as swaps, we cannot predict how the rules would be applied to such products or the effect on their profitability or attractiveness to our clients. Finally, the new regulatory scheme imposed on all market participants may increase the costs of hedging generally and banking institutions (with which we enter into a substantial portion of our derivatives) may be required to conduct at least a portion of their OTC derivatives businesses outside their depositary institutions. The affiliates through which these institutions will conduct their OTC derivatives businesses might be less creditworthy than the depository institutions themselves, and “netting” of counterparty exposures with non-banks will not be allowed, potentially affecting the credit risk these counterparties pose to us and the degree to which we are able to enter into transactions with these counterparties. We cannot predict the effect of the foregoing on our hedging costs, our hedging strategy or implementation thereof or whether we will need or choose to increase and/or change the composition of the risks we do not hedge.        •    Dodd-Frank establishes a Federal Insurance Office within the Department of the Treasury to be headed by a director appointed by the Secretary of the Treasury. While not having a general supervisory or regulatory authority over the business of insurance, the director of this office will perform various functions with respect to insurance (other than health insurance), including serving as a non-voting member of the Council and making recommendations to the Council regarding insurers (potentially including the Company) to be designated for stricter regulation. The director is also required to conduct a study on how to modernize and improve the system of insurance regulation in the United States, including by increased national uniformity through either a federal charter or effective action by the states.        •    Dodd-Frank authorizes the FRB to require a savings and loan holding company or a Designated Financial Company to place its financial activities in an intermediate holding company separate from    256    Table of Contents       non-financial activities (as defined for purposes of the Bank Holding Company Act) and imposes restrictions on transactions between the two businesses. While our non-financial activities are relatively minor, the imposition of such a requirement on us could be burdensome and costly to implement. Dodd-Frank directs the U.S. Government Accountability Office to study and report to Congressional committees within eighteen months of Dodd-Frank’s enactment regarding the adequacy of the federal regulatory framework which permits savings and loan holding companies to engage in non-financial activities and the consequence of prohibiting such activities.        •    Title II of Dodd-Frank provides that a financial company may be subject to a special orderly liquidation process outside the federal bankruptcy code, administered by the FDIC as receiver, upon a determination (with the approval of the director of the Federal Insurance Office if – as is true with respect to Prudential Financial – the largest United States subsidiary is an insurer) that the company is in default or in danger of default and presents a systemic risk to U.S. financial stability. Were Prudential Financial subject to such a proceeding, our U.S. insurance subsidiaries would remain subject to rehabilitation and liquidation proceedings under state law, although the FDIC has discretion and authority to initiate resolution of an insurer under state law if its state insurance regulator has not filed the appropriate judicial action within 60 days of a systemic risk determination. However, our non-insurance U.S. subsidiaries engaged in financial activities would be subject to any special orderly liquidation process so commenced. We cannot predict how creditors of Prudential Financial or its insurance and non-insurance subsidiaries, including the holders of Prudential Financial debt, will evaluate this potential or whether it will impact our financing or hedging costs.        •    Dodd-Frank establishes the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (“BCFP”) as an independent agency within the FRB to regulate consumer financial products and services offered primarily for personal, family or household purposes, with rule-making and enforcement authority over unfair, deceptive or abusive practices. Insurance products and services are not within the BCFP’s general jurisdiction, and broker-dealers and investment advisers are not subject to the BCFP’s jurisdiction when acting in their registered capacity. Retirement service providers such as us could become subject to the BCFP’s jurisdiction, but only if the Department of Labor and the Department of the Treasury agree. Otherwise, we believe we offer a very limited number of products subject to BCFP regulation and the impact of Dodd-Frank on our operations in this regard should not be material; however, it is possible that the regulations promulgated by the BCFP will assert jurisdiction more expansively than we anticipate.        •    Dodd-Frank includes various securities law reforms that may affect our business practices and the liabilities and/or exposures associated therewith, including:        •    The SEC is to conduct a study and may impose on registered broker-dealers that provide retail investors personalized investment advice about securities a new standard of conduct the same or similar as the overall standard for investment advisers (i.e. a fiduciary standard). The SEC may also require broker-dealers selling proprietary or a limited range of products to make certain disclosures and obtain customer consents or acknowledgements.        •    The SEC and other regulators are required to promulgate regulations requiring the securitizer, and possibly the originator of certain asset-backed securities to retain at least 5% of the credit risk of securities sold, which may apply to activities of our investment management segment if the regulations promulgated treat us as a securitizer or an originator.        •    Dodd-Frank imposes various assessments on financial companies, including (as applicable to the Company) ex-post assessments to provide funds necessary to repay any borrowing and to cover the costs of any special resolution of a financial company conducted under Title II (although the FDIC is to take into account assessments otherwise imposed under state insurance guaranty funds); if we were to become a Designated Financial Company, assessments to fund a newly-created Office of Financial Research which, among other things, assists the Council; and the costs of our new regulation by the FRB. We are unable to estimate these costs at this time.    257    Table of Contents Foreign governmental actions in response to the recent financial crisis could subject us to substantial additional regulation.    In addition to the adoption of Dodd-Frank in the United States, regulators and lawmakers around the world are actively reviewing the causes of the financial crisis and exploring steps to avoid similar problems in the future. In many respects, this work is being led by the Financial Stability Board (FSB), consisting of representatives of national financial authorities of the G20 nations. The G20 and the FSB have issued a series of papers and recommendations intended to produce significant changes in how financial companies, particularly companies that are members of large and complex financial groups, should be regulated. These proposals address such issues as financial group supervision, capital and solvency standards, systemic economic risk, corporate governance including executive compensation, and a host of related issues associated with responses to the financial crisis. The lawmakers and regulatory authorities in a number of jurisdictions in which we do business have already begun introducing legislative and regulatory changes consistent with G20 and FSB recommendations, including proposals governing consolidated regulation of insurance holdings companies by the Financial Services Agency (FSA) in Japan, proposals governing executive compensation by the financial regulators in Germany (BaFIN) and the United Kingdom (FSA), and proposals to permit U.S.-style class action litigation in the United Kingdom with respect to financial services claims.    We cannot predict with any certainty whether these actions will become effective or the effect they may have on the financial markets or on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.
