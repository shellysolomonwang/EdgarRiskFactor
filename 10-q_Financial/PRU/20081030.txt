Item 1A. Risk Factors,” in late September and early October A.M. Best, Fitch, Moody’s, and S&P each revised its outlook for the U.S. life insurance sector to negative from stable. We believe that the rating agencies may heighten the level of scrutiny that they apply to such institutions, may increase the frequency and scope of their credit reviews, may request additional information from the companies that they rate, and may adjust upward the capital and other requirements employed in the rating agency models for maintenance of certain ratings levels. In addition, actions we take to access third party financing, as discussed below, may in turn cause rating agencies to reevaluate our ratings.    A downgrade in the credit or financial strength (i.e., claims-paying) ratings of Prudential Financial or its rated subsidiaries could result in additional collateral requirements or other required payments under certain agreements, which are eligible to be satisfied in cash or by posting securities held by the subsidiaries subject to the agreements. A ratings downgrade of three ratings levels would result in estimated collateral posting requirements or payments under such agreements of approximately $175 million. In addition, a ratings downgrade by A.M. Best to A- for our domestic life insurance companies would require Prudential Insurance to post a letter of credit in the amount of $1.25 billion that we estimate would result in annual cash outflows of approximately $125 million, or collateral posting in the form of cash or securities to be held in a trust. We believe that the posting of such collateral would not be a material liquidity event for Prudential Insurance.    The primary components of capitalization for the Financial Services Businesses consist of the equity we attribute to the Financial Services Businesses (excluding accumulated other comprehensive income related to unrealized gains and losses on investments and pension and postretirement benefits) and outstanding capital debt of the Financial Services Businesses, as discussed below under “—Financing Activities.” Based on these components, the capital position of the Financial Services Businesses as of September 30, 2008 was as follows:                September 30, 2008      (in millions)   Attributed equity (excluding unrealized gains and losses on investments and pension /postretirement benefits)   $ 21,524   Junior subordinated debt (hybrid securities)(1)     1,518   Capital debt(1)     5,313           Total capital   $ 28,355              (1) Our capital debt to total capital ratio was 20.1% as of September 30, 2008. The ratio assumes that the hybrid securities we issued are attributed 75% equity credit, with the remaining 25% treated as capital debt.    As shown in the table above, as of September 30, 2008, the Financial Services Businesses had approximately $28.4 billion in capital, all of which was available to support the aggregate capital requirements of its three divisions and its Corporate and Other operations. Based on our assessments of these businesses and operations, we believe this level of capital was consistent with the AA ratings objectives of our insurance companies as of September 30, 2008.    The Risk Based Capital, or RBC, ratio is the primary measure by which we evaluate the capital adequacy of Prudential Insurance, which includes businesses in both the Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business. We manage Prudential Insurance’s RBC ratio to a level consistent with a AA ratings objective. RBC is determined by statutory formulas that consider risks related to the type and quality of the invested assets,     174    Table of Contents  insurance-related risks associated with Prudential Insurance’s products, interest rate risks and general business risks. The RBC ratio calculations are intended to assist insurance regulators in measuring the adequacy of Prudential Insurance’s statutory capitalization. As of September 30, 2008, we estimate that the total adjusted operating capital of our domestic life insurance subsidiaries met the RBC levels required to meet their ratings objectives. However, subsequent to September 30, 2008 market conditions have negatively impacted the level of capital in our domestic life insurance subsidiaries and absent a recovery in markets we will need to take capital management actions to maintain capital consistent with these ratings objectives, which may include redeployment of financial resources from internal sources or, if markets continue to decline, require external sources of capital. Certain of these capital management activities may require regulatory approval.    In the second quarter of 2008, Prudential Insurance declared an ordinary dividend of $727 million and an additional extraordinary dividend of $773 million to Prudential Holdings, LLC. These dividends were paid to Prudential Holdings in the second quarter of 2008 and in turn distributed to Prudential Financial. We anticipate that, unless market conditions improve, Prudential Insurance’s dividend capacity will be substantially constrained in 2009 due to the capital constraints referred to in the preceding paragraph.    In response to the financial crises affecting the banking system and financial markets, on October 3, 2008, President Bush signed the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, or EESA, into law. Pursuant to the EESA, the U.S. Treasury has the authority to, among other things, purchase up to $700 billion of mortgage-backed and other securities from financial institutions for the purpose of stabilizing the financial markets. The U.S. Treasury and the bank regulatory agencies have also announced coordinated programs to invest an aggregate of $250 billion (out of the $700 billion) in capital issued by qualifying U.S. financial institutions and to guarantee senior debt of FDIC insured institutions and their qualifying holding companies, as well as deposits in non-interest bearing transaction accounts. The capital issuance program involves the issuance by qualifying institutions of preferred stock and warrants to purchase common stock to the U.S. Treasury. The U.S. federal government has taken or is considering taking other actions in order to address the financial crisis. We are currently evaluating the Company’s participation in the asset purchase programs, capital issuance programs and the debt guaranty programs.    Uses of Capital    Share Repurchases    In November 2007, Prudential Financial’s Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase at management’s discretion up to $3.5 billion of its outstanding Common Stock in calendar year 2008. In light of recent market volatility and extraordinary events and developments affecting financial markets generally, including market conditions for issuance of certain capital instruments such as hybrid securities, we have suspended all purchases of our Common Stock under the 2008 stock repurchase program effective October 10, 2008. During the first nine months of 2008, we repurchased 28.6 million shares of our Common Stock at a total cost of $2.125 billion. From January 1, 2008 through October 9, 2008, we repurchased 29.3 million shares of our Common Stock at a total cost of $2.161 billion.    Our share repurchase program, and any reinstatement thereof, is reviewed quarterly by the Finance Committee of Prudential Financial’s Board of Directors. Numerous factors could impact our decision to reinstate our share repurchase program, including increased capital needs of our businesses due to opportunities for organic growth, acquisitions, adverse market conditions impacting the earnings of our businesses or factors affecting our ability to access the capital markets in a cost effective manner. Our participation in certain EESA programs noted above could preclude reinstitution of our share repurchase program and, in any event, we presently do not foresee reinstitution this year.    175    Table of Contents Restrictions on Dividends and Returns of Capital from Subsidiaries    Our insurance and various other companies are subject to regulatory limitations on the payment of dividends and other transfers of funds to affiliates. With respect to Prudential Insurance, New Jersey insurance law provides that, except in the case of extraordinary dividends or distributions, all dividends or distributions paid by Prudential Insurance may be declared or paid only from unassigned surplus, as determined pursuant to statutory accounting principles, less unrealized investment gains and losses and revaluation of assets. Prudential Insurance must also notify the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance of its intent to pay a dividend or distribution. If the dividend or distribution, together with other dividends or distributions made within the preceding twelve months, exceeds a specified statutory limit it is considered an extraordinary dividend or distribution and Prudential Insurance must obtain the prior non-disapproval of the Department. The current statutory limitation applicable to New Jersey life insurers generally is the greater of 10% of the prior calendar year’s statutory surplus or the prior calendar year’s statutory net gain from operations excluding realized investment gains and losses. In addition to these regulatory limitations, the terms of the IHC debt contain restrictions potentially limiting dividends by Prudential Insurance applicable to the Financial Services Businesses in the event the Closed Block Business is in financial distress and under certain other circumstances.    The laws regulating dividends of the other states and foreign jurisdictions where our other insurance companies are domiciled are similar, but not identical, to New Jersey’s. Pursuant to Gibraltar Life’s reorganization, in addition to regulatory restrictions, there are certain restrictions on Gibraltar Life’s ability to pay dividends to Prudential Financial. We anticipate that it will be several years before these restrictions will allow Gibraltar Life to pay such dividends. There are also regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends by The Prudential Life Insurance Company, Ltd., or Prudential of Japan, which began paying dividends in 2006. Further, current market conditions have impacted capital positions of our international insurance companies, which could further restrict their ability to pay dividends. The ability of our asset management subsidiaries, and the majority of our other operating subsidiaries, to pay dividends is largely unrestricted.    Alternative Sources of Liquidity    Prudential Financial, the parent holding company, maintains an intercompany liquidity account that is designed to maximize the use of cash by facilitating the lending and borrowing of funds between the parent holding company and its affiliates on a daily basis. Depending on the overall availability of cash, the parent holding company invests excess cash on a short-term basis or borrows funds in the capital markets. Additional longer term liquidity is available through inter-affiliate borrowing arrangements. Prudential Financial and certain of its subsidiaries also have access to bank facilities, as discussed under “—Lines of Credit and Other Credit Facilities,” as well as the other alternative sources of liquidity described below.    Commercial Paper Programs    Prudential Financial has a commercial paper program rated A-1 by Standard & Poor’s, P-2 by Moody’s and F1 by Fitch with a current authorized capacity of $5.0 billion. Prudential Financial commercial paper borrowings are generally used to fund the working capital needs of Prudential Financial’s subsidiaries and provide short-term liquidity at Prudential Financial. Prudential Financial’s outstanding commercial paper borrowings were $761 million as of September 30, 2008, a decrease of $532 million from December 31, 2007, as a result of commercial paper being replaced by the proceeds from the floating rate convertible senior notes. As of September 30, 2008, $311 million of this outstanding commercial paper was funding working capital needs and the remaining $450 million was invested in short-term financial instruments. The weighted average interest rate on these borrowings were 3.27% and 5.38% for the nine months ended September 30, 2008 and 2007, respectively.    Prudential Funding, LLC, or Prudential Funding, a wholly owned subsidiary of Prudential Insurance, has a commercial paper program, rated A-1+ by Standard & Poor’s, P-1 by Moody’s and F1+ by Fitch with a current authorized capacity of $12.0 billion. Prudential Funding’s outstanding commercial paper, and master note borrowings, were $7.0 billion as of September 30, 2008, relatively unchanged from the $7.3 billion outstanding     176    Table of Contents  as of December 31, 2007. As of September 30, 2008, $3.5 billion of this outstanding commercial paper was funding short-term financial instruments, including a portion of our enhanced short-term portfolio which is discussed in more detail below under “—Asset-based Financing,” and the remainder was primarily utilized to fund short term cash flow timing mismatches, and fund working capital needs of our affiliates. The weighted average interest rates on these borrowings were 2.67% and 5.24% for the nine months ended September 30, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Prudential Financial has issued a subordinated guarantee covering Prudential Funding’s domestic commercial paper program.    During the latter half of 2007 and continuing through 2008, the credit markets, and specifically the commercial paper market, were adversely impacted by concerns over the sub-prime mortgage exposure of certain financial institutions and asset-backed commercial paper programs. As a result, the financing cost of Prudential Financial commercial paper increased versus its historical cost basis relative to the target federal funds rate as investors demanded a premium for such “top-tier split” rated commercial paper. While the financing cost of Prudential Funding commercial paper remained relatively unchanged versus its historical cost basis relative to target federal funds rate over the same period, we saw a modest increase in cost towards the end of September. Changes in investor demand have resulted in the weighted average maturity of Prudential Financial commercial paper to decline from 28 days at June 30, 2008, to 16 days at September 30, 2008, and the weighted average maturity of Prudential Funding commercial paper to decline from 19 days at June 30, 2008, to 15 days at September 30, 2008. As of September 30, 2008 approximately 29% and 28%, respectively, of the outstanding commercial paper of Prudential Financial and Prudential Funding was overnight.    Based on current Prudential Financial and Prudential Funding commercial paper ratings, both of our commercial paper programs are eligible to participate in the Commercial Paper Funding Facility, or CPFF, sponsored by the Federal Government. The Federal Reserve has announced that CPFF will purchase eligible three-month unsecured and asset-backed U.S. dollar denominated commercial paper from eligible issuers. The maximum amount of commercial paper an issuer can sell to the CPFF is equivalent to the greatest amount of U.S. dollar denominated commercial paper the issuer had outstanding during any single day between January 1, 2008 and August 31, 2008. The greatest amount of commercial paper Prudential Financial and Prudential Funding had outstanding during such period was $1.297 billion on January 1, 2008, and $9.815 billion, on March 18, 2008, respectively. Unsecured commercial paper purchased by the CPFF will be discounted based on a rate equal to a spread (200 basis points) over the three-month overnight index swap rate on the day of purchase. As of October 28, 2008, Prudential Financial has been granted approval to participate in the CPFF. We are currently evaluating whether we will apply for participation in the CPFF on behalf of Prudential Funding. Access to the CPFF is scheduled to terminate on April 30, 2009, unless such date is extended by the Federal Reserve.    We continue to monitor market conditions and believe we have sufficient flexibility to reduce our borrowings under the Prudential Financial and Prudential Funding commercial paper programs, if needed, through our alternative sources of liquidity, as discussed in this section.    Both commercial paper programs are backed by our unsecured committed lines of credit. As of September 30, 2008, Prudential Financial, Prudential Insurance and Prudential Funding had unsecured committed lines of credit totaling $5.0 billion. There were no outstanding borrowings under these facilities as of September 30, 2008. For a further discussion of lines of credit, see “—Lines of Credit and Other Credit Facilities.”    Asset-based Financing    We conduct asset-based or secured financing, including transactions such as securities lending and repurchase agreements, in order to earn spread income, to borrow funds, or to facilitate trading activity. These programs are driven by portfolio holdings in securities that are lendable based on counterparty demand for these securities in the marketplace. The collateral received in connection with these programs are primarily used to purchase securities in the short-term spread portfolios for our domestic insurance entities. Investments held in the short term spread     177    Table of Contents  portfolios include cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and fixed maturities, including mortgage- and asset-backed securities, with a weighted average life at time of purchase of two years or less. A portion of the asset-backed securities held in our short-term spread portfolios, including our enhanced short-term portfolio, are collateralized by sub-prime mortgages. See “—Realized Investment Gains and Losses and General Account Investments—General Account Investments—Fixed Maturity Securities” for a further discussion of our asset-backed securities collateralized by sub-prime holdings, including details regarding those securities held in our enhanced short-term portfolio. These short-term portfolios are subject to specific investment policy statements, which among other things, do not allow for significant asset/liability interest rate duration mismatch.    As of September 30, 2008, our Financial Services Businesses had liabilities totaling $6.938 billion under such programs, including $4.209 billion representing securities sold under agreements to repurchase, $2.231 billion representing cash collateral for loaned securities and $498 million representing securities sold but not yet purchased. Of the $6.938 billion for the Financial Services Businesses as of September 30, 2008, $3.126 billion represents securities that may be returned to the company overnight requiring immediate return of the cash collateral, and the remainder has maturities ranging from 2 days to 3 months with a weighted average maturity of 12 days.    As of September 30, 2008, our Closed Block Business had liabilities totaling $5.466 billion under such programs, including $4.217 billion representing securities sold under agreements to repurchase and $1.249 billion representing cash collateral for loaned securities. Of the $5.466 billion for the Closed Block Business as of September 30, 2008, $2.784 billion represents securities that may be returned to the company overnight requiring immediate return of the cash collateral, and the remainder has maturities ranging from 2 days to 3 months with a weighted average maturity of 13 days.    As of September 30, 2008, our domestic insurance entities had assets eligible for the lending program of $72.5 billion, of which $11.1 billion were on loan. Taking into account market conditions and outstanding loan balances as of September 30, 2008, we believe approximately $14 billion of the remaining eligible assets are readily lendable. Further deterioration in the market could reduce the lendability of available assets.    As referenced above, these programs are typically limited to securities in demand that can be loaned at relatively low financing rates. As such, we believe there is unused capacity available through these programs. Holdings of cash and cash equivalent investments in these short-term spread portfolios allow for further flexibility in sizing the portfolio to better match available financing. Current conditions in both the financing and investment markets are continuously monitored in order to appropriately manage the cost of funds, investment spreads, asset/liability duration matching and liquidity.    Federal Home Loan Bank of New York    In June 2008, Prudential Insurance became a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York, or FHLBNY. Membership allows Prudential Insurance to participate in FHLBNY’s product line of financial services, including funding agreements, general asset/liability management, and collateralized advances that can be used for liquidity management. Our membership in FHLBNY requires us to maintain ownership of member stock and any borrowings from FHLBNY will require us to purchase FHLBNY activity based stock in an amount equal to 4.5% of the borrowings.    Under guidance of the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance, the total amount of securities that can be pledged as collateral by Prudential Insurance to FHLBNY is limited to 5% of the prior year’s admitted assets of Prudential Insurance exclusive of separate account assets, which equates to $7.7 billion based on admitted assets as of December 31, 2007. Based on this permitted amount, the eligible securities available at Prudential Insurance, and net of the 4.5% activity based stock we would be obligated to purchase from FHLBNY based on maximum borrowings, the estimated total borrowing capacity with the FHLBNY is $6.7 billion, as of September 30, 2008. As of September 30, 2008, outstanding borrowings with FHLBNY amounted to $100 million. These borrowings matured on October 29, 2008.    178    Table of Contents Subsequent to September 30, 2008, we have borrowed an additional aggregate amount of $1.0 billion from the FHLBNY, with maturities ranging from April 7, 2009 to April 30, 2009. The proceeds from these borrowings are currently being invested in securities maintained in our enhanced short-term portfolio at Prudential Insurance. These proceeds are available as further sources of liquidity to Prudential Insurance. We may, from time to time, borrow additional funds from FHLBNY for purposes of managing our liquidity, asset/liability management, or issuance of funding agreements.    Economic Capital    We are in the process of developing an economic capital framework, and have begun using economic capital as an additional source of information for our business decisions. As we continue developing the framework, we will be assessing our overall capital position using both economic capital and our current framework, which is primarily based on risk based capital measures.    Liquidity of Subsidiaries    Domestic Insurance Subsidiaries    General Liquidity    Liquidity refers to a company’s ability to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the needs of its operations. We manage the liquidity of our domestic insurance operations to ensure stable, reliable and cost-effective sources of cash flows to meet all of our obligations. Liquidity is provided by a variety of sources, as described more fully below, including portfolios of liquid assets. The investment portfolios of our domestic operations are integral to the overall liquidity of those operations. We segment our investment portfolios and employ an asset/liability management approach specific to the requirements of our product lines. This enhances the discipline applied in managing the liquidity, as well as the interest rate and credit risk profiles, of each portfolio in a manner consistent with the unique characteristics of the product liabilities. We use a projection process for cash flows from operations to ensure sufficient liquidity to meet projected cash outflows, including claims.    Liquidity is measured against internally developed benchmarks that take into account the characteristics of both the asset portfolio and the liabilities that they support. The results are affected substantially by the overall asset type and quality of our investments.    Cash Flow    The principal sources of liquidity for Prudential Insurance and our other domestic insurance subsidiaries are premiums and annuity considerations, investment and fee income and investment maturities and sales associated with our insurance and annuity operations. The principal uses of that liquidity include benefits, claims, dividends paid to policyholders, and payments to policyholders and contractholders in connection with surrenders, withdrawals and net policy loan activity. Other uses of liquidity include commissions, general and administrative expenses, purchases of investments, and payments in connection with financing activities.    We believe that the cash flows from our insurance and annuity operations are adequate to satisfy the current liquidity requirements of these operations, including under reasonably foreseeable stress scenarios. The continued adequacy of this liquidity will depend upon factors such as future securities market conditions, changes in interest rate levels, policyholder perceptions of our financial strength, and the relative safety of competing products (including those with enhancements under EESA), each of which could lead to reduced cash inflows or increased cash outflows. In addition, market volatility can impact the level of capital required to support our businesses, particularly in our annuity business. As discussed above, subsequent to September 30, 2008 market conditions have negatively impacted the level of capital in our domestic life insurance subsidiaries and absent a recovery in markets we will need to take capital management actions to maintain capital consistent with their ratings objectives, which may include redeployment of financial resources from internal sources or, if markets continue to decline, require external sources of capital. Certain of these capital management activities may require regulatory approval.    179    Table of Contents Our domestic insurance operations’ cash flows from investment activities result from repayments of principal, proceeds from maturities and sales of invested assets and investment income, net of amounts reinvested. The primary liquidity risks with respect to these cash flows are the risk of default by debtors or bond insurers, our counterparties’ willingness to extend repurchase and/or securities lending arrangements and market volatility. We closely manage these risks through our credit risk management process and regular monitoring of our liquidity position.    In managing the liquidity of our domestic insurance operations, we also consider the risk of policyholder and contractholder withdrawals of funds earlier than our assumptions when selecting assets to support these contractual obligations. We use surrender charges and other contract provisions to mitigate the extent, timing and profitability impact of withdrawals of funds by customers from annuity contracts and deposit liabilities. The following table sets forth withdrawal characteristics of our general account annuity reserves and deposit liabilities (based on statutory liability values) as of the dates indicated.                        September 30, 2008     December 31,2007        Amount   % ofTotal     Amount   % ofTotal        ($ in millions)     Not subject to discretionary withdrawal provisions   $ 37,425   48 %   $ 35,847   49 %   Subject to discretionary withdrawal, with adjustment:                   With market value adjustment     20,185   26       18,786   26     At market value     1,288   2       1,162   2     At contract value, less surrender charge of 5% or more     3,602   4       1,594   2                               Subtotal     62,500   80       57,389   79     Subject to discretionary withdrawal at contract value with no surrender charge or surrender charge of less than 5%     15,790   20       15,346   21                               Total annuity reserves and deposit liabilities   $ 78,290   100 %   $ 72,735   100 %                              Individual life insurance policies are less susceptible to withdrawal than our annuity reserves and deposit liabilities because policyholders may incur surrender charges and be subject to a new underwriting process in order to obtain a new insurance policy. Our annuity reserves with guarantee features may be less susceptible to withdrawal than historical experience indicates, due to the current value of these guarantee features to policyholders as a result of recent market declines. Annuity benefits under group annuity contracts are generally not subject to early withdrawal.    Gross account withdrawals for our domestic insurance operations’ products amounted to approximately $16.0 billion and $14.4 billion for the first nine months of 2008 and 2007, respectively. Because these withdrawals were consistent with our assumptions in asset/liability management, the associated cash outflows did not have a material adverse impact on our overall liquidity.    Liquid Assets    Liquid assets include cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, fixed maturities that are not designated as held to maturity and public equity securities. As of September 30, 2008 and December 31, 2007, our domestic insurance operations had liquid assets of $129.6 billion and $137.0 billion, respectively, which includes a portion financed with asset-based financing . The portion of liquid assets comprised of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments was $10.7 billion and $7.1 billion as of September 30, 2008 and December 31, 2007, respectively. As of September 30, 2008, $102.3 billion, or 89%, of the fixed maturity investments that are not designated as held to maturity within our domestic insurance company general account portfolios were rated investment grade. The remaining $13.2 billion, or 11%, of these fixed maturity investments were rated non-investment grade. We consider attributes of the various categories of liquid assets (for example, type of asset     180    Table of Contents  and credit quality) in calculating internal liquidity measures in order to evaluate the adequacy of our domestic insurance operations’ liquidity under a variety of stress scenarios. We believe that the liquidity profile of our assets is sufficient to satisfy current liquidity requirements, including under foreseeable stress scenarios.    Given the size and liquidity profile of our investment portfolios, we believe that claim experience varying from our projections does not constitute a significant liquidity risk. Our asset/liability management process takes into account the expected maturity of investments and expected claim payments as well as the specific nature and risk profile of the liabilities. Historically, there has been no significant variation between the expected maturities of our investments and the payment of claims.    Our domestic insurance companies’ liquidity is managed through access to substantial investment portfolios as well as a variety of instruments available for funding and/or managing short-term cash flow mismatches, including from time to time those arising from claim levels in excess of projections. To the extent we need to pay claims in excess of projections, we may borrow temporarily or sell investments sooner than anticipated to pay these claims, which may result in increased borrowing costs or realized investment gains or losses affecting results of operations. For a further discussion of realized investment gains or losses, see “—Realized Investment Gains and Losses and General Account Investments—Realized Investment Gains and Losses.” We believe that borrowing temporarily or selling investments earlier than anticipated will not have a material impact on the liquidity of our domestic insurance companies. Payment of claims and sale of investments earlier than anticipated would have an impact on the reported level of cash flow from operating and investing activities, respectively, in our financial statements.    Prudential Funding, LLC    Prudential Funding, LLC, or Prudential Funding, a wholly owned subsidiary of Prudential Insurance, serves as an additional source of financing to meet the working capital needs of Prudential Insurance and its subsidiaries. Prudential Funding also lends to other subsidiaries of Prudential Financial up to limits established with the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance. To the extent that other subsidiaries of Prudential Financial have financing needs in excess of these limits, these needs are met through financing from Prudential Financial directly or from third parties. Prudential Funding operates under a support agreement with Prudential Insurance whereby Prudential Insurance has agreed to maintain Prudential Funding’s positive tangible net worth at all times. Prudential Funding borrows funds primarily through the direct issuance of commercial paper. Prudential Funding’s commercial paper, including master note borrowings, were $7.0 billion as of September 30, 2008 and $7.3 billion as of December 31, 2007, and are more fully discussed in “—Alternate Sources of Liquidity.” The impact of Prudential Funding’s financing capacity on liquidity is considered in the internal liquidity measures of the domestic insurance operations.    The total principal amount of debt outstanding under Prudential Funding’s domestic medium-term note programs was $172 million and $772 million, as of September 30, 2008 and December 31, 2007, respectively, of which $600 million was reflected in the general obligation short-term debt as of December 31, 2007. The weighted average interest rates on Prudential Funding’s long-term debt, including the effect of interest rate hedging activity, were 4.23%, and 6.24% for the nine months ended September 30, 2008 and 2007, respectively.    International Insurance Subsidiaries    In our international insurance operations, liquidity is provided through ongoing operations as well as portfolios of liquid assets. In managing the liquidity and the interest and credit risk profiles of our international insurance portfolios, we employ a discipline similar to the discipline employed for domestic insurance subsidiaries. We monitor liquidity through the use of internal liquidity measures, taking into account the liquidity of the asset portfolios.    As with our domestic operations, in managing the liquidity of these operations, we consider the risk of policyholder and contractholder withdrawals of funds earlier than our assumptions in selecting assets to support     181    Table of Contents  these contractual obligations. As of September 30, 2008 and December 31, 2007, our international insurance subsidiaries had total general account insurance related liabilities (other than dividends payable to policyholders) of $57.7 billion and $54.4 billion, respectively. Of those amounts, $31.0 billion and $29.5 billion, respectively, were associated with Gibraltar Life.    Concurrent with our acquisition of Gibraltar Life in April 2001, substantially all of its insurance liabilities were restructured under a plan of reorganization to include special surrender penalties on existing policies. These charges, initially 15%, declining to their current 2% level, and reducing to 0% in April 2009, were designed to mitigate the extent, timing, and profitability impact of withdrawals of funds by customers. The charges apply to $20.7 billion and $21.1 billion of Gibraltar Life’s insurance related reserves as of September 30, 2008 and December 31, 2007, respectively.    Policies issued by Gibraltar Life post-acquisition are not subject to the above restructured policy surrender charge schedule. Policies issued post-acquisition are generally subject to discretionary withdrawal at contract value, less applicable surrender charges, which currently start at 5% or more.    A special dividend to certain Gibraltar Life policyholders was payable in 2005 and will again be payable in 2009. The special dividend is based on 70% of the net increase in the fair value, through March 2009, of certain real estate and loans, net of transaction costs and taxes, included in the Gibraltar Life reorganization plan. As of September 30, 2008, a liability of $461 million related to the special dividend is included in “Policyholders’ dividends.” The special dividend will take the form of additional policy values, and to a lesser extent, cash. Gibraltar Life’s investment portfolio is structured to provide adequate liquidity for the special dividend.    Prudential of Japan had $21.3 billion and $19.2 billion of general account insurance related liabilities, other than dividends to policyholders, as of September 30, 2008 and December 31, 2007, respectively. Prudential of Japan did not have a material amount of general account annuity reserves or deposit liabilities subject to discretionary withdrawal as of September 30, 2008 or December 31, 2007. Additionally, we believe that the individual life insurance policies sold by Prudential of Japan do not have significant withdrawal risk because policyholders may incur surrender charges and must undergo a new underwriting process in order to obtain a new insurance policy.    As of September 30, 2008 and December 31, 2007, our international insurance subsidiaries had cash and short-term investments of approximately $1.5 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively, and fixed maturity investments, other than those designated as held to maturity, with fair values of $43.7 billion and $42.1 billion, respectively. As of September 30, 2008, $42.5 billion, or 97%, of the fixed maturity investments that are not designated as held to maturity within our international insurance subsidiaries were rated investment grade. The remaining $1.2 billion, or 3%, of these fixed maturity investments were rated non-investment grade. Of those amounts, $23.4 billion of the investment grade fixed maturity investments and $0.8 billion of the non-investment grade fixed maturity investments were associated with Gibraltar Life. We consider attributes of the various categories of liquid assets (for example, type of asset and credit quality) in calculating internal liquidity measures to evaluate the adequacy of our international insurance operations’ liquidity under stress scenarios. We believe that ongoing operations and the liquidity profile of our international insurance assets provide sufficient liquidity under reasonably foreseeable stress scenarios.    We employ various hedging strategies to manage potential exposure to foreign currency exchange rate movements as discussed in “—Results of Operations for Financial Services Businesses by Segment—International Insurance and Investments Division.” Cash settlements from this hedging activity result in cash flows to or from Prudential Financial and are dependent on changes in foreign currency exchange rates and the notional amount of the exposures hedged. The cash settlements include those for internal hedges related to the U.S. dollar denominated investments held on the books of the yen-based entities as well as for external hedges. A significant yen appreciation over an extended period would result in net cash outflows from Prudential Financial in excess of our historical experience.    182    Table of Contents Asset Management Subsidiaries    Our fee-based asset management businesses, which include real estate, public and private fixed income and public equity asset management, as well as commercial mortgage origination and servicing, and retail investment products, such as mutual funds and other retail services, are largely unregulated from the standpoint of dividends and distributions. Our asset management subsidiaries through which we conduct these businesses generally do not have restrictions on the amount of distributions they can make, and provide a relatively stable source of significant cash flow to Prudential Financial.    The principal sources of liquidity for our fee-based asset management businesses include asset management fees, and commercial mortgage servicing fees. The principal uses of liquidity include general and administrative expenses, and distribution of dividends and returns of capital to Prudential Financial. The primary liquidity risks for our fee based asset management businesses relate to their profitability, which is impacted by market conditions and our investment management performance. We believe the cash flows from our fee based asset management businesses are adequate to satisfy the current liquidity requirements of their operations, as well as requirements that could arise under foreseeable stress scenarios, which are monitored through the use of internal measures.    The principal sources of liquidity for our proprietary investments are cash flows from investments, the ability to liquidate certain investments, and available borrowing lines from internal sources, including Prudential Funding and Prudential Financial, and external sources. The primary liquidity risks include the inability to sell assets in a timely manner, declines in the value of assets and credit defaults. The current adverse market conditions have increased the liquidity risks associated with our proprietary investments. The markets for certain investments, such as commercial mortgages and real estate, have become less liquid. If we needed to sell these investments, we may have difficulty doing so in a timely manner at a price that we could otherwise realize. Subsequent to September 30, 2008, the Asset Management business gave notice of its intention to withdraw its investment from a proprietary fixed income fund, which was $286 million as of September 30, 2008, with the timing of the withdrawal and amount to be received depending on market conditions. We also anticipate making further reductions in certain proprietary equity investments.    As of September 30, 2008 and December 31, 2007, our asset management subsidiaries had cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1.751 billion and $1.153 billion, respectively, which include $977 million and $387 million of short term loans to real estate funds, respectively.    In reporting results for the three months ended March 31, 2008, we have classified our commercial mortgage securitization operations as a divested business for all periods reported, reflecting our decision to exit this business. We retained and continue the remainder of our commercial mortgage origination, servicing and other commercial mortgage related activities, which remain a part of our Asset Management segment. We do not expect this decision to have a material impact on the liquidity of our Asset Management subsidiaries. For further details, see “—Divested Businesses.”    Prudential Securities Group    As of September 30, 2008 and December 31, 2007, Prudential Securities Group’s assets totaled $11.9 billion and $8.1 billion, respectively. Prudential Securities Group owns our investment in Wachovia Securities, which we account for under the equity method, as well as other wholly owned businesses. On October 1, 2007, Wachovia completed the acquisition of A.G. Edwards, Inc., or A.G. Edwards, for $6.8 billion and on January 1, 2008 combined the retail securities brokerage business of A.G. Edwards with Wachovia Securities. On October 3, 2008, Wachovia and Wells Fargo announced that they had entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, pursuant to which Wells Fargo will acquire all of Wachovia Corporation and all its businesses and obligations. Wachovia has notified us that Wells Fargo’s brokerage business will be contributed to the joint venture in accordance with the terms of the existing joint venture agreements. See Note 11 to the Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information concerning this acquisition and its effect on     183    Table of Contents  our investment in Wachovia Securities. Distributions from our investment in Wachovia Securities to Prudential Securities Group totaled $104 million and $275 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2008 and 2007, respectively.    The other wholly owned businesses in Prudential Securities Group continue to maintain sufficiently liquid balance sheets, consisting mostly of cash and cash equivalents, segregated client assets, and short-term receivables from clients, broker-dealers, and exchanges. As registered broker-dealers and members of various self-regulatory organizations, our U.S. registered broker-dealer subsidiaries and Wachovia Securities are subject to the SEC’s Uniform Net Capital Rule, as well as the net capital requirements of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the various securities and commodities exchanges of which they are members. Compliance with these capital requirements could limit the ability of these operations to pay dividends.    Financing Activities    As of September 30, 2008 and December 31, 2007, total short- and long-term debt of the Company on a consolidated basis was $32.4 billion and $29.8 billion, respectively, which includes $18.8 billion and $16.7 billion, respectively, related to the parent company, Prudential Financial. As of September 30, 2008 we were in compliance with all debt covenants.    Prudential Financial is authorized to borrow funds from various sources to meet its capital and other funding needs, as well as the capital and other funding needs of its subsidiaries. The following table sets forth the outstanding short- and long-term debt of Prudential Financial, other than debt to consolidated subsidiaries, as of the dates indicated:                  September 30,2008   December 31,2007      (in millions)   Borrowings:           General obligation short-term debt:           Commercial paper   $ 761   $ 1,293   Floating rate convertible senior notes     4,883     4,883   Foreign denominated bridge loan facility     697     —    Current portion of long-term debt     278     973   General obligation long-term debt:           Senior debt     7,251     6,875   Junior subordinated debt (hybrid securities)     1,518     —    Retail medium-term notes     3,434     2,688                 Total general obligations   $ 18,822   $ 16,712                  The following table presents, as of September 30, 2008, Prudential Financial’s contractual maturities of its general obligation long-term debt:                  Calendar Year   SeniorDebt   JuniorSubordinatedDebt   RetailMedium-termNotes      (in millions)   2009   $ —    $ —    $ 7   2010     25     —      30   2011     350     —      135   2012     250     —      147   2013     1,100     —      234   2014 and thereafter     5,526     1,518     2,881                       Total   $ 7,251   $ 1,518   $ 3,434                        184    Table of Contents Prudential Financial’s short-term debt includes commercial paper in the amount of $761 million, foreign currency denominated bridge loan facilities totaling $697 million, our convertible senior notes issued in December 2006 in the amount of $1.883 billion, and our convertible senior notes issued in December 2007 in the amount of $3.0 billion. Prudential Financial’s commercial paper program is more fully discussed in “—Alternate Sources of Liquidity” and the foreign currency denominated bridge loan facilities are more fully discussed below.    As described more fully later in this section, holders of our senior convertible notes issued in December 2006 may require us to repurchase the notes at par, plus accrued interest, on December 12, 2008. We have sufficient cash on our balance sheet to defease our obligation. The proceeds from our senior convertible notes issued in December 2007 are currently funding working capital needs of our subsidiaries. Holders of the December 2007 notes may require us to repurchase the notes at par, plus accrued interest, on June 15, 2009. If market conditions improve and so permit, we intend to refinance these notes in the capital markets. In the event we remain unable to issue debt in the capital markets in the remainder of 2008 through June 2009, and the investors elect to sell the notes to us, we intend to defease our obligation through a combination of alternate sources of funds, such as commercial paper, internal sources of funds, and reduction in working capital needs of our businesses.    In March 2006, Prudential Financial filed an updated shelf registration statement with the SEC, superseding its previous shelf registration statement, which permits the issuance of public debt, equity and hybrid securities. The updated shelf registration statement was established under the SEC rules adopted in 2005 that allow for automatic effectiveness upon filing, pay-as-you-go fees and the ability to add securities by filing automatically effective amendments for companies qualifying as “Well-Known Seasoned Issuers.” As a result, this new shelf registration statement has no stated issuance capacity.    In March 2006, Prudential Financial filed a prospectus supplement for a new Medium-Term Notes, Series D program under the shelf registration statement, which superseded its Medium-Term Notes, Series C program. In January 2008, the authorized issuance capacity of the Series D program was increased by $5 billion to $10 billion, and as of September 30, 2008 approximately $4.9 billion remained available under the program. In January 2008, Prudential Financial issued $600 million of 5-year medium term notes under this program. The net proceeds from the sale of these notes were used to fund operating needs of our subsidiaries and for general corporate purposes. The weighted average interest rates on Prudential Financial’s medium-term and senior notes, including the effect of interest rate hedging activity, were 5.43% and 5.40% for the nine months ended September 30, 2008 and 2007, respectively, excluding the effect of debt issued to consolidated subsidiaries. Given the current disruptions in the credit markets, it is uncertain whether we can issue debt under our MTN program at this time.    In March 2006, Prudential Financial filed a prospectus supplement under the shelf registration statement for its retail medium-term notes, including the InterNotes® program, which superseded the 2005 retail medium-term notes program. In March 2008, the authorized issuance capacity of the retail medium-term notes program was increased by $2.5 billion to $5 billion, and as of September 30, 2008 approximately $2.3 billion remained available under the program. This retail medium-term notes program serves as a funding source for a spread product of our Retirement segment that is economically similar to funding agreement-backed medium-term notes issued to institutional investors, except that the retail notes are senior obligations of Prudential Financial and are purchased by retail investors. The weighted average interest rates on Prudential Financial’s retail medium-term notes were 5.97% and 5.59% for the nine months ended September 30, 2008 and 2007, respectively, excluding the effect of debt issued to consolidated subsidiaries.    In May, 2008, Prudential Financial borrowed Y74 billion under unsecured bridge loan facilities provided by two institutions that expires on February 13, 2009. The net proceeds were used to repay maturing debt that was issued concurrently with our acquisition of Gibraltar Life in April 2001, which serves to fund capital requirements of Gibraltar Life. The carrying value of these loans were $697 million as of September 30, 2008,     185    Table of Contents  and they serve as a net investment hedge of our Japanese insurance operations. Upon expiration of these facilities, we intend to refinance these loans in the domestic or international capital markets, market conditions permitting, or use available internal sources of funds to repay the loans.    In June 2008, Prudential Financial issued $600 million of 8.875% fixed-to-floating rate junior subordinated notes to institutional investors. Also in June 2008, Prudential Financial issued $800 million of junior subordinated notes to retail investors with a fixed interest rate of 9.0% paid quarterly. In July 2008, Prudential Financial issued an additional $120 million of retail junior subordinated notes following the underwriters’ exercise of their over-allotment option. Both issuances are considered hybrid capital securities, which receive enhanced equity treatment from the rating agencies. Both series of notes have a scheduled maturity of June 15, 2038 and a final maturity of June 15, 2068. Prudential Financial is required to use commercially reasonable efforts, subject to market disruption events, to raise sufficient proceeds from the issuance of specified qualifying capital securities, which include hybrid capital securities, to repay the principal of the notes at their scheduled maturity. For the institutional notes, interest is payable semi-annually at a fixed rate of 8.875% until June 15, 2018, from which date interest is payable quarterly at a floating rate of 3-month LIBOR plus 5.00%. Prudential Financial may redeem the institutional notes, subject to the terms of the replacement capital covenant, or RCC, as discussed below, in whole or in part, on or after June 15, 2018 at their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, or prior to June 15, 2018 at a make-whole price. Prudential Financial may redeem the retail notes subject to the terms of the RCC as discussed below, on or after June 15, 2013, in whole or in part, at their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, or prior to June 15, 2013, in whole, at a make-whole price. Both series of notes may also be redeemed in whole upon the occurrence of certain defined events. Prudential Financial has the right to defer interest payments on either or both series of notes for a period up to ten years, during which time interest will be compounded. If Prudential Financial were to exercise its right to defer interest it will be required, commencing on the earlier of (i) the first interest payment date on which current interest is paid after the deferral period or (ii) the fifth anniversary of the deferral period, to issue specified alternative payment securities, which include but are not limited to Common Stock, to satisfy its obligation with respect to the deferred interest. In connection with the issuance of both series of notes, Prudential Financial entered into a RCC for the benefit of holders of debt that is senior to the junior subordinated notes. Under the RCC, Prudential Financial agreed that it will not repay, redeem, defease, or purchase the notes prior to June 15, 2048, unless it has received proceeds from the issuance of specified replacement capital securities, which include but are not limited to hybrid capital securities as well as Common Stock. The RCC will terminate upon the occurrence of certain events, including acceleration due to an event of default. Prudential Financial used the proceeds from the issuance of these notes for general corporate purposes and to repurchase shares of its Common Stock under the existing 2008 share repurchase authorization. Both series of notes were assigned credit ratings of “A-” by S&P, “Baa1” by Moody’s, and “bbb” by A.M. Best.    In January 2008, Prudential Financial filed a prospectus supplement to register under the shelf registration statement resales of the floating rate convertible senior notes that were issued in a private placement in December 2006 ($2.0 billion). These convertible senior notes are convertible by the holders at any time after issuance into cash and shares of Prudential Financials Common Stock. The conversion price, $104.21 per share, is subject to adjustment upon certain corporate events. The conversion feature requires net settlement in shares; therefore, upon conversion, a holder would receive cash equal to the par amount of the convertible notes surrendered for conversion and shares of Prudential Financial Common Stock only for the portion of the settlement amount in excess of the par amount, if any. The interest rate on these convertible senior notes is a floating rate equal to 3-month LIBOR minus 2.4%, to be reset quarterly. These convertible senior notes are redeemable by Prudential Financial, at par plus accrued interest, any time on or after December 13, 2007. Holders of the notes may also require Prudential Financial to repurchase the notes, at par plus accrued interest, on contractually specified dates, of which the first such date was December 12, 2007. On December 12, 2007, $117 million of senior notes were repurchased by Prudential Financial at the request of the holders. The next date on which holders of the notes may require Prudential Financial to repurchase the notes is December 12, 2008. Prior to such repurchase date, we may, from time to time, depending on economic considerations choose to redeem portions of the outstanding notes from certain qualified institutional buyers A majority of the proceeds from the original issuance of these     186    Table of Contents  notes was initially invested in an investment grade fixed income portfolio, while the remainder of the proceeds was used for general corporate purposes. Prior to the first date that holders of the notes could require us to repurchase the notes, December 12, 2007, we liquidated the investment portfolio. Currently, the remaining proceeds are invested in short-term instruments and may be used to fund operations or short-term capital needs in lieu of other short-term borrowings in future periods. See Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Current Report on Form 8-K dated May 16, 2008 for additional information concerning these convertible senior notes. Prudential Financial is obligated to file once per quarter a prospectus supplement to register any resales of these convertible senior notes and shares of Prudential Financial Common Stock, if any, issued to holders of these convertible senior notes.    In April and July 2008, Prudential Financial filed prospectus supplements to register under the shelf registration statement resales of the floating rate convertible senior notes that were issued in a private placement in December 2007 ($3.0 billion). These convertible senior notes are convertible by the holders at any time after issuance into cash and shares of Prudential Financial’s Common Stock. The conversion price, $132.39 per share, is subject to adjustment upon certain corporate events. The conversion feature requires net settlement in shares; therefore, upon conversion, a holder would receive cash equal to the par amount of the convertible notes surrendered for conversion and shares of Prudential Financial Common Stock only for the portion of the settlement amount in excess of the par amount, if any. Prudential Financial used the majority of the offering proceeds to fund operating needs of our subsidiaries, purchase short-term investment grade fixed income investments, and general corporate purposes, as well as to repurchase shares of its Common Stock under the 2007 share repurchase authorization. A portion of the offering proceeds used to fund the operating needs of subsidiaries were used to reduce Prudential Financial’s commercial paper borrowings and to extend the duration of our borrowings to better match the duration of the subsidiaries’ related assets. These convertible senior notes are redeemable by Prudential Financial, at par plus accrued interest, on or after June 16, 2009. Holders of the notes may also require Prudential Financial to repurchase the notes, at par plus accrued interest, on contractually specified dates, of which the first such date is June 15, 2009. The interest rate on these convertible senior notes is a floating rate equal to 3-month LIBOR minus 1.63%, to be reset quarterly. See Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Current Report on Form 8-K dated May 16, 2008 for additional information concerning these convertible senior notes. Prudential Financial is obligated to file once per quarter a prospectus supplement under the shelf registration statement to register any resales of these convertible senior notes and shares of Prudential Financial Common Stock, if any, issued to holders of these convertible senior notes.    We will be required beginning on January 1, 2009 to retrospectively adopt the requirements of Financial Statement Position APB 14-1, “Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement).” This guidance will impact the accounting for our convertible debt instruments as discussed in Note 2 to the Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements.    In March 2008, Prudential Financial updated its European medium-term notes program under a shelf registration statement. The Company is authorized to issue up to $1.5 billion of notes under the program. As of September 30, 2008, there was no debt outstanding under this program.    Current capital markets activities for the Company on a consolidated basis principally consist of unsecured short-term and long-term debt borrowings issued by Prudential Funding and Prudential Financial, unsecured third party bank borrowings, and asset-based or secured financing.    187    Table of Contents The following table sets forth total consolidated borrowings of the Company as of the dates indicated:                  September 30,2008   December 31,2007      (in millions)   Borrowings:           General obligation short-term debt   $ 14,028   $ 15,349                 General obligation long-term debt:           Senior debt     11,128     10,103   Junior subordinated debt (hybrid securities)     1,518     —    Surplus notes(1)     3,194     2,044                 Total general obligation long-term debt     15,840     12,147                 Total general obligations     29,868     27,496                 Limited and non-recourse borrowing:           Limited and non-recourse short-term debt     511     308   Limited and non-recourse long-term debt(2)     2,030     1,954                 Total limited and non-recourse borrowing     2,541     2,262                 Total borrowings(3)     32,409     29,758                 Total asset-based financing     12,404     18,236                 Total borrowings and asset-based financings   $ 44,813   $ 47,994                    (1) As of September 30, 2008 and December 31, 2007, includes $2.750 billion and $1.600 billion, respectively, of floating rate surplus notes issued by subsidiaries of Prudential Insurance to fund regulatory reserves, as well as $444 million of fixed rate surplus notes issued by Prudential Insurance.    (2) As of both September 30, 2008 and December 31, 2007, $1.750 billion, of limited and non-recourse debt outstanding was attributable to the Closed Block Business.    (3) Does not include $7.7 billion and $8.5 billion of medium-term notes of consolidated trust entities secured by funding agreements purchased with the proceeds of such notes as of September 30, 2008 and December 31, 2007, respectively. These notes are included in “Policyholders’ account balances.” For additional information see “—Funding Agreement Notes Issuance Program.”    Total general debt obligations increased by $2.372 billion from December 31, 2007 to September 30, 2008, reflecting a $3.693 billion increase in long-term debt and a $1.321 billion net decrease in short-term debt. The net increase in long-term debt was primarily driven by the issuance of junior subordinated debt in the second quarter of 2008, as well as the net issuance of medium-term notes, retail medium-term notes, and surplus notes, partially offset by the reclassification of long-term debt to short-term debt, in the first quarter of 2008. The net decrease in short-term debt was primarily due to a decrease in outstanding commercial paper supporting our operating businesses at Prudential Funding and Prudential Financial, and the maturity of medium term notes.    During 2006, a subsidiary of Prudential Insurance entered into a surplus note purchase agreement with an unaffiliated financial institution that provides for the issuance of up to $3 billion of ten-year floating rate surplus notes for the purpose of financing certain regulatory reserves required to be held by subsidiary life insurers in connection with the intercompany reinsurance of certain term life insurance policies. Concurrent with the issuance of each surplus note, Prudential Financial enters into arrangements with the buyer, which are accounted for as derivative instruments, that may result in payments by, or to, Prudential Financial over the term of the surplus notes, to the extent there are significant changes in the value of the surplus notes. Principal factors that impact the value of the surplus notes are mortality experience and interest rates. As of September 30, 2008, there have been no payments made under the derivative instrument. Surplus notes issued under this facility are subordinated to policyholder obligations and are subject to regulatory approvals for principal and interest payments. In the first nine months of 2008, the subsidiary issued an additional $1.150 billion of surplus notes, resulting in total outstanding notes under this facility of $2.250 billion and $1.100 billion as of September 30, 2008 and December 31, 2007, respectively. See Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Current Report on Form 8-K dated May 16, 2008 for additional information.    188    Table of Contents During 2007, a subsidiary of Prudential Insurance issued $500 million of 45-year floating rate surplus notes to an unaffiliated financial institution for the purpose of financing certain regulatory reserves required to be held by subsidiary life insurers in connection with the intercompany reinsurance of certain universal life insurance policies. Surplus notes issued under this facility are subordinated to policyholder obligations and are subject to regulatory approvals for principal and interest payments. See Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Current Report on Form 8-K dated May 16, 2008 for additional information. Concurrent with the issuance of these surplus notes, Prudential Financial entered into a credit derivative that will require Prudential Financial to make certain payments in the event of deterioration in the value of the surplus note. Under this credit derivative, we are required to post cash collateral based on tests that consider the level of 10-year credit default swap spreads on Prudential Financial’s senior debt. We estimate that the collateral posting requirements would range from $100 million to $200 million at effective 10-year credit default swap spreads of 700 to 2,000 basis points.    Our total borrowings consist of capital debt, investment related debt, securities business related debt and debt related to specified other businesses. Capital debt is borrowing that is used or will be used to meet the capital requirements of Prudential Financial as well as borrowings invested in equity or debt securities of direct or indirect subsidiaries of Prudential Financial and subsidiary borrowings utilized for capital requirements. Investment related borrowings consist of debt issued to finance specific investment assets or portfolios of investment assets, including institutional spread lending investment portfolios, real estate and real estate related investments held in consolidated joint ventures, as well as institutional and insurance company portfolio cash flow timing differences. Securities business related debt consists of debt issued to finance primarily the liquidity of our broker-dealers and our capital markets and other securities business related operations. Debt related to specified other businesses consists of borrowings associated with our individual annuity business, real estate franchises and relocation services. Borrowings under which either the holder is entitled to collect only against the assets pledged to the debt as collateral, or has only very limited rights to collect against other assets, have been classified as limited and non-recourse debt. Consolidated borrowings as of September 30, 2008 and December 31, 2007 included $1.750 billion of limited and non-recourse debt attributable to the Closed Block Business.    The following table summarizes our borrowings, categorized by use of proceeds, as of the dates indicated:                  September 30,2008   December 31,2007      (in millions)   General obligations:           Capital debt   $ 6,831   $ 4,781   Investment related     16,557     16,379   Securities business related     4,753     4,776   Specified other businesses     1,727     1,560                 Total general obligations     29,868     27,496   Limited and non-recourse debt     2,541     2,262                 Total borrowings   $ 32,409   $ 29,758                 Short-term debt   $ 14,539   $ 15,657   Long-term debt     17,870     14,101                 Total borrowings   $ 32,409   $ 29,758                 Borrowings of Financial Services Businesses   $ 29,908   $ 26,865   Borrowings of Closed Block Business     2,501     2,893                 Total borrowings   $ 32,409   $ 29,758                  189    Table of Contents Funding Agreement Notes Issuance Program    In 2003, Prudential Insurance established a Funding Agreement Notes Issuance Program pursuant to which a Delaware statutory trust issues medium-term notes (which are included in our statements of financial position in “Policyholders’ account balances” and not included in the foregoing table) secured by funding agreements issued to the trust by Prudential Insurance and included in our Retirement segment. The funding agreements provide cash flow sufficient for the debt service on the related medium-term notes. The medium-term notes are sold in transactions not requiring registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The notes have fixed or floating interest rates and original maturities ranging from two to seven years. As of September 30, 2008 and December 31, 2007, the outstanding aggregate principal amount of such notes totaled approximately $7.7 billion and $8.5 billion, respectively, out of a total authorized amount of up to $15 billion. The decrease in outstanding aggregate principal amount of such notes is reflective of maturities outpacing new issuances during 2008. The aggregate maturities of these notes over the next 12 months is approximately $2.5 billion. In the event we are unable to sell new issuances of theses notes, we intend to repay the maturing notes through a combination of cash flows from asset maturities, asset sales, and internal sources of funds such as Prudential Funding.    Lines of Credit and Other Credit Facilities    As of September 30, 2008, Prudential Financial, Prudential Insurance and Prudential Funding had unsecured committed lines of credit totaling $5.0 billion. These facilities are available to each of the borrowers, up to the aggregate committed credit, to be used for general corporate purposes. This amount includes a $500 million 364-day credit facility that expires in December 2008, which includes eight financial institutions, a $2.0 billion 5-year credit facility that expires in May 2012, which includes 22 financial institutions, and an additional $2.5 billion credit facility, of which $200 million expires in December 2011 and $2.3 billion expires in December 2012, which includes 20 financial institutions. Subsequent to September 30, 2008, Lehman Commercial Paper, Inc., a lender in the $2.0 billion facility for a total of $60 million, filed for bankruptcy bringing the current total of unsecured committed credit lines available to $4.94 billion. Within each facility, no single financial institution has more than 15% of the total committed credit. Borrowings under the outstanding facilities will mature no later than the respective expiration dates of the facilities and will bear interest at the rates set forth in each facility agreement. We maintain these facilities primarily as back-up liquidity lines for our commercial paper programs, and there were no outstanding borrowings under any of these facilities as of September 30, 2008.    Our ability to borrow under these facilities is conditioned on the continued satisfaction of customary conditions, including maintenance at all times by Prudential Insurance of total adjusted capital of at least $5.5 billion based on statutory accounting principles prescribed under New Jersey law and Prudential Financial’s maintenance of consolidated net worth of at least $12.5 billion, calculated in accordance with GAAP. Our ability to borrow under these facilities is not contingent on our credit ratings or subject to material adverse change clauses. Prudential Insurance’s total adjusted capital was $8.5 billion and $11.0 billion as of June 30, 2008 and December 31, 2007, respectively, and we expect this amount to be $7.3 billion as of September 30, 2008. Prudential Financial’s net worth on a consolidated basis totaled $18.7 billion and $23.5 billion as of September 30, 2008 and December 31, 2007, respectively. We also use uncommitted lines of credit from banks and other financial institutions.    Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk    Market risk is the risk of change in the value of financial instruments as a result of absolute or relative changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates or equity or commodity prices. To varying degrees, the investment and trading activities supporting all of our products and services generate market risks. There have been no material changes in our market risk exposures from December 31, 2007, a description of which may be found in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2007, Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,” filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. See Item 1A, “Risk Factors” of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a discussion of how the current difficult conditions in the financial markets and the economy generally may materially adversely affect our business and results of our operations.    190    Table of Contents Item 4. Controls and Procedures     In order to ensure that the information we must disclose in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported on a timely basis, the Company’s management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, have reviewed and evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e), as of September 30, 2008. Based on such evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of September 30, 2008, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. No change in our internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f), occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2008, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.    191    Table of Contents PART II—OTHER INFORMATION    Item 1. Legal Proceedings     We are subject to legal and regulatory actions in the ordinary course of our businesses, including class action lawsuits. Our pending legal and regulatory actions include proceedings specific to us and proceedings generally applicable to business practices in the industries in which we operate including, in both cases, businesses that have either been divested or placed in wind-down status. We are also subject to litigation arising out of our general business activities, such as our investments, contracts, leases and labor and employment relationships, including claims of discrimination and harassment. In some of our pending legal and regulatory actions, parties are seeking large and/or indeterminate amounts, including punitive or exemplary damages.    In August 2008, the Company reached a resolution of the previously disclosed investigation by the SEC into certain reinsurance contracts entered into with a single counterparty in the years 1997 through 2002 relating to the Company’s property and casualty insurance operations that were sold in 2003. The SEC’s complaint in this matter, filed on August 6, 2008 in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, alleges, among other things, that the Company improperly accounted for the reinsurance contracts, resulting in overstatements of the Company’s consolidated results for the years 2000, 2001 and 2002 in certain of the Company’s reports filed with the SEC under the Exchange Act, in violation of the financial reporting, books-and-records and internal control provisions of the Exchange Act and related rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder. In connection with the settlement, the Company has consented to entry of a final judgment enjoining it from future violations of specified provisions of the Exchange Act and related rule and regulations of the SEC thereunder. The settlement, in which the Company neither admits nor denies the allegations in the complaint, resolves the SEC’s investigations into these matters without the imposition of any monetary fine or penalty. The settlement documents include allegations that may result in litigation, adverse publicity and other potentially adverse impacts to the Company’s businesses.    In September 2008, in Prudential Retirement Insurance & Annuity Co. v. State Street Global Advisors, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York denied the State Street defendants’ motion to dismiss claims for damages and other relief under Section 502(a)(2) of ERISA, but dismissed the claims for equitable relief under Section 502(a)(3) of ERISA. In October 2008, defendants answered the complaint and asserted counterclaims for contribution and indemnification, defamation and violations of Massachusetts’ unfair and deceptive trade practices law.    In September 2008, Wang v. Prudential Financial Inc. and Prudential Insurance, a purported nationwide class action involving the Company’s alleged failure to pay overtime, was transferred to the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey and consolidated with the Bouder matter.    Our litigation and regulatory matters are subject to many uncertainties, and given their complexity and scope, the outcomes cannot be predicted. It is possible that our results of operations or cash flow in a particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by an ultimate unfavorable resolution of pending litigation and regulatory matters depending, in part, upon the results of operations or cash flow for such period. In light of the unpredictability of the Company’s litigation and regulatory matters, it is also possible that in certain cases an ultimate unfavorable resolution of one or more pending litigation or regulatory matters could have a material adverse effect on our financial position. Management believes, however, that, based on information currently known to it, the ultimate outcome of all pending litigation and regulatory matters, after consideration of applicable reserves and rights to indemnification, is not likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial position.    The foregoing discussion is limited to recent material developments concerning our legal and regulatory proceedings. See Note 12 to the Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for additional discussion of our litigation and regulatory matters, including those referred to above.    192    Table of Contents Item 1A. Risk Factors    You should carefully consider the following risks. These risks could materially affect our business, results of operations or financial condition, cause the trading price of our Common Stock to decline materially or cause our actual results to differ materially from those expected or those expressed in any forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the Company. These risks are not exclusive, and additional risks to which we are subject include, but are not limited to, the factors mentioned under “Forward-Looking Statements” above and the risks of our businesses described elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in our 2007 Annual Report on Form 10-K.    Current difficult conditions in the global financial markets and the economy generally may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.     Our results of operations are materially affected by conditions in the global financial markets and the economy generally, both in the U.S. and elsewhere around the world. The stress experienced by global financial markets that began in the second half of 2007 continued and substantially increased during the third quarter of 2008. The volatility and disruption in the global financial markets have reached unprecedented levels. The availability and cost of credit has been materially affected. These factors, combined with volatile oil prices, depressed home prices and increasing foreclosures, falling equity market values, declining business and consumer confidence and the risks of increased inflation and unemployment, have precipitated an economic slowdown and fears of a severe recession.    The global fixed-income markets are experiencing a period of both extreme volatility and limited market liquidity conditions, which has affected a broad range of asset classes and sectors. As a result, the market for fixed income instruments has experienced decreased liquidity, increased price volatility, credit downgrade events, and increased probability of default. Global equity markets have also been experiencing heightened volatility. These events and the continuing market upheavals have had and may continue to have an adverse effect on us. Our revenues are likely to decline in such circumstances, the cost of meeting our obligations to our customers may increase, and our profit margins could erode. In addition, in the event of a prolonged economic downturn, we could incur significant losses in our investment portfolio.    The demand for our products could be adversely affected in an economic downturn characterized by higher unemployment, lower family income, lower consumer spending, lower corporate earnings and lower business investment. We also may experience a higher incidence of claims and lapses or surrenders of policies. Our policyholders may choose to defer or stop paying insurance premiums. We cannot predict whether or when such actions may occur, or what impact, if any, such actions could have on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.    In response to the financial crises affecting the banking system and financial markets, on October 3, 2008, President Bush signed the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (the “EESA”) into law. Pursuant to the EESA, the U.S. Treasury has the authority to, among other things, purchase up to $700 billion of mortgage-backed and other securities from financial institutions for the purpose of stabilizing the financial markets. The U.S. Treasury and the bank regulatory agencies have also announced coordinated programs to invest an aggregate of $250 billion (out of the $700 billion) in capital issued by qualifying U.S. financial institutions and to guarantee senior debt of all FDIC insured institutions and their qualifying holding companies, as well as deposits in non-interest bearing transaction accounts. The capital issuance program involves the issuance by qualifying institutions of preferred stock and warrants to purchase common stock to the U.S. Treasury. The U.S. federal government has taken or is considering taking other actions to address the financial crisis that could further impact our business. We are currently evaluating the Company’s participation in the asset purchase programs, capital issuance programs and the debt guaranty programs. We cannot predict with any certainty the effect these actions will have on the financial markets or on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.    193    Table of Contents Continuing adverse financial market conditions may significantly affect our ability to meet liquidity needs, our access to capital and our cost of capital, including capital that may be required by our subsidiaries.    Adverse capital market conditions have affected and may continue to affect the availability and cost of borrowed funds and could impact our ability to refinance existing borrowings, thereby ultimately impacting our profitability and ability to support or grow our businesses. We need liquidity to pay our operating expenses, interest on our debt and dividends on our capital stock and replace certain maturing debt obligations. Without sufficient liquidity, we could be forced to curtail certain of our operations, and our business could suffer. The principal sources of our liquidity are insurance premiums, annuity considerations, deposit funds and cash flow from our investment portfolio and assets, consisting mainly of cash or assets that are readily convertible into cash. Sources of liquidity in normal markets also include a variety of short- and long-term instruments, including securities lending and repurchase agreements, commercial paper, medium and long-term debt and capital securities.    Disruptions, uncertainty or volatility in the financial markets may limit our access to capital required to operate our business, most significantly our insurance operations. These market conditions may limit our ability to replace, in a timely manner, maturing debt obligations and access the capital necessary to grow our business, replace capital withdrawn by customers or raise new capital required by our subsidiaries as a result of volatility in the markets. As a result, we may be forced to delay raising capital, issue shorter tenor securities than would be optimal, bear an unattractive cost of capital or be unable to raise capital at any price, which could decrease our profitability and significantly reduce our financial flexibility. Actions we might take to access financing may in turn cause rating agencies to reevaluate our ratings.    In the event current resources do not satisfy our needs, we may have to seek additional financing. The availability of additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions, the general availability of credit, the overall availability of credit to the financial services industry, and our credit ratings and credit capacity. Our internal sources of liquidity may prove to be insufficient, and in such case, we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on favorable terms, or at all.    The Risk Based Capital, or RBC, ratio is the primary measure by which we evaluate the capital adequacy of Prudential Insurance, which includes businesses in both the Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business. We manage Prudential Insurance’s RBC ratio to a level consistent with a AA ratings objective. RBC is determined by statutory formulas that consider risks related to the type and quality of the invested assets, insurance-related risks associated with Prudential Insurance’s products, interest rate risks and general business risks. The RBC ratio calculations are intended to assist insurance regulators in measuring the adequacy of Prudential Insurance’s statutory capitalization. As of September 30, 2008, we estimate that the total adjusted operating capital of our domestic life insurance subsidiaries met the RBC levels required to meet their ratings objectives. However, subsequent to September 30, 2008 market conditions have negatively impacted the level of capital in our domestic life insurance subsidiaries and absent a recovery in markets we will need to take capital management actions to maintain capital consistent with these ratings objectives, which may include redeployment of financial resources from internal sources or, if markets continue to decline, require external sources of capital. Certain of these capital management activities may require regulatory approval.    Market fluctuations and general economic, market and political conditions may adversely affect our business and profitability.    Even under relatively more favorable market conditions (such as those prevailing before the second half of 2007), our insurance products and certain of our investment products, as well as our investment returns and our access to and cost of financing, are sensitive to fixed income, equity, real estate and other market fluctuations and general economic, market and political conditions. These fluctuations and conditions could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and liquidity, including in the following respects:        •    The profitability of many of our insurance products depends in part on the value of the separate accounts supporting these products, which may fluctuate substantially depending on the foregoing conditions.    194    Table of Contents     •    Market conditions resulting in reductions in the value of assets we manage would have an adverse effect on the revenues and profitability of our asset management services, which depend on fees related primarily to the value of assets under management, and would decrease the value of our proprietary investments.        •    A change in market conditions, including prolonged periods of high inflation, could cause a change in consumer sentiment adversely affecting sales and persistency of our long-term savings and protection products. Similarly, changing economic conditions can influence customer behavior including but not limited to increasing claims in certain product lines.        •    Sales of our investment-based and asset management products and services may decline and lapses of variable life and annuity products and withdrawals of assets from other investment products may increase if a market downturn, increased market volatility or other market conditions result in customers becoming dissatisfied with their investments or products.        •    A market decline could result in guaranteed minimum benefits contained in many of our variable annuity products being higher than current account values or our pricing assumptions would support, requiring us to materially increase reserves for such products and may cause customers to retain contracts in force in order to benefit from the guarantees, thereby increasing their cost to us.        •    Market conditions beyond our control determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance protection we purchase. Accordingly, we may be forced to incur additional expenses for reinsurance or may not be able to obtain sufficient reinsurance on acceptable terms which could adversely affect the profitability of future business or our willingness to write future business.        •    Hedging instruments we hold to manage foreign exchange, product, and other risks might not perform as intended or expected resulting in higher realized losses and unforeseen cash needs. Market conditions can also increase the cost of executing product related hedges and such costs may not be recovered in the pricing of the underlying products being hedged. Our hedging strategies rely on the performance of counterparties to such hedges. These counterparties may fail to perform for various reasons resulting in hedge ineffectiveness and higher losses.        •    We have significant investment and derivative portfolios. Adverse capital market conditions, including but not limited to a lack of buyers in the marketplace, volatility, credit spread changes, and benchmark interest rate changes, will impact the liquidity and value of our investments and derivatives, potentially resulting in higher realized or unrealized losses. For example, a widening of credit spreads, such as the market has experienced recently, increases the net unrealized loss position of our investment portfolio and may ultimately result in increased realized losses. Values of our investments and derivatives can also be impacted by reductions in price transparency, changes in assumptions or inputs we use in estimating fair value and changes in investor confidence and preferences, potentially resulting in higher realized or unrealized losses. Volatility can make it difficult to value certain of our securities if trading becomes less frequent. As such, valuations may include assumptions or estimates that may have significant period to period changes which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition.        •    Regardless of market conditions, certain investments we hold, including private bonds and commercial mortgages, are relatively illiquid. If we needed to sell these investments, we may have difficulty doing so in a timely manner at a price that we could otherwise realize.        •    Market conditions could also impact our ability to fund foreseen and unforeseen cash and collateral requirements, potentially inhibiting our ability to perform under our counterparty obligations, support business initiatives and increasing realized losses.    As described above, the adverse market and economic conditions that began in the second half of 2007 have continued and substantially worsened during the third quarter of 2008. The foregoing risks are even more pronounced in these unprecedented market and economic conditions.    195    Table of Contents Interest rate fluctuations could adversely affect our businesses and profitability.    Our insurance products and certain of our investment products, and our investment returns, are sensitive to interest rate fluctuations, and changes in interest rates could adversely affect our investment returns and results of operations, including in the following respects:        •    Some of our products expose us to the risk that changes in interest rates will reduce the spread between the amounts that we are required to pay under the contracts and the rate of return we are able to earn on our general account investments supporting the contracts. When interest rates decline, we have to reinvest the cash income from our investments in lower yielding instruments. Since many of our policies and contracts have guaranteed minimum interest or crediting rates or limit the resetting of interest rates, the spreads could decrease and potentially become negative. When interest rates rise, we may not be able to replace the assets in our general account with the higher yielding assets needed to fund the higher crediting rates necessary to keep these products and contracts competitive. This risk is heightened in the current market and economic environment, in which many desired securities are unavailable.        •    Changes in interest rates may reduce net investment income and thus our spread income which is a substantial portion of our profitability. Changes in interest rates can also result in potential losses in our investment activities in which we borrow funds and purchase investments to earn additional spread income on the borrowed funds. A decline in market interest rates could also reduce our returns from investment of equity.        •    When interest rates rise, policy loans and surrenders and withdrawals of life insurance policies and annuity contracts may increase as policyholders seek to buy products with perceived higher returns, requiring us to sell investment assets potentially resulting in realized investment losses, or requiring us to accelerate the amortization of DAC or VOBA (both defined below).        •    A decline in interest rates accompanied by unexpected prepayments of certain investments could result in reduced investments and a decline in our profitability. An increase in interest rates accompanied by unexpected extensions of certain lower yielding investments could result in a decline in our profitability.        •    Changes in the relationship between long-term and short-term interest rates could adversely affect the profitability of some of our products.        •    Changes in interest rates could increase our costs of financing.        •    Our mitigation efforts with respect to interest rate risk are primarily focused on maintaining an investment portfolio with diversified maturities that has a weighted average duration that is approximately equal to the duration of our estimated liability cash flow profile. However, there are practical and capital market limitations on our ability to accomplish this and our estimate of the liability cash flow profile may be inaccurate. Due to these and other factors we may need to liquidate investments prior to maturity at a loss in order to satisfy liabilities or be forced to reinvest funds in a lower rate environment. Although we take measures to manage the economic risks of investing in a changing interest rate environment, we may not be able to effectively mitigate the interest rate risk of our assets relative to our liabilities.    If our reserves for future policyholder benefits and claims are inadequate, we may be required to increase our reserves, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.    We establish and carry reserves to pay future policyholder benefits and claims. Our reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability, but rather are actuarial or statistical estimates based on models that include many assumptions and projections which are inherently uncertain and involve the exercise of significant judgment, including as to the levels of and/or timing of receipt or payment of premiums, benefits, claims, expenses, interest credits, investment results (including equity market returns), retirement, mortality, morbidity and persistency. We cannot determine with precision the ultimate amounts that we will pay for, or the timing of payment of, actual benefits, claims and expenses or whether the assets supporting our policy liabilities, together with future premiums, will be sufficient for payment of benefits and claims. If we conclude that our reserves,     196    Table of Contents  together with future premiums, are insufficient to cover future policy benefits and claims, we would be required to increase our reserves and incur income statement charges for the period in which we make the determination, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.    For certain of our products, market performance impacts the level of statutory reserves and statutory capital we are required to hold, and may have an adverse effect on returns on capital associated with these products. Capacity for reserve funding structures available in the marketplace is currently limited as a result of market conditions generally. Our ability to efficiently manage capital and economic reserve levels may be impacted, thereby impacting profitability and return on capital.    Our profitability may decline if mortality rates, morbidity rates or persistency rates differ significantly from our pricing expectations.    We set prices for many of our insurance and annuity products based upon expected claims and payment patterns, using assumptions for mortality rates, or likelihood of death, and morbidity rates, or likelihood of sickness, of our policyholders. In addition to the potential effect of natural or man-made disasters, significant changes in mortality or morbidity could emerge gradually over time, due to changes in the natural environment, the health habits of the insured population, treatment patterns for disease or disability, the economic environment, or other factors. Pricing of our insurance and deferred annuity products are also based in part upon expected persistency of these products, which is the probability that a policy or contract will remain in force from one period to the next. Results may also vary based on differences between actual and expected premium deposits and withdrawals for these products. The development of a secondary market for life insurance, including life settlements or “viaticals” and investor owned life insurance, could adversely affect the profitability of existing business and our pricing assumptions for new business. Significant deviations in actual experience from our pricing assumptions could have an adverse effect on the profitability of our products. Although some of our products permit us to increase premiums or adjust other charges and credits during the life of the policy or contract, the adjustments permitted under the terms of the policies or contracts may not be sufficient to maintain profitability. Many of our products do not permit us to increase premiums or adjust other charges and credits or limit those adjustments during the life of the policy or contract.    We may be required to accelerate the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs, or DAC, or valuation of business acquired, or VOBA, or recognize impairment in the value of our goodwill or certain investments, which could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.    Deferred policy acquisition costs, or DAC, represent the costs that vary with and are related primarily to the acquisition of new and renewal insurance and annuity contracts, and we amortize these costs over the expected lives of the contracts. Valuation of business acquired, or VOBA, represents the present value of future profits embedded in acquired insurance, annuity and investment-type contracts and is amortized over the expected effective lives of the acquired contracts. Management, on an ongoing basis, tests the DAC and VOBA recorded on our balance sheet to determine if these amounts are recoverable under current assumptions. In addition, we regularly review the estimates and assumptions underlying DAC and VOBA for those products for which we amortize DAC and VOBA in proportion to gross profits or gross margins. Given changes in facts and circumstances, these tests and reviews could lead to reductions in DAC and/or VOBA that could have an adverse effect on the results of our operations and our financial condition. Significant or sustained equity market declines as well as investment losses could result in an acceleration of amortization of the DAC and VOBA related to variable annuity and variable universal life contracts, resulting in a charge to income.    Goodwill represents the excess of the amounts we paid to acquire subsidiaries and other businesses over the fair value of their net assets at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is assessed annually for potential impairment, or more frequently if conditions warrant, by comparing the carrying value (equity attributed to a business to support its risk) of a business to its estimated fair value at that date. Significant or sustained equity, real estate and other market declines would result in declines in the fair value, or increases in the level of equity required to support, certain of our businesses, including our Annuities business which has $97 million of goodwill at September 30,     197    Table of Contents  2008, our International Investments business which has $131 million of goodwill at September 30, 2008, and our Real Estate and Relocation business which has $118 million of goodwill at September 30, 2008, which in turn could result in an impairment of some or all of the goodwill associated with these businesses, resulting in a charge to income. Additionally, declines in financial markets impact the fair value of certain equity method investments, particularly in our International Investments business, and may require that we review the carrying value of these investments for potential impairment, and such review could result in an impairment and charge to income.    Our valuation of fixed maturity, equity and trading securities may include methodologies, estimations and assumptions that are subject to differing interpretations and could result in changes to investment valuations that may materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.    During periods of market disruption, such as the unprecedented current market conditions, it may be difficult to value certain of our securities, such as sub-prime mortgage backed securities, if trading becomes less frequent and/or market data becomes less observable. There may be certain asset classes that were in active markets with significant observable data that become illiquid due to the current financial environment or market conditions. As a result, valuations may include inputs and assumptions that are less observable or require greater estimation and judgment as well as valuation methods which are more complex. These values may not be ultimately realizable in a market transaction, and such values may change very rapidly as market conditions change and valuation assumptions are modified. Decreases in value may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.    The decision on whether to record an other-than-temporary impairment or write-down is determined in part by management’s assessment of the financial condition and prospects of a particular issuer, projections of future cash flows and recoverability of the particular security as well as an evaluation of the Company’s ability and intent to hold the securities to recovery. Given current market conditions and liquidity concerns, beginning in the third quarter of 2008, our determinations of whether a decline in value is other-than-temporary have placed greater emphasis on our analysis of the underlying credit and our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time to allow for a recovery of value, versus the extent and duration of a decline in value. Management’s conclusions on such assessments may ultimately prove to be incorrect as facts and circumstances change.    For a discussion of certain fixed maturity securities where the estimated fair value has declined and remained below amortized cost by more than 15% but less than 20% and by more than 20%, respectively, see “Realized Investment Gains and Losses and General Account Investments—Unrealized Losses from Fixed Maturity Securities.”    A downgrade or potential downgrade in our claims-paying or credit ratings could limit our ability to market products, increase the number or value of policies being surrendered, increase our borrowing costs and/or hurt our relationships with creditors or trading counterparties.    Claims-paying ratings, which are sometimes referred to as “financial strength” ratings, represent the opinions of rating agencies regarding the financial ability of an insurance company to meet its obligations under an insurance policy, and are important factors affecting public confidence in an insurer and its competitive position in marketing products, including Prudential Insurance and our other insurance company subsidiaries. Credit ratings represent the opinions of rating agencies regarding an entity’s ability to repay its indebtedness, and Prudential Financial’s credit ratings are important to our ability to raise capital through the issuance of debt and to the cost of such financing. A downgrade in our claims-paying or credit ratings could limit our ability to market products, reduce our competitiveness, increase the number or value of policies being surrendered, increase our borrowing costs, adversely affect the availability of financial guarantees, such as letters of credit, cause additional collateral requirements under certain agreements (including our securities lending agreements), and/or hurt our relationships with creditors or trading counterparties.    198    Table of Contents On September 18, September 29, October 2 and October 10, 2008, A.M. Best Company, Inc., Fitch Ratings Ltd., Moody’s Investors Service, and Standard & Poor’s, respectively, each revised its outlook for the U.S. life insurance sector to negative from stable, citing, among other things, the significant deterioration and volatility in the credit and equity markets, economic and political uncertainty, and the expected impact of realized and unrealized investment losses on life insurers’ capital levels and profitability.    In view of the difficulties experienced recently by many financial institutions, we believe that the rating agencies may heighten the level of scrutiny that they apply to such institutions, may increase the frequency and scope of their credit reviews, may request additional information from the companies that they rate, and may adjust upward the capital and other requirements employed in the rating agency models for maintenance of certain ratings levels, such as the AA (Standard & Poor’s) and Aa2 (Moody’s Investors Service) insurer financial strength ratings currently held by our life insurance subsidiaries. The outcome of such a review may have adverse ratings consequences, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operation and financial condition.    We cannot predict what actions rating agencies may take, or what actions we may take in response to the actions of rating agencies, which could adversely affect our business. As with other companies in the financial services industry, our ratings could be downgraded at any time and without notice by any rating agency.    Ratings downgrades and changes in credit spreads may require us to post collateral, thereby affecting our liquidity, and we may be unable to effectively implement certain capital management activities as a result, or for other reasons.    A downgrade in the credit or financial strength ratings of Prudential Financial or its rated subsidiaries could result in additional collateral requirements or other required payments under certain agreements, which are eligible to be satisfied in cash or by posting securities held by the subsidiaries subject to the agreements. A ratings downgrade of three ratings levels would result in estimated collateral posting requirements or payments under such agreements of approximately $175 million. In addition, a ratings downgrade by A.M. Best to A- for our domestic life insurance companies would require Prudential Insurance to post a letter of credit in the amount of $1.25 billion that we estimate would result in annual cash outflows of approximately $125 million, or collateral posting in the form of cash or securities to be held in a trust.    In addition, agreements in connection with capital management activities for our universal life insurance products would require us to post cash collateral based on tests that consider the level of 10-year credit default swap spreads on Prudential Financial’s senior debt. We estimate that the collateral posting requirements would range from $100 million to $200 million at effective 10-year credit default swap spreads of 700 to 2,000 basis points.    The NAIC has adopted a Model Regulation entitled “Valuation of Life Insurance Policies,” commonly known as “Regulation XXX,” and a supporting Guideline entitled “The Application of the Valuation of Life Insurance Policies,” commonly known as “Guideline AXXX.” The Regulation and supporting Guideline require insurers to establish statutory reserves for term and universal life insurance policies with long-term premium guarantees that are consistent with the statutory reserves required for other individual life insurance policies with similar guarantees. Many market participants believe that this level of reserves is excessive, and we have implemented reinsurance and capital management actions to mitigate the impact of Regulation XXX and Guideline AXXX on our term and universal life insurance business. However, we may not be able to implement actions to mitigate the impact of Regulation XXX or Guideline AXXX on future sales of term or universal life insurance products, thereby potentially resulting in an adverse impact on returns on capital associated with these products, and possibly requiring us to reduce our sales of these products or implement measures that may be disruptive to our business.    199    Table of Contents Widening of our credit spreads may adversely affect our ability to execute capital management activities with respect to our term and universal life products.    Losses due to defaults by others, including issuers of investment securities or reinsurance, bond insurers and derivative instrument counterparties, or a downgrade in the ratings of bond insurers, could adversely affect the value of our investments or reduce our profitability.    Issuers and borrowers whose securities or loans we hold, customers, trading counterparties, counterparties under swaps and other derivative contracts, reinsurers, clearing agents, exchanges, clearing houses and other financial intermediaries and guarantors, including bond insurers, may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy, insolvency, lack of liquidity, adverse economic conditions, operational failure, fraud or other reasons. Such defaults, instances of which have occurred in recent months, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. A downgrade in the ratings of bond insurers could also result in declines in the value of our fixed maturity investments supported by guarantees from bond insurers.    In addition, we use derivative instruments to hedge various risks, including certain guaranteed minimum benefits contained in many of our variable products. We enter into a variety of derivative instruments, including options, forwards, interest rate, credit default and currency swaps with a number of counterparties. Our obligations under our variable annuity products are not changed by our hedging activities and we are liable for our obligations even if our derivative counterparties do not pay us. This is a more pronounced risk to us in view of the recent stresses suffered by financial institutions. Such defaults could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.    Intense competition could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our market share or profitability.    In each of our businesses we face intense competition from domestic and foreign insurance companies, asset managers and diversified financial institutions, both for the ultimate customers for our products and, in many businesses, for distribution through non-affiliated distribution channels. We compete based on a number of factors including brand recognition, reputation, quality of service, quality of investment advice, investment performance of our products, product features, scope of distribution and distribution arrangements, price, perceived financial strength and claims-paying and credit ratings. A decline in our competitive position as to one or more of these factors could adversely affect our profitability and assets under management. Many of our competitors are large and well capitalized and some have greater market share or breadth of distribution, offer a broader range of products, services or features, assume a greater level of risk, have lower profitability expectations or have higher claims-paying or credit ratings than we do. We could be subject to claims by competitors that our products infringe their patents, which could adversely affect our sales, profitability and financial position. The proliferation and growth of non-affiliated distribution channels puts pressure on our captive sales channels to increase their productivity and reduce their costs in order to remain competitive, and we run the risk that the marketplace will make a more significant or rapid shift to non-affiliated or direct distribution alternatives than we anticipate or are able to achieve ourselves, potentially adversely affecting our market share and results of operations. Competition for personnel in all of our businesses is intense, including for Prudential Agents, Life Planners and Life Advisors, other face-to-face sales personnel, desirable non-affiliated distribution channels and our investment managers. The loss of personnel could have an adverse effect on our business and profitability.    Changes in U.S. federal income tax law or in the income tax laws of other jurisdictions in which we operate could make some of our products less attractive to consumers and increase our tax costs.    Current U.S. federal income tax laws generally permit certain holders to defer taxation on the build-up of value of annuities and life insurance products until payments are actually made to the policyholder or other beneficiary and to exclude from taxation the death benefit paid under a life insurance contract. Congress from time to time considers legislation that could make our products less attractive to consumers, including legislation     200    Table of Contents  that would reduce or eliminate the benefit of this deferral on some annuities and insurance products, as well as other types of changes that could reduce or eliminate the attractiveness of annuities and life insurance products to consumers, such as repeal of the estate tax.    For example, the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 and the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 generally provide for lower income tax, capital gains and dividend tax rates that had the effect of reducing the benefits of tax deferral on the build-up of value of annuities and life insurance products. Continuation of these reduced rates, which are due to sunset by 2011, may hinder our sales and result in the increased surrender of insurance and annuity products.    Congress, as well as state and local governments, also considers from time to time legislation that could increase the amount of corporate taxes we pay. For example, changes in the law relating to tax reserving methodologies for term life or universal life insurance policies with secondary guarantees could result in higher corporate taxes. If such legislation is adopted our consolidated net income could decline.    The U.S. Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service are addressing the methodology to be followed in determining the dividends received deduction related to variable life insurance and annuity contracts. The dividends received deduction reduces the amount of dividend income subject to tax and is a significant component of the difference between our effective tax rate and the federal statutory tax rate of 35%. A change in the dividends received deduction, including the possible elimination of this deduction through regulations or legislation, could reduce our consolidated net income.    The products we sell have different tax characteristics, in some cases generating tax deductions. Certain of our products are significantly dependent on these characteristics and the Company’s ability to continue to generate taxable income, which are taken into consideration when pricing products and are a component of our capital management strategies. Accordingly, a change in tax law, or other factors impacting the availability of the tax characteristics generated by our products, could impact product pricing and returns.    We have substantial international operations and our international operations face political, legal, operational and other risks that could adversely affect those operations or our profitability.    A substantial portion of our revenues and income from continuing operations is derived from our operations in foreign countries, primarily Japan and Korea. These operations are subject to restrictions on transferring funds out of the countries in which these operations are located. Some of our foreign insurance and investment management operations are, and are likely to continue to be, in emerging markets where this risk as well as risks of discriminatory regulation, labor issues in connection with workers’ associations and trade unions, price controls, currency exchange controls, nationalization or expropriation of assets, are heightened. If our business model is not successful in a particular country, we may lose all or most of our investment in building and training our sales force in that country.    Many of our insurance products sold in international markets provide for the buildup of cash values for the policyholder at contractually fixed guaranteed interest rates, including in Japan. Actual returns on the underlying investments do not necessarily match the guaranteed interest rates and there may be times when the spread between the actual investment returns and these guaranteed rates of return to the policyholder is negative and in which this negative spread may not be offset by the mortality, morbidity and expense charges we earn on the products.    Our international businesses are subject to the tax laws and regulations of the countries in which they are organized and in which they operate. Foreign governments from time to time consider legislation that could increase the amount of taxes that we pay or impact the sales of our products. For example, in March 2007 the Japanese National Tax Authority (“NTA”) indicated that it would change the tax treatment of certain term life products sold to corporations, which resulted in a significant decrease in the sale of Increasing Term Life     201    Table of Contents  insurance to corporations in Japan. The NTA then released a revised tax circular in February 2008 that reduced, but did not eliminate, the corporate tax deductibility of insurance premiums paid with respect to certain Increasing Term insurance products sold after February 28, 2008.    Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect our profitability and cash flow.    We are exposed to foreign currency exchange risks in our general account investment portfolios, other proprietary investment portfolios and through our operations in foreign countries and our hedging programs. Currency fluctuations may adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.    Our businesses are heavily regulated and changes in regulation may reduce our profitability.    Our businesses are subject to comprehensive regulation and supervision. The purpose of this regulation is primarily to protect our customers and not necessarily our shareholders. Many of the laws and regulations to which we are subject, including those to which our international businesses are subject, are regularly re-examined, and existing or future laws and regulations may become more restrictive or otherwise adversely affect our operations. This is particularly the case under current market conditions.    Prudential Financial is subject to the rules and regulations of the SEC and the NYSE relating to public reporting and disclosure, securities trading, accounting and financial reporting, and corporate governance matters. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and rules and regulations adopted in furtherance of that Act have substantially increased the requirements in these and other areas for public companies such as Prudential Financial.    Many insurance regulatory and other governmental or self-regulatory bodies have the authority to review our products and business practices and those of our agents and employees and to bring regulatory or other legal actions against us if, in their view, our practices, or those of our agents or employees, are improper. These actions can result in substantial fines, penalties or prohibitions or restrictions on our business activities and could adversely affect our business, reputation, results of operations or financial condition. For a discussion of material pending litigation and regulatory matters, see “Contingent Liabilities and Litigation and Regulatory Matters” in the Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.    Congress from time to time considers pension reform legislation that could decrease the attractiveness of certain of our retirement products and services to retirement plan sponsors and administrators, or have an unfavorable effect on our ability to earn revenues from these products and services. In this regard, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (“PPA”) makes significant changes in employer pension funding obligations associated with defined benefit pension plans which are likely to increase sponsors’ costs of maintaining these plans. These changes could hinder our sales of defined benefit pension products and services and cause sponsors to discontinue existing plans for which we provide asset management, administrative, or other services, but could increase the attractiveness of certain group annuity products we offer in connection with terminating pension plans. The Bush Administration also has proposed several tax-favored savings initiatives. These initiatives could hinder sales and persistency of our products and services that support employment based retirement plans.    Insurance regulators, as well as industry participants, have also begun to consider potentially significant changes in the way in which statutory reserves and statutory capital are determined, particularly for products with embedded options and guarantees. New regulatory capital requirements have already gone into effect for variable annuity products. The timing of, and extent of, such changes to the statutory reporting framework are uncertain; however, the result could be increases to statutory reserves and capital, and an adverse effect on our products, sales and operating costs.    In view of recent events involving certain financial institutions, it is possible that the U.S. federal government will heighten its oversight of companies in the financial services industry such as us, including     202    Table of Contents  possibly through a federal system of insurance regulation. We cannot predict whether this or other proposals will be adopted, or what impact, if any, such proposals or, if enacted, such laws, could have on our business, financial condition or results of operations.    Compliance with applicable laws and regulations is time consuming and personnel-intensive, and changes in these laws and regulations may materially increase our direct and indirect compliance and other expenses of doing business, thus having a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.    See “Business—Regulation” in our 2007 Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of the impact of regulations on our businesses.    Legal and regulatory actions are inherent in our businesses and could adversely affect our results of operations or financial position or harm our businesses or reputation.    We are, and in the future may be, subject to legal and regulatory actions in the ordinary course of our businesses, including in businesses that we have divested or placed in wind-down status. Some of these proceedings have been brought on behalf of various alleged classes of complainants. In certain of these matters, the plaintiffs are seeking large and/or indeterminate amounts, including punitive or exemplary damages. Substantial legal liability in these or future legal or regulatory actions could have an adverse affect on us or cause us reputational harm, which in turn could harm our business prospects.    Material pending litigation and regulatory matters affecting us, and certain risks to our businesses presented by such matters, are discussed under “Contingent Liabilities and Litigation and Regulatory Matters” in the Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Our litigation and regulatory matters are subject to many uncertainties, and given their complexity and scope, their outcome cannot be predicted. Our reserves for litigation and regulatory matters may prove to be inadequate. It is possible that our results of operations or cash flow in a particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by an ultimate unfavorable resolution of pending litigation and regulatory matters depending, in part, upon the results of operations or cash flow for such period. In light of the unpredictability of the Company’s litigation and regulatory matters, it is also possible that in certain cases an ultimate unfavorable resolution of one or more pending litigation or regulatory matters could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position.    The occurrence of natural or man-made disasters could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.    The occurrence of natural disasters, including hurricanes, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, fires, explosions, pandemic disease and man-made disasters, including acts of terrorism and military actions, could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition, including in the following respects:        •    Catastrophic loss of life due to natural or man-made disasters could cause us to pay benefits at higher levels and/or materially earlier than anticipated and could lead to unexpected changes in persistency rates.        •    A natural or man-made disaster could result in losses in our investment portfolio or the failure of our counterparties to perform, or cause significant volatility in global financial markets.        •    A terrorist attack affecting financial institutions in the United States or elsewhere could negatively impact the financial services industry in general and our business operations, investment portfolio and profitability in particular. As previously reported, in August 2004, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security identified our Newark, New Jersey facilities, along with those of several other financial institutions in New York and Washington, D.C., as possible targets of a terrorist attack.        •    Pandemic disease, caused by a virus such as H5N1 (the “Avian flu” virus), could have a severe adverse effect on Prudential Financial’s business. The potential impact of such a pandemic on Prudential Financial’s results of operations and financial position is highly speculative, and would depend on     203    Table of Contents       numerous factors, including: the probability of the virus mutating to a form that can be passed from human to human; the rate of contagion if and when that occurs; the regions of the world most affected; the effectiveness of treatment for the infected population; the rates of mortality and morbidity among various segments of the insured versus the uninsured population; the collectibility of reinsurance; the possible macroeconomic effects of a pandemic on the Company’s asset portfolio; the effect on lapses and surrenders of existing policies, as well as sales of new policies; and many other variables.    There can be no assurance that our business continuation plans and insurance coverages would be effective in mitigating any negative effects on our operations or profitability in the event of a terrorist attack or other disaster.    Our risk management policies and procedures and our minority investments in joint ventures may leave us exposed to unidentified or unanticipated risk, which could adversely affect our businesses or result in losses.    Our policies and procedures to monitor and manage risks, including hedging programs that utilize derivative financial instruments, may not be fully effective and may leave us exposed to unidentified and unanticipated risks. The Company uses models in its hedging programs and many other aspects of its operations, including but not limited to the estimation of actuarial reserves, the amortization of deferred acquisition costs and the value of business acquired, and the valuation of certain other assets and liabilities. These models rely on assumptions and projections that are inherently uncertain. Management of operational, legal and regulatory risks requires, among other things, policies and procedures to record properly and verify a large number of transactions and events, and these policies and procedures may not be fully effective. Past or future misconduct by our employees or employees of our vendors could result in violations of law by us, regulatory sanctions and/or serious reputational or financial harm and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases. A failure of our computer systems or a compromise of their security could also subject us to regulatory sanctions or other claims, harm our reputation, interrupt our operations and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.    In our investments in which we hold a minority interest, including Wachovia Securities Financial Holdings, LLC, we lack management and operational control over its operations, which may prevent us from taking or causing to be taken actions to protect or increase the value of those investments.    We face risks arising from acquisitions, divestitures and restructurings, including client losses, surrenders and withdrawals, difficulties in integrating and realizing the projected results of acquisitions and contingent liabilities with respect to dispositions.    We face a number of risks arising from acquisition transactions, including the risk that, following the acquisition or reorganization of a business, we could experience client losses, surrenders or withdrawals materially different from those we anticipate, as well as difficulties in integrating and realizing the projected results of acquisitions and restructurings and managing the litigation and regulatory matters to which acquired entities are party. We have retained insurance or reinsurance obligations and other contingent liabilities in connection with our divestiture or winding down of various businesses, including with respect to the retail securities brokerage and securities clearing operations that we contributed to the joint venture with Wachovia Corporation, and our reserves for these obligations and liabilities may prove to be inadequate. These risks may adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.    Changes in our discount rate, expected rate of return and expected compensation increase assumptions for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans may result in increased expenses and reduce our profitability.    We determine our pension and other postretirement benefit plan costs based on assumed discount rates, expected rates of return on plan assets and expected increases in compensation levels and trends in health care costs. Changes in these assumptions may result in increased expenses and reduce our profitability.    204    Table of Contents Our ability to pay shareholder dividends, to engage in share repurchases and to meet obligations may be adversely affected by limitations imposed on inter-affiliate distributions and transfers by Prudential Insurance and our other subsidiaries.    Prudential Financial is the holding company for all our operations, and dividends, returns of capital and interest income from its subsidiaries are the principal source of funds available to Prudential Financial to pay shareholder dividends, to make share repurchases and to meet its other obligations. These sources of funds are complemented by Prudential Financial’s access to the financial markets and bank facilities. As described under “Business—Regulation” in our 2007 Annual Report on Form 10-K and in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources” in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our domestic and foreign insurance and various other subsidiary companies, including Prudential Insurance, are subject to regulatory limitations on the payment of dividends and on other transfers of funds to Prudential Financial. In addition to these regulatory limitations, the terms of the IHC debt contain restrictions potentially limiting dividends by Prudential Insurance applicable to the Financial Services Businesses in the event the Closed Block Business is in financial distress and under other circumstances. These restrictions on Prudential Financial’s subsidiaries may limit such subsidiaries from making dividend payments to Prudential Financial in an amount sufficient to fund Prudential Financial’s cash requirements and shareholder dividends. From time to time, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, or NAIC, and various state and foreign insurance regulators have considered, and may in the future consider, proposals to further limit dividend payments that an insurance company may make without regulatory approval.    Difficult market conditions also affect our ability to pay shareholder dividends and to engage in share repurchases. We announced on October 9, 2008, that in light of recent market volatility and extraordinary events and developments affecting financial markets generally, we determined to suspend purchases of Common Stock under the existing share repurchase program, effective October 10, 2008.    Regulatory requirements, provisions of our certificate of incorporation and by-laws and our shareholder rights plan could delay, deter or prevent a takeover attempt that shareholders might consider in their best interests.    Various states in which our insurance companies are domiciled, including New Jersey, must approve any direct or indirect change of control of insurance companies organized in those states. Under most states’ statutes, an entity is presumed to have control of an insurance company if it owns, directly or indirectly, 10% or more of the voting stock of that insurance company or its parent company. Federal, and in some cases, state, banking authorities would also have to approve the indirect change of control of our banking operations. The federal securities laws could also require reapproval by customers of our investment advisory contracts to manage mutual funds, including mutual funds included in annuity products, upon a change in control. In addition, the New Jersey Business Corporation Act prohibits certain business combinations with interested shareholders. These regulatory and other restrictions may delay a potential merger or sale of Prudential Financial, even if the Board of Directors decides that it is in the best interests of shareholders to merge or be sold.    Prudential Financial’s certificate of incorporation and by-laws also contain provisions that may delay, deter or prevent a takeover attempt that shareholders might consider in their best interests. These provisions may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our Common Stock and include: a restriction on the filling of vacancies on the Board of Directors by shareholders; restrictions on the calling of special meetings by shareholders; a requirement that shareholders may take action without a meeting only by unanimous written consent; advance notice procedures for the nomination of candidates to the Board of Directors and shareholder proposals to be considered at shareholder meetings; and supermajority voting requirements for the amendment of certain provisions of the certificate of incorporation and by-laws. Prudential Financial’s shareholders rights plan also creates obstacles that may delay, deter or prevent a takeover attempt that shareholders might consider in their best interests.    205    Table of Contents Holders of our Common Stock are subject to risks due to the issuance of our Class B Stock, a second class of common stock.    The businesses of Prudential Financial are separated into the Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business, and our Common Stock reflects the performance of the Financial Services Businesses and the Class B Stock reflects the performance of the Closed Block Business. There are a number of risks to holders of our Common Stock by virtue of this dual common stock structure, including:        •    Even though we allocate all our consolidated assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and cash flow between the Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business for financial statement purposes, there is no legal separation between the Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business. Holders of Common Stock have no interest in a separate legal entity representing the Financial Services Businesses; holders of the Class B Stock have no interest in a separate legal entity representing the Closed Block Business; and therefore holders of each class of common stock are subject to all of the risks associated with an investment in the Company.        •    The financial results of the Closed Block Business, including debt service on the IHC debt, will affect Prudential Financial’s consolidated results of operations, financial position and borrowing costs.        •    The market value of our Common Stock may not reflect solely the performance of the Financial Services Businesses.        •    We cannot pay cash dividends on our Common Stock for any period if we choose not to pay dividends on the Class B Stock in an aggregate amount at least equal to the lesser of the CB Distributable Cash Flow or the Target Dividend Amount on the Class B Stock for that period. See “Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities—Convertibility” for the definition of these terms. Any net losses of the Closed Block Business, and any dividends or distributions on, or repurchases of the Class B Stock, would reduce the assets of Prudential Financial legally available for dividends on the Common Stock.        •    Net income for the Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business includes general and administrative expenses charged to each of the respective Businesses based on the Company’s methodology for the allocation of such expenses. Cash flows to the Financial Services Businesses from the Closed Block Business related to administrative expenses are determined by a policy servicing fee arrangement that is based upon insurance and policies in force and statutory cash premiums. The difference between the administrative expenses allocated to the Closed Block Business and these cash flow amounts are recorded, on an after tax basis, as direct equity adjustments to the equity balances of the businesses and included in the determination of earnings per share for each Business. A change in cash flow amounts between the Businesses that is inconsistent with changes in general and administrative expenses we incur will affect the earnings per share of the Common Stock and Class B Stock.        •    Holders of Common Stock and Class B Stock vote together as a single class of common stock under New Jersey law, except as otherwise required by law and except that the holders of the Class B Stock have class voting or consent rights with respect to specified matters directly affecting the Class B Stock.        •    Shares of Class B Stock are entitled to a higher proportionate amount upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of Prudential Financial, than shares of Common Stock.        •    We may exchange the Class B Stock for shares of Common Stock at any time, and the Class B Stock is mandatorily exchangeable in the event of a sale of all or substantially all of the Closed Block Business or a “change of control” of Prudential Financial. Under these circumstances, shares of Class B Stock would be exchanged for shares of Common Stock with an aggregate average market value equal to 120% of the then appraised “Fair Market Value” of the Class B Stock. For a description of “change of control” and “Fair Market Value”, see “Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities—Convertibility.” Holders of Class B Stock may at their discretion, beginning in 2016, and at any time in the event of specified regulatory events, convert their shares of Class B Stock into shares of Common Stock with an aggregate average market value     206    Table of Contents       equal to 100% of the then appraised Fair Market Value of the Class B Stock. Any exchange or conversion could occur at a time when either or both of the Common Stock and Class B Stock may be considered overvalued or undervalued. Accordingly, any such exchange or conversion may be disadvantageous to holders of Common Stock.        •    Our Board of Directors has adopted certain policies regarding inter-business transfers and accounting and tax matters, including the allocation of earnings, with respect to the Financial Services Businesses and Closed Block Business. Although the Board of Directors may change any of these policies, any such decision is subject to the Board of Directors’ general fiduciary duties, and we have agreed with investors in the Class B Stock and the insurer of the IHC debt that, in most cases, the Board of Directors may not change these policies without their consent.    Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
