Item 1A. Risk Factors,” as well as those factors summarized below: · sustained or further declines in the prices we receive for our oil and natural gas; · uncertainties about the estimated quantities of oil and natural gas reserves; · drilling and operating risks, including risks related to properties where we do not serve as the operator and risks related to hydraulic fracturing activities; · the adequacy of our capital resources and liquidity including, but not limited to, access to additional borrowing capacity under our credit facility; · the effects of government regulation, permitting and other legal requirements, including new legislation or regulation of hydraulic fracturing; · difficult and adverse conditions in the domestic and global capital and credit markets; · risks related to the concentration of our operations in the Permian Basin of Southeast New Mexico and West Texas; · shortages of oilfield equipment, supplies, services and qualified personnel and increased costs for such equipment, supplies, services and personnel; · potential financial losses or earnings reductions from our commodity price management program; · risks and liabilities associated with acquired properties or businesses; · uncertainties about our ability to successfully execute our business and financial plans and strategies; · uncertainties about our ability to replace reserves and economically develop our current reserves; · general economic and business conditions, either internationally or domestically or in the jurisdictions in which we operate; · competition in the oil and natural gas industry; and · uncertainty concerning our assumed or possible future results of operations. Reserve engineering is a process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact way. The accuracy of any reserve estimate depends on the quality of available data, the interpretation of such data and price and cost assumptions made by our reserve engineers. In addition, the results of drilling, testing and production activities may justify revisions of estimates that were made previously. If significant, such revisions would change the schedule of any further production and development drilling. Accordingly, reserve estimates may differ from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered.      iv            PART I   Item 1. Business    General   Concho Resources Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Concho,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” and “our”) formed in February 2006, is an independent oil and natural gas company engaged in the acquisition, development and exploration of oil and natural gas properties. Our core operating areas are located in the Permian Basin region of Southeast New Mexico and West Texas, a large onshore oil and natural gas basin in the United States. The Permian Basin is one of the most prolific oil and natural gas producing regions in the United States and is characterized by an extensive production history, long reserve life, multiple producing horizons and enhanced recovery potential. We refer to our three core operating areas as the (i) New Mexico Shelf, where we primarily target the Yeso formation, (ii) Delaware Basin, where we primarily target the Bone Spring formation (including the Avalon shale and the Bone Spring sands) and the Wolfcamp shale, and (iii) Texas Permian, where we primarily target the Wolfberry, a term applied to the combined Wolfcamp and Spraberry horizons. We intend to grow our reserves and production through development drilling and exploration activities on our multi-year project inventory and through acquisitions that meet our strategic and financial objectives.   Acquisitions   Three Rivers Acquisition    In July 2012, we completed an acquisition of producing and non-producing assets from Three Rivers Operating Company LLC and certain affiliated entities (the “Three Rivers Acquisition”) for cash consideration of approximately $1.0 billion. We estimated that the Three Rivers Acquisition had approximately 45.5 MMBoe of proved reserves at closing. The Three Rivers Acquisition was primarily funded with borrowings under our credit facility.   PDC Acquisition    In February 2012, we completed an acquisition of producing and non-producing assets in the Wolfberry trend in the Permian Basin from Petroleum Development Corporation (the “PDC Acquisition”) for approximately $189.2 million in cash. We estimated that the PDC Acquisition had approximately 9.8 MMBoe of proved reserves at closing. The PDC Acquisition was primarily funded with borrowings under our credit facility.   Delaware Basin Acquisitions   OGX Acquisition. In November 2011, we acquired three entities affiliated with OGX Holdings II, LLC (collectively the “OGX Acquisition”) for cash consideration of approximately $252.0 million. The OGX Acquisition consisted of producing and non-producing acreage in the Delaware Basin of Southeast New Mexico and West Texas. We estimate that the OGX Acquisition contained approximately 5.7 MMBoe of proved reserves at closing. The OGX Acquisition was primarily funded with borrowings under our credit facility.    Other Delaware Basin Acquisitions. In the third and fourth quarters of 2011, in four acquisitions, we acquired for approximately $79.0 million in cash additional non-producing acreage in the Delaware Basin. These acquisitions were primarily funded with borrowings under our credit facility. We collectively refer to these acquisitions and the OGX Acquisition as the “Delaware Basin Acquisitions.”   Marbob and Settlement Acquisitions   In July 2010, we entered into an asset purchase agreement to acquire certain of the oil and natural gas leases, interests, properties and related assets owned by Marbob Energy Corporation and its affiliates (collectively, “Marbob”) for aggregate consideration of (i) cash in the amount of $1.45 billion, (ii) the issuance to Marbob of a $150 million 8.0% senior note due 2018, which was repaid in May   1             of 2011 with borrowings under our credit facility, and (iii) the issuance to Marbob of approximately 1.1 million shares of our common stock, subject to purchase price adjustments, which included downward purchase price adjustments based on the exercise by third parties of contractual preferential purchase rights in properties to be acquired from Marbob (the “Marbob Acquisition”).    On October 7, 2010, we closed the Marbob Acquisition. At closing, we paid approximately $1.1 billion in cash plus the senior note and common stock described above for a total purchase price of approximately $1.4 billion. The total purchase price as originally announced was reduced due to third party contractual preferential purchase rights in the Marbob properties. Certain of the third parties’ contractual preferential purchase rights became subject to litigation.    We funded the cash consideration in the Marbob Acquisition with (a) borrowings under our credit facility and (b) net proceeds of $292.7 million from a private placement of approximately 6.6 million shares of our common stock at a price of $45.30 per share that closed on October 7, 2010.    On October 15, 2010, we resolved the litigation related to the disputed contractual preferential purchase rights. As a result of the settlement, we acquired a non-operated interest in substantially all of the oil and natural gas assets subject to the litigation for approximately $286 million in cash (the “Settlement Acquisition”). We funded the Settlement Acquisition with borrowings under our credit facility.   The properties acquired in the Marbob and Settlement Acquisitions are primarily located in the Permian Basin of Southeast New Mexico, including a large acreage position contiguous to our core Yeso play on the southeast New Mexico Shelf and a significant acreage position in the Delaware Basin. We estimate that the assets acquired in the Marbob and Settlement Acquisitions contained approximately 72.4 MMBoe of proved reserves at closing.    Divestitures   In December 2012, we sold certain of our non-core assets, some of which were acquired in the Three Rivers Acquisition, for cash consideration of approximately $488.1 million, subject to customary post-closing adjustments, and recognized a pre-tax loss on the disposition of assets (included in discontinued operations) of approximately $18.7 million. For the year ended December 31, 2012, these assets produced an average of 4,937 Boe per day, which was approximately 63 percent oil. We estimate that the proved reserves of these assets at closing were approximately 35.3 MMBoe.   In March 2011, we sold our Bakken assets for cash consideration of approximately $195.9 million and recognized a pre-tax gain on the disposition of assets (included in discontinued operations) of approximately $135.9 million. For the first quarter of 2011, these assets produced an average of 1,369 Boe per day. We estimate that the proved reserves of the Bakken assets at closing were approximately 8.4 MMBoe.    In December 2010, we sold certain of our non-core Permian Basin assets for cash consideration of approximately $103.3 million and recognized a pre-tax gain on the disposition of assets (included in discontinued operations) of approximately $29.1 million. For 2010, these assets produced an average of 1,393 Boe per day. We estimate that the proved reserves of these assets at closing were approximately 6.0 MMBoe.    Business and Properties   Our core operations are focused in the Permian Basin of Southeast New Mexico and West Texas. It underlies an area of Southeast New Mexico and West Texas approximately 250 miles wide and 300 miles long. Commercial accumulations of hydrocarbons occur in multiple stratigraphic horizons, at depths ranging from approximately 1,000 feet to over 25,000 feet. At December 31, 2012, substantially all of our 447.2 MMBoe total estimated proved reserves were located in our core operating areas and consisted of approximately 61.2 percent oil and 38.8 percent natural gas. We have assembled a multi-year inventory of development drilling and exploration projects, including projects to further evaluate (i) the areal extent of the Yeso formation and the Wolfberry play and (ii) the Bone Spring and Wolfcamp formations in the Delaware Basin, which we believe will allow us to grow our proved reserves and production.  2               We continually evaluate opportunities that could develop into an emerging play. We view an emerging play as an area where we can acquire large undeveloped acreage positions and apply horizontal drilling and/or advanced fracture stimulation technologies to achieve economic and repeatable production results. We have assembled an exploration team to target such emerging plays.   The following table sets forth information with respect to drilling of wells commenced during the periods indicated:                                                                                        Years Ended December 31,                 2012            2011            2010                                                                Gross wells .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................             840             810             662      Net wells .........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................             519             574             402      .......................................................................................................................................    .......................................................................................................................................    .......................................................................................................................................    .......................................................................................................................................    .......................................................................................................................................

We will continue to evaluate converting our identified vertical locations to horizontal opportunities, where possible. We believe horizontal drilling is more capital efficient than vertical drilling, in many situations. In 2013, we plan to spend approximately $900 million of our $1.4 billion drilling and completion costs budget on horizontal drilling opportunities.   We produced approximately 29.8 MMBoe, 23.6 MMBoe and 15.6 MMBoe of oil and natural gas during 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Included in those production amounts are 1,807 MBoe, 1,679 MBoe and 2,345 MBoe of production related to our discontinued operations during 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. In addition, we increased our average daily production from 66.2 MBoe during the fourth quarter of 2011 to 84.7 MBoe during the fourth quarter of 2012. During 2012, we increased our total estimated proved reserves by approximately 60.7 MMBoe, after giving effect to (i) acquisitions of 56.5 MMBoe and (ii) sales of minerals-in-place of 35.3 MMBoe.  3             Summary of Core Operating Areas and Other Plays   The following is a summary of information regarding our core operating areas and other plays that are further described below:                                                                                                        December 31, 2012       Year Ended                                                                                         December 31,                 Estimated                                   Gross                           2012 Average                 Proved                                   Identified           Total        Total        Daily                      Reserves           PV-10                   % Proved       Drilling           Gross       Net       Production         Areas       (MBoe)           ($ in millions)           % Oil       Developed       Locations           Acreage       Acreage       (Boe per Day)                                                                                                   Core Operating Areas:                                                                                     New Mexico Shelf ...................................................................................................................................................................................................................................         224,368        $    4,642.2            64.8%       70.2%        2,083             228,936         103,814         38,925              Delaware Basin .......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................         81,744             1,396.8            48.2%       52.4%        4,212             476,223         315,742         21,043              Texas Permian ........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................         140,959             2,287.0            62.9%       50.7%        5,974             426,601         155,490         21,331          Other ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................         117             1.0            5.5%       100.0%        -             73,579         51,146         33              Total .......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................         447,188        $    8,327.0    (a)   61.2%       60.8%        12,269    (b)    1,205,339         626,192         81,332    (c)                                                                                                                                                                                          (a) Our Standardized Measure at December 31, 2012 was $5.8 billion. The present value of estimated future net revenues discounted at an annual rate of 10 percent (“PV-10”) is not a GAAP financial measure and is derived from the Standardized Measure, which is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. PV-10 is a computation of the Standardized Measure on a pre-tax basis. PV-10 is equal to the Standardized Measure at the applicable date, before deducting future income taxes, discounted at 10 percent. We believe that the presentation of PV-10 is relevant and useful to investors because it presents the discounted future net cash flows attributable to our estimated proved reserves prior to taking into account future corporate income taxes, and it is a useful measure for evaluating the relative monetary significance of our oil and natural gas assets. Further, investors may utilize the measure as a basis for comparison of the relative size and value of our reserves to other companies. We use this measure when assessing the potential return on investment related to our oil and natural gas assets. PV-10, however, is not a substitute for the Standardized Measure. Our PV-10 measure and the Standardized Measure do not purport to present the fair value of our oil and natural gas reserves. See “Item 1. Business —Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Reconciliations.”   (b) Of the 12,269 gross identified drilling locations, 2,326 locations were associated with proved reserves.   (c) Includes production of 1,807 MBoe (an average of 4,937 Boe per day for the year) for the non-core assets divested in December 2012. __________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________   Core operating areas   New Mexico Shelf. This area represents our most significant concentration of assets and, at December 31, 2012, we had estimated proved reserves in this area of 224.4 MMBoe, representing 50.2 percent of our total proved reserves and 55.7 percent of our PV-10.   Within this area our primary objectives are the Yeso, San Andres and Grayburg formations, with producing depths ranging from approximately 900 feet to 7,500 feet. We have drilled and plan to continue to evaluate drilling horizontally in the Yeso. During 2012, we continued our development of the Yeso formation on 10 acre spacing.   During the year ended December 31, 2012, we commenced drilling or participated in the drilling of 360 (257 net) wells in this area, of which 298 (223 net) wells were completed as producers, 2 (1 net) wells were unsuccessful and 60 (33 net) wells were in various stages of drilling and completion at December 31, 2012. During 2012, approximately 18 percent of the wells we commenced or participated in drilling were drilled horizontally.   At December 31, 2012, we had 228,936 gross (103,814 net) acres in this area. At December 31, 2012, on our assets in this area, we had identified 2,083 (1,401 net) drilling locations, with proved reserves attributed to 616 (457 net) of such locations. Of these 2,083 drilling locations, 1,044 locations target the Yeso formation vertically and 676 locations target the Yeso formation horizontally.   In 2013, we plan to spend approximately $285 million, or 21 percent, of our 2013 capital budget on drilling and completion costs on the New Mexico Shelf assets, with which we expect to drill 190 (116 net) wells. In 2013, we expect that approximately 31 percent of these wells will be drilled horizontally.   Delaware Basin. At December 31, 2012, we had estimated proved reserves in the Delaware Basin of 81.7 MMBoe, representing  18.3 percent of our total proved reserves and 16.8 percent of our PV-10.  4               Within this area, we utilize horizontal drilling and fracturing technologies to target the oil-prone Bone Spring formation that includes three Bone Spring sandstone members, the Avalon shale member and the Wolfcamp shale. These formations produce from 4,700 feet to 13,500 feet for our currently targeted activity. Within the Delaware Basin, we have drilled and are also actively evaluating the Delaware sands and Penn shale opportunities on our acreage.   During the year ended December 31, 2012, we commenced drilling or participated in the drilling of 154 (76 net) wells in this area, of which 107 (51 net) wells were completed as producers, 2 (2 net) wells were unsuccessful and 45 (23 net) wells were in various stages of drilling and completion at December 31, 2012. During 2012, we continued (i) our development and step-out activity on the Avalon shale, Bone Spring sands and Wolfcamp shale and (ii) evaluation of our fracture stimulation procedures in the completion of certain horizontal wells. During 2012, approximately 99% of the wells we commenced or participated in drilling were drilled horizontally.   At December 31, 2012, we had 476,223 gross (315,742 net) acres in this area. At December 31, 2012, we had identified 4,212 (1,949 net) drilling locations, with proved reserves attributed to 246 (128 net) of such locations. These locations include 2,462 targeting the Bone Spring sands, 1,016 targeting the Avalon shale and 734 targeting other formations.   In 2013, we plan to spend approximately $725 million, or 54 percent, of our 2013 capital budget on drilling and completion costs on the Delaware Basin assets, with which we expect to drill 175 (99 net) wells. In 2013, we expect that approximately 95 percent of these wells will be drilled horizontally.   Texas Permian. At December 31, 2012, our estimated proved reserves of 141.0 MMBoe in this area accounted for 31.5 percent of our total proved reserves and 27.5 percent of our PV-10 value.   Our primary objective in the Texas Permian area is the Wolfberry in the Midland Basin. “Wolfberry” is the term applied to the combined production from the Spraberry and Wolfcamp horizons out of vertical wellbores, which are typically encountered at depths of 7,500 feet to 10,500 feet. These formations are comprised of a sequence of basinal, interbedded sands, shales and carbonates. On our Texas Permian assets we are continuing to evaluate (i) our 20-acre downspacing on the Wolfberry assets, (ii) the potential of horizontal Wolfcamp drilling and (iii) the other potential zones on our acreage, such as the Cline shale (a Pennsylvanian age formation).   At December 31, 2012, we had 426,601 gross (155,490 net) acres in this area. In addition, at December 31, 2012, we had identified 5,974 (3,638 net) drilling locations, with proved reserves attributed to 1,464 (749 net) of such drilling locations. Of these 5,974 drilling locations, 1,955 target the Wolfberry play through 40-acre spacing, 2,486 target the Wolfberry play on 20-acre spacing, 1,410 target the shallow Wolfcamp vertically and the remaining drilling locations target other objectives.     During 2012, we commenced drilling or participated in the drilling of 326 (186 net) wells in this area, of which 270 (153 net) wells were completed as producers, 1 (1 net) well was unsuccessful and 55 (32 net) wells were in various stages of drilling and completion at December 31, 2012. During 2012, approximately 2 percent of the wells we commenced or participated in drilling were drilled horizontally.   In 2013, we plan to spend approximately $342 million, or 25 percent, of our 2013 capital budget on drilling and completion costs on the Texas Permian assets, with which we expect to drill 266 (165 net) wells. In 2013, we expect that approximately 3 percent of these wells will be drilled horizontally.  5             Drilling Activities   The following table sets forth information with respect to (i) wells drilled and completed during the periods indicated and (ii) wells drilled in a prior period but completed in the periods indicated. The information should not be considered indicative of future performance, nor should a correlation be assumed between the number of productive wells drilled, quantities of reserves found or economic value.

The table below excludes production and operating data that we have classified as discontinued operations, which is more fully described in Note N of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” The actual historical data in this table excludes results from the (i) Three Rivers Acquisition for periods prior to July 2012, (ii) PDC Acquisition for periods prior to March 2012, (iii) OGX Acquisition for periods prior to December 2011 and (iv) Marbob and Settlement Acquisitions for periods prior to their respective close dates in October 2010. Because of normal production declines, increased or decreased drilling activities and the effects of acquisitions or divestitures, the historical information presented below should not be interpreted as being indicative of future results.

We market our oil and natural gas in accordance with standard energy practices. The marketing effort is coordinated with our operations group as it relates to the planning and preparation of future drilling programs so that available markets can be assessed and secured. This planning also involves the coordination of access to the physical facilities necessary to connect new producing wells as efficiently as possible upon their completion.   Oil. We do not transport, refine or process the oil we produce. A significant portion of our oil in Southeast New Mexico, primarily on the New Mexico Shelf, is connected directly to oil gathering pipelines. Most of our gathered oil in this area is utilized in a two-refinery complex in Southeast New Mexico. A significant portion of our West Texas production is on pipeline. Most of this production is sweet crude and is transported by third parties to the Cushing, Oklahoma hub. The balance of our oil in these areas that is not directly connected to pipeline is (i) trucked to unloading stations on those same pipelines or (ii) railed to the Gulf Coast in lieu of transporting by pipeline. We sell the majority of the oil we produce under contracts using market-based pricing. This price is then adjusted for differentials based upon delivery location and oil quality.   Natural Gas. We consider all natural gas gathering and delivery infrastructure in the areas of our production and evaluate market options to obtain the best price reasonably available under the circumstances. We sell the majority of our natural gas under individually negotiated natural gas purchase contracts using market-based pricing. The majority of our natural gas is subject to term agreements that extend at least three years from the date of the subject contract.   The majority of the natural gas we sell is casinghead gas sold at the lease under a percentage of proceeds processing contract. The purchaser gathers our casinghead natural gas in the field where it is produced and transports it via pipeline to a natural gas processing plant where the natural gas liquid products are extracted and sold by the processor. The remaining natural gas product is residue gas, or dry gas, which is placed on residue pipeline systems available in the area. Under our percentage of proceeds contracts, we receive a percentage of the value for the extracted liquids and the residue gas. In a limited number of cases (typically dry gas production), the natural gas gathering and transportation is performed by a third party gathering company which transports the production from the production location to the purchaser’s mainline.   Our Principal Customers   We sell our oil and natural gas production principally to marketers and other purchasers that have access to pipeline facilities. In areas where there is no practical access to pipelines, oil is transported to storage facilities by trucks and rail owned or otherwise arranged by the marketers or purchasers. Our marketing of oil and natural gas can be affected by factors beyond our control, the effects of which cannot be accurately predicted.   For 2012, revenues from oil and natural gas sales to Holly Frontier Refining and Marketing, LLC and Phillips 66 (formerly the ConocoPhillips Company) accounted for approximately 26 percent and 14 percent, respectively, of our total operating revenues. While the loss of either of these purchasers may result in a temporary interruption in sales of, or a lower price for, our production, we believe that the loss of any of these purchasers would not have a material adverse effect on our operations, as there are alternative purchasers in our producing regions.   Competition   The oil and natural gas industry in the regions in which we operate is highly competitive. We encounter strong competition from numerous parties, ranging generally from small independent producers to major integrated companies. We primarily encounter significant competition in acquiring properties, contracting for drilling, pressure pumping and workover equipment and securing trained personnel. Many of these competitors have financial and technical resources and staffs substantially larger than ours. As a result, our competitors may be able to pay more for desirable properties, or to evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties or prospects than our financial or personnel resources will permit.    9             In addition to competition for drilling, pressure pumping and workover equipment, we are also affected by the availability of related equipment and materials. The oil and natural gas industry periodically experiences shortages of drilling and workover rigs, equipment, pipe, materials and personnel, which can delay drilling, workover and exploration activities and cause significant price increases. The shortages of personnel make it difficult to attract and retain personnel with experience in the oil and natural gas industry and caused us to increase our general and administrative budget. We are unable to predict the timing or duration of any such shortages.   Competition is also strong for attractive oil and natural gas producing properties, undeveloped leases and drilling rights. Although we regularly evaluate acquisition opportunities and submit bids as part of our growth strategy, we do not have any current agreements, understandings or arrangements with respect to any material acquisition.   Applicable Laws and Regulations   Regulation of the Oil and Natural Gas Industry   Regulation of transportation and sale of oil. Sales of oil, condensate and natural gas liquids are not currently regulated and are made at negotiated prices. Nevertheless, Congress could reenact price controls in the future.   Our sales of oil are affected by the availability, terms and cost of transportation. The transportation of oil in common carrier pipelines is also subject to rate regulation. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (the “FERC”) regulates interstate oil pipeline transportation rates under the Interstate Commerce Act. In general, interstate oil pipeline rates must be cost-based, although settlement rates agreed to by all shippers are permitted and market-based rates may be permitted in certain circumstances. Effective January 1, 1995, the FERC implemented regulations establishing an indexing system that permits an oil pipeline, subject to limited challenges, to annually increase or decrease its transportation rates due to inflationary changes in costs using a FERC approved index, without making a cost of service filing. Every five years, the FERC reviews the appropriateness of the index in relation to industry costs. On December 16, 2010, the FERC established a new Producer Price Index for Finished Goods (the “PPI-FG”) of PPI-FG plus 2.65 percent for the five-year period beginning July 1, 2011. The basis for intrastate oil pipeline regulation, and the degree of regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate oil pipeline rates, varies from state to state. Insofar as effective interstate and intrastate rates are equally applicable to all comparable shippers, we believe that the regulation of oil transportation rates will not affect our operations in any way that is of material difference from those of our competitors.   Further, interstate and intrastate common carrier oil pipelines must provide service on a non-discriminatory basis at posted tariff rates. When oil pipelines operate at full capacity, access is governed by prorationing provisions set forth in the pipelines’ published tariffs. Accordingly, we believe that access to oil pipeline transportation services generally will be available to us to the same extent as to our competitors.   Effective November 4, 2009, pursuant to the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) issued a rule prohibiting market manipulation in the petroleum industry. The FTC rule prohibits any person, directly or indirectly, in connection with the purchase or sale of oil, gasoline or petroleum distillates at wholesale from knowingly engaging in any act, practice or course of business, including the making of any untrue statement of material fact, that operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon any person, or intentionally failing to state a material fact that under the circumstances renders a statement made by such person misleading, provided that such omission distorts or is likely to distort market conditions for any such product. A violation of this rule may result in civil penalties of up to $1 million per day per violation, in addition to any applicable penalty under the Federal Trade Commission Act.   Regulation of transportation and sale of natural gas. Historically, the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce have been regulated pursuant to the Natural Gas Act of 1938 (the “Natural Gas Act”), the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (the “Natural Gas Policy Act”) and regulations issued under those acts by the FERC. In the past, the federal government has regulated the prices at which natural gas could be sold. While sales by producers of natural gas can currently be made at uncontrolled market prices, Congress could reenact price controls in the future, and market participants are prohibited from engaging in market manipulation. Deregulation of wellhead natural gas sales began with the enactment of the Natural Gas Policy Act. In 1989, Congress   10             enacted the Natural Gas Wellhead Decontrol Act which removed all Natural Gas Act and Natural Gas Policy Act price and non-price controls affecting wellhead sales of natural gas effective January 1, 1993.   The FERC regulates interstate natural gas transportation rates and service conditions, which affects the marketing of natural gas that we produce, as well as the revenues we receive for sales of our natural gas. Since 1985, the FERC has endeavored to make natural gas transportation more accessible to natural gas buyers and sellers on an open and non-discriminatory basis. The FERC has stated that open access policies are necessary to improve the competitive structure of the interstate natural gas pipeline industry and to create a regulatory framework that will put natural gas sellers into more direct contractual relations with natural gas buyers by, among other things, unbundling the sale of natural gas from the sale of transportation and storage services. Beginning in 1992, the FERC issued Order No. 636 and a series of related orders to implement its open access policies. As a result of the Order No. 636 program, the marketing and pricing of natural gas have been significantly altered. The interstate pipelines’ traditional role as wholesalers of natural gas has been eliminated and replaced by a structure under which pipelines provide transportation and storage service on an open access basis to others who buy and sell natural gas. Although these orders do not directly regulate natural gas producers, they are intended to foster increased competition within all phases of the natural gas industry.   In 2000, the FERC issued Order No. 637 and subsequent orders, which imposed a number of additional reforms designed to enhance competition in natural gas markets. Among other things, Order No. 637 effected changes in FERC regulations relating to scheduling procedures, capacity segmentation, penalties, rights of first refusal and information reporting.   In August 2005, Congress enacted the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (the “EPAct 2005”). Among other matters, EPAct 2005 amends the Natural Gas Act to make it unlawful for “any entity,” including otherwise non-jurisdictional producers such as us, to use any deceptive or manipulative device or contrivance in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas or the purchase or sale of transportation services subject to regulation by the FERC, in contravention of rules prescribed by the FERC. The FERC’s rules implementing this provision make it unlawful, in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC, or the purchase or sale of transportation services subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC, for any entity, directly or indirectly, to use or employ any device, scheme or artifice to defraud; to make any untrue statement of material fact or omit to make any such statement necessary to make the statements made not misleading; or to engage in any act or practice that operates as a fraud or deceit upon any person. EPAct 2005 also gives the FERC authority to impose civil penalties for violations of the Natural Gas Act or Natural Gas Policy Act up to $1 million per day per violation. The new anti-manipulation rule does not apply to activities that relate only to intrastate or other non-jurisdictional sales, gathering or production, but does apply to activities of otherwise non-jurisdictional entities to the extent the activities are conducted “in connection with” natural gas sales, purchases or transportation subject to FERC jurisdiction, which now includes the annual reporting requirements under Order No. 704, described below. EPAct 2005 therefore reflects a significant expansion of the FERC’s enforcement authority. We do not anticipate we will be affected any differently than other producers of natural gas.    In December 2007, the FERC issued a rule (“Order No. 704”), as clarified in orders on rehearing, requiring that any market participant, including a producer such as us, that engages in wholesale sales or purchases of natural gas that equal or exceed 2.2 million MMBtus during a calendar year to annually report, starting May 1, 2009, such sales and purchases to the FERC. These rules are intended to increase the transparency of the wholesale natural gas markets and to assist the FERC in monitoring such markets and in detecting market manipulation. We do not anticipate that we will be affected by these rules any differently than other producers of natural gas.   We cannot accurately predict whether the FERC’s actions will achieve the goal of increasing competition in markets in which our natural gas is sold. Additional proposals and proceedings that might affect the natural gas industry are pending before the FERC and the courts. The natural gas industry historically has been very heavily regulated. Therefore, we cannot provide any assurance that the less stringent regulatory approach recently established by the FERC will continue. However, we do not believe that any action taken will affect us in a way that materially differs from the way it affects other natural gas producers.   Gathering service, which occurs upstream of jurisdictional transmission services, is regulated by the states onshore and in state waters. Although its policy is still in flux, the FERC has reclassified certain jurisdictional transmission facilities as non-jurisdictional gathering facilities, which has the tendency to increase our costs of getting natural gas to point of sale locations.    11             Intrastate natural gas transportation is also subject to regulation by state regulatory agencies. The basis for intrastate regulation of natural gas transportation and the degree of regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate natural gas pipeline rates and services varies from state to state. During the 2007 legislative session, the Texas State Legislature passed H.B. 3273 (the “Competition Bill”) and H.B. 1920 (the “LUG Bill”). The Competition Bill gives the Railroad Commission of Texas the ability to use either a cost-of-service method or a market-based method for setting rates for natural gas gathering and intrastate transportation pipelines in formal rate proceedings. It also gives the Railroad Commission specific authority to enforce its statutory duty to prevent discrimination in natural gas gathering and transportation, to enforce the requirement that parties participate in an informal complaint process and to punish purchasers, transporters, and gatherers for taking discriminatory actions against shippers and sellers. The Competition Bill also provides producers with the unilateral option to determine whether or not confidentiality provisions are included in a contract to which a producer is a party for the sale, transportation or gathering of natural gas. The LUG Bill modifies the informal complaint process at the Railroad Commission with procedures unique to lost and unaccounted for natural gas issues. It extends the types of information that can be requested, provides producers with an annual audit right, and provides the Railroad Commission with the authority to make determinations and issue orders in specific situations. Both the Competition Bill and the LUG Bill became effective September 1, 2007, and the Railroad Commission rules implementing the Railroad Commission’s authority pursuant to the bills became effective on April 28, 2008.   Insofar as such regulation within a particular state will generally affect all intrastate natural gas shippers within the state on a comparable basis, we believe that the regulation of similarly situated intrastate natural gas transportation in any states in which we operate and ship natural gas on an intrastate basis will not affect our operations in any way that is of material difference from those of our competitors. Like the regulation of interstate transportation rates, the regulation of intrastate transportation rates affects the marketing of natural gas that we produce, as well as the revenues we receive for sales of our natural gas.   Regulation of production. The production of oil and natural gas is subject to regulation under a wide range of local, state and federal statutes, rules, orders and regulations. Federal, state and local statutes and regulations require permits for drilling operations, drilling bonds and reports concerning operations. All of the states in which we own and operate properties have regulations governing conservation matters, including provisions for the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas properties, the establishment of maximum allowable rates of production from oil and natural gas wells, the regulation of well spacing, and the plugging and abandonment of wells. The effect of these regulations is to limit the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce from our wells and to limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill, although we can apply for exceptions to such regulations or to have reductions in well spacing. Moreover, each state generally imposes a production or severance tax with respect to the production and sale of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids within its jurisdiction. The failure to comply with these rules and regulations can result in substantial penalties. Our competitors in the oil and natural gas industry are subject to the same regulatory requirements and restrictions that affect our operations.   Environmental, Health and Safety Matters   General. Our operations are subject to stringent and complex federal, state and local laws and regulations governing environmental protection as well as the discharge of materials into the environment. These laws and regulations may, among other things:   · require the acquisition of various permits before drilling commences;   · restrict the types, quantities and concentration of various substances that can be released into the environment in connection with oil and natural gas drilling and production and saltwater disposal activities;   · limit or prohibit drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands and other protected areas; and   · require remedial measures to mitigate pollution from former and ongoing operations, such as requirements to close pits and plug abandoned wells.   These laws, rules and regulations may also restrict the rate of oil and natural gas production below the rate that would otherwise be possible. The regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases the cost of doing business in the industry and consequently affects profitability. Additionally, environmental laws and regulations are revised frequently, and any changes that result   12             in more stringent and costly waste handling, disposal and cleanup requirements for the oil and natural gas industry could have a significant impact on our operating costs.   The following is a summary of some of the existing laws, rules and regulations to which our business is subject.   Waste handling. The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (the “RCRA”) and comparable state statutes, regulate the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal and cleanup of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. Pursuant to regulatory guidance issued by the federal Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”), the individual states administer some or all of the provisions of RCRA, sometimes in conjunction with their own, more stringent requirements. Drilling fluids, produced waters, and most of the other wastes associated with the exploration, development, and production of oil or natural gas are currently regulated under RCRA’s non-hazardous waste provisions. However, it is possible that certain oil and natural gas exploration and production wastes now classified as non-hazardous could be classified as hazardous wastes in the future. Any such change could result in an increase in our costs to manage and dispose of wastes, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.   Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (the “CERCLA”), also known as the Superfund law, imposes joint and several liability, without regard to fault or legality of conduct, on classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. These persons include the owner or operator of the site where the release occurred, and anyone who disposed or arranged for the disposal of a hazardous substance released at the site. Under CERCLA, such persons may be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies. In addition, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third-parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment.   We currently own, lease, or operate numerous properties that have been used for oil and natural gas exploration and production for many years. Although we believe that we have utilized operating and waste disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time, hazardous substances, wastes or hydrocarbons may have been released on or under the properties owned or leased by us, or on or under other locations, including off-site locations, where such substances have been taken for disposal. In addition, some of our properties have been operated by third parties or by previous owners or operators whose treatment and disposal of hazardous substances, wastes or hydrocarbons was not under our control. These properties and the substances disposed or released on them may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws. Under such laws, we could be required to remove previously disposed substances and wastes, remediate contaminated property, or perform remedial operations to prevent future contamination.   Water discharges. The federal Water Pollution Control Act (the “Clean Water Act”) and analogous state laws, impose restrictions and strict controls with respect to the discharge of pollutants, including spills and leaks of oil and other substances, into waters of the United States. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA or an analogous state agency. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws and regulations.   Air emissions. The federal Clean Air Act (“CAA”), and comparable state laws, regulate emissions of various air pollutants through air emissions permitting programs and the imposition of other requirements. In addition, the EPA has developed, and continues to develop, stringent regulations governing emissions of toxic air pollutants at specified sources. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance with air permits or other requirements of the CAA and associated state laws and regulations.   For example, in August 2012, the EPA adopted new rules that make all oil and gas operations (production, processing, transmission, storage and distribution) subject to regulation under the New Source Performance Standards (“NSPS”) and National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (“NESHAPS”) programs. These new EPA rules also impose NSPS standards for completions of hydraulically fractured gas wells. These standards include requirements for operators to use the reduced emission completion (“REC”) techniques developed in EPA’s Natural Gas STAR program along with pit flaring of gas not sent to the gathering line. The standards are applicable to newly drilled and fractured wells as well as existing wells that are refractured. The requirement   13             for flaring of gas not sent to a gathering line became effective on October 15, 2012, and all operators are required to use REC techniques beginning January 1, 2015. Further, the new NESHAPS regulations impose maximum achievable control technology (“MACT”) standards for those glycol dehydrators and storage vessels at major sources of hazardous air pollutants not currently subject to MACT standards. We are currently evaluating the effect these rules could have on our business.   Climate change.  In December 2009, the EPA determined that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other “greenhouse gases”, or GHGs, present an endangerment to public health and the environment because emissions of such gases are, according to the EPA, contributing to warming of the earth’s atmosphere and other climatic changes. Based on these findings, the EPA has begun adopting and implementing regulations to restrict emissions of GHGs under existing provisions of the CAA. The EPA recently adopted two sets of rules regulating GHG emissions under the CAA, one of which requires a reduction in emissions of GHGs from motor vehicles and the other of which regulates emissions of GHGs from certain large stationary sources, effective January 2, 2011. The EPA’s rules relating to emissions of GHGs are currently subject to a number of legal challenges, but the federal courts have thus far declined to issue any injunctions to prevent EPA from implementing, or requiring state environmental agencies to implement, the rules. In 2011, the EPA adopted rules requiring the reporting of GHG emissions from specified large GHG emission sources in the United States, including certain onshore oil and natural gas facilities, on an annual basis beginning in 2012 for emissions occurring in 2011. We fulfilled our 2011 emissions reporting in 2012 as required by EPA’s rules.   In addition, Congress has from time to time considered adopting legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs and almost one-half of the states have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of GHGs gases primarily through the planned development of GHG emission inventories and/or regional GHG cap and trade programs. Most of these cap and trade programs work by requiring major sources of emissions, such as electric power plants, or major producers of fuels, such as refineries and natural gas processing plants, to acquire and surrender emission allowances. The number of allowances available for purchase is reduced each year in an effort to achieve the overall GHG emission reduction goal.   The adoption of legislation or regulatory programs to reduce emissions of GHGs could require us to incur increased operating costs, such as costs to purchase and operate emissions control systems, to acquire emissions allowances, or to comply with new regulatory or reporting requirements. Any such legislation or regulatory programs could also increase the cost of consuming, and thereby reduce demand for, the oil and natural gas we produce. Consequently, legislation and regulatory programs to reduce emissions of GHGs could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Finally, it should be noted that some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of GHGs in the earth’s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, and floods and other climatic events. If any such effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.   Hydraulic fracturing. Hydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of natural gas and/or oil from dense subsurface rock formations. The hydraulic fracturing process involves the injection of water, sand, and chemicals under pressure into the formation to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. We commonly use hydraulic fracturing as part of our operations. Hydraulic fracturing typically is regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions, but the EPA has asserted federal regulatory authority pursuant to the Safe Drinking Water Act over certain hydraulic fracturing activities involving the use of diesel. In addition, legislation has been introduced before Congress to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing under the Safe Drinking Water Act and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process. At the state level, several states have adopted or are considering legal requirements that could impose more stringent permitting, disclosure, and well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities. For example, Texas adopted rules requiring public disclosure of non-confidential information regarding fluids used in hydraulic fracturing activities that became effective on February 1, 2012, and New Mexico adopted similar rules that became effective on February 15, 2012. We believe that we follow applicable standard industry practices and legal requirements for groundwater protection in our hydraulic fracturing activities. Nonetheless, if new or more stringent federal, state, or local legal restrictions relating to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted in areas where we operate, we could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such requirements, experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development, or production activities, and perhaps even be precluded from drilling wells.     14             In addition, certain governmental reviews are either underway or being proposed that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices. The White House Council on Environmental Quality is coordinating an administration-wide review of hydraulic fracturing practices, and the EPA is performing a study of the potential environmental effects of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water and groundwater resources. The EPA’s study includes 18 separate research projects addressing topics such as water acquisition, chemical mixing, well injection, flowback and produced water, and wastewater treatment and waste disposal. The EPA has indicated that it expects to issue its study report in late 2014. Moreover, the EPA is developing effluent limitations for the treatment and discharge of wastewater resulting from hydraulic fracturing activities and plans to propose these standards by 2014. Other governmental agencies, including the United States Department of Energy and the United States Department of the Interior, are evaluating various other aspects of hydraulic fracturing. These ongoing or proposed studies, depending on their degree of pursuit and any meaningful results obtained, could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing under the federal Safe Drinking Water Act or other regulatory mechanisms.   To our knowledge, there have been no citations, suits, or contamination of potable drinking water arising from our fracturing operations. We do not have insurance policies in effect that are intended to provide coverage for losses solely related to hydraulic fracturing operations; however, we believe our general liability and excess liability insurance policies may cover third-party claims related to hydraulic fracturing operations and associated legal expenses in accordance with, and subject to, the terms of such policies. If new laws or regulations significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing activities or impose burdens on new permitting or operating requirements, our ability to utilize hydraulic fracturing may be curtailed and this may in turn reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we are ultimately able to produce from our reserves.    Endangered species. The federal Endangered Species Act and analogous state laws regulate activities that could have an adverse effect on threatened or endangered species. Some of our drilling operations are conducted in areas where protected species are known to exist. In these areas, we may be obligated to develop and implement plans to avoid potential adverse impacts to protected species, and we may be prohibited from conducting drilling operations in certain locations or during certain seasons, such as breeding and nesting seasons, when our operations could have an adverse effect on the species. It is also possible that a federal or state agency could order a complete halt to drilling activities in certain locations if it is determined that such activities may have a serious adverse effect on a protected species. The presence of a protected species in areas where we perform drilling activities could impair our ability to timely complete drilling and developmental operations and could adversely affect our future production from those areas.   National Environmental Policy Act. Oil and natural gas exploration and production activities on federal lands are subject to the National Environmental Policy Act (the “NEPA”). NEPA requires federal agencies, including the Department of Interior, to evaluate major agency actions having the potential to significantly impact the environment. In the course of such evaluations, an agency will prepare an environmental assessment that assesses the potential direct, indirect and cumulative impacts of a proposed project and, if necessary, will prepare a more detailed environmental impact statement that may be made available for public review and comment. All of our current exploration and production activities, as well as proposed exploration and development plans, on federal lands require governmental permits that are subject to the requirements of NEPA. This process has the potential to delay or even halt development of some of our oil and natural gas projects.   OSHA and other laws and regulation. We are subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”), and comparable state statutes. The OSHA hazard communication standard, the EPA community right-to-know regulations under the Title III of CERCLA and similar state statutes require that we organize and/or disclose information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations. Also, pursuant to OSHA, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration has established a variety of standards relating to workplace exposure to hazardous substances and employee health and safety. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with the applicable requirements of OSHA and comparable laws.   We believe that we are in substantial compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations applicable to our current operations and that our continued compliance with existing requirements will not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. For instance, we did not incur any material capital expenditures for remediation or pollution control activities during 2012. Additionally, as of the date of this report, we are not aware of any environmental issues or claims that will require material capital expenditures during 2012. However, we cannot assure you that the passage or application of more stringent laws or regulations in the future will not have a negative impact on our financial position or results of operation.   15             Our Employees   Our corporate headquarters are located at One Concho Center, 600 West Illinois Avenue Midland, Texas 79701. We also maintain various field offices in Texas and New Mexico. At December 31, 2012, we had 745 employees, 290 of whom were employed in field operations. Our future success will depend partially on our ability to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel. We are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements and have not experienced any strikes or work stoppages. We consider our relations with our employees to be good. We also utilize the services of independent contractors to perform various field and other services.   Available Information   We file or furnish annual, quarterly and current reports, proxy statements and other documents with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) under the Exchange Act. The public may read and copy any materials that we file or furnish with the SEC at the SEC's Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549. The public may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. Also, the SEC maintains a website that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers, including us, that file or furnish electronically with the SEC. The public can obtain any documents that we file with the SEC at www.sec.gov.    We also make available free of charge through our website, www.concho.com, our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and, if applicable, amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the SEC.  16             Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Reconciliations   PV-10   PV-10 is derived from the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, which is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. PV-10 is a computation of the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows on a pre-tax basis. PV-10 is equal to the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows at the applicable date, before deducting future income taxes, discounted at 10 percent. We believe that the presentation of PV-10 is relevant and useful to investors because it presents the discounted future net cash flows attributable to our estimated proved reserves prior to taking into account future corporate income taxes, and it is a useful measure for evaluating the relative monetary significance of our oil and natural gas assets. Further, investors may utilize the measure as a basis for comparison of the relative size and value of our reserves to other companies. We use this measure when assessing the potential return on investment related to our oil and natural gas assets. PV-10, however, is not a substitute for the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows. Our PV-10 measure and the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows do not purport to present the fair value of our oil and natural gas reserves.   The following table provides a reconciliation of PV-10 to the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows at December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010:                                                                    December 31,     (in millions)       2012            2011            2010                                                                                                                                                PV-10 .................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................        $    8,327.0        $    8,399.8        $    6,061.2      Present value of future income taxes discounted at 10% .......................................................................................................................................................

EBITDAX is not a measure of net income or cash flow as determined by GAAP.   Our EBITDAX measure provides additional information which may be used to better understand our operations, and it is also a material component of one of the financial covenants under our credit facility. EBITDAX is one of several metrics that we use as a supplemental financial measurement in the evaluation of our business and should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income, as an indicator of our operating performance. Certain items excluded from EBITDAX are significant components in understanding and assessing a company’s financial performance, such as a company’s cost of capital and tax structure, as well as the historic cost of depreciable and depletable assets. EBITDAX, as used by us, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. We believe that EBITDAX is a widely followed measure of operating performance and is one of many metrics used by our management team and by other users of our consolidated financial statements, including by lenders pursuant to a covenant in our credit facility. For example, EBITDAX can be used to assess our operating performance and return on capital in comparison to other independent exploration and production companies without regard to financial or capital structure, and to assess the financial performance of our assets and our company without regard to capital structure or historical cost basis. Further, under our credit facility, an event of default could arise if we were not able to satisfy and remain in compliance with specified financial ratios, including the maintenance of a quarterly ratio of total debt to consolidated last twelve months EBITDAX of no greater than 4.0 to 1.0. Non-compliance with this ratio could trigger an event of default under our credit facility, which then could trigger an event of default under our indentures.

Risk Factors   You should consider carefully the following risk factors together with all of the other information included in this report and other reports filed with the SEC, before investing in our shares. If any of the following risks were actually to occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In that case, the trading price of our shares could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment.   Risks Related to Our Business   Oil, natural gas and NGL prices are volatile. A decline in oil, natural gas and NGL prices could adversely affect our financial position, financial results, cash flow, access to capital and ability to grow.   Our future financial condition, revenues, results of operations, rate of growth and the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties depend primarily upon the prices we receive for our oil and natural gas production and the prices prevailing from time to time for oil and natural gas. Oil, natural gas, and NGL prices historically have been volatile, and are likely to continue to be volatile in the future, especially given current geopolitical conditions. This price volatility also affects the amount of cash flow we have available for capital expenditures and our ability to borrow money or raise additional capital. The prices for oil, natural gas and NGLs are subject to a variety of factors beyond our control, including:   · the level of consumer demand for oil, natural gas and NGLs;   · the domestic and foreign supply of oil, natural gas, and NGLs;   · inventory levels of Cushing, Oklahoma, the benchmark for WTI oil prices;   · liquefied natural gas deliveries to and from the United States;   · commodity processing, gathering and transportation availability and the availability of refining capacity;   · the price and level of imports of foreign oil and natural gas;   · the ability of the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other exporting nations to agree to and maintain oil price and production controls;   · domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes;   · the price and availability of alternative fuel sources;   · weather conditions;   · political conditions or hostilities in oil and natural gas producing regions, including the Middle East, Africa and South America;   · technological advances affecting energy consumption;    · effect of energy conservation efforts;   · variations between product prices at sales points and applicable index prices; and   · worldwide economic conditions.    19               Furthermore, oil and natural gas prices continued to be volatile in 2012. For example, the NYMEX oil prices in 2012 ranged from a high of $109.77 to a low of $77.69 per Bbl and the NYMEX natural gas prices in 2012 ranged from a high of $3.90 to a low of $1.91 per MMBtu. Further, the NYMEX oil prices and NYMEX natural gas prices reached lows of $91.82 per Bbl and $3.11 per MMBtu, respectively, during the period from January 1, 2013 to February 20, 2013.   Declines in oil, natural gas and NGL prices would not only reduce our revenue, but could also reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce economically. This in turn would lower the amount of oil and natural gas reserves we could recognize and, as a result, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. If the oil and natural gas industry experiences significant price declines, we may, among other things, be unable to maintain or increase our borrowing capacity, repay current or future indebtedness or obtain additional capital on attractive terms, all of which can adversely affect the value of our securities.   Drilling for and producing oil and natural gas are high-risk activities with many uncertainties that could cause our expenses to increase or our cash flows and production volumes to decrease.   Our future financial condition and results of operations will depend on the success of our exploration and production activities. Our oil and natural gas exploration and production activities are subject to numerous risks, including the risk that drilling will not result in commercially viable oil or natural gas production. Our decisions to purchase, explore, develop or otherwise exploit prospects or properties will depend in part on the evaluation of data obtained through geophysical and geological analyses, production data and engineering studies, the results of which are often inconclusive or subject to varying interpretations. Our cost of drilling, completing, equipping and operating wells is often uncertain before drilling commences. Overruns in budgeted expenditures are common risks that can make a particular project uneconomical or less economical than forecasted. Further, many factors may curtail, delay or cancel drilling, including the following:   · delays imposed by or resulting from compliance with regulatory and contractual requirements;   · pressure or irregularities in geological formations;   · shortages of or delays in obtaining equipment and qualified personnel;   · equipment failures or accidents;   · adverse weather conditions;   · reductions in oil, natural gas and NGL prices;   · surface access restrictions;   · loss of title or other title related issues;   · oil, natural gas liquids or natural gas gathering, transportation and processing availability restrictions or limitations; and   · limitations in the market for oil, natural gas and NGLs.   Federal and state legislation and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays. Hydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons from tight formations. We routinely utilize hydraulic fracturing techniques in many of our drilling and completion programs. The process involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into the formation to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. The process is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions. However, the EPA recently asserted federal regulatory authority over hydraulic fracturing involving diesel additives under the Safe Drinking Water Act’s Underground Injection Control Program. While the EPA has yet to take any action to enforce or implement this newly asserted regulatory authority, industry groups have filed suit challenging the EPA’s recent decision. At the same time, the White House Council on Environmental Quality is coordinating an administration-wide review of hydraulic-fracturing practices, and the EPA is performing a study of the potential environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing   20             activities on drinking water and groundwater resources. The EPA’s study includes 18 separate research projects addressing topics such as water acquisition, chemical mixing, well injection, flowback and produced water, and wastewater treatment and waste disposal. The EPA has indicated that it expects to issue its study report in late 2014. In addition, the United States Department of Energy is conducting an investigation into practices the agency could recommend to better protect the environment from drilling using hydraulic-fracturing completion methods. Additionally, certain members of the Congress have called upon the United States Government Accountability Office to investigate how hydraulic fracturing might adversely affect water resources, the SEC to investigate the natural gas industry and any possible misleading of investors or the public regarding the economic feasibility of pursuing natural gas deposits in shales by means of hydraulic fracturing, and the United States Energy Information Administration to provide a better understanding of that agency’s estimates regarding natural gas reserves, including reserves from shale formations, as well as uncertainties associated with those estimates. Legislation also has been introduced before Congress to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process. These ongoing or proposed studies, depending on their degree of pursuit and any meaningful results obtained, could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing under the Safe Drinking Water Act or other regulatory mechanism. In addition, some states have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, regulations that could impose more stringent permitting, disclosure and well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations. For example, Colorado, Pennsylvania, and Wyoming have each adopted a variety of well construction, set back, and disclosure regulations limiting how fracturing can be performed and requiring various degrees of chemical disclosure. In addition, Texas adopted rules requiring public disclosure of non-confidential information regarding fluids used in hydraulic fracturing activities that became effective on February 1, 2012, and New Mexico adopted similar rules that became effective on February 15, 2012. In addition to state laws, local land use restrictions, such as city ordinances, may restrict or prohibit the performance of drilling in general and/or hydraulic fracturing in particular. In the event state, local, or municipal legal restrictions are adopted in areas where we are currently conducting, or in the future plan to conduct operations, we may incur additional costs to comply with such requirements that may be significant in nature, experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development, or production activities, and perhaps even be precluded from the drilling of wells. Further, in August 2012, the EPA adopted new rules that make all oil and natural gas operations (production, processing, transmission, storage and distribution) subject to regulation under the NSPS and NESHAPS programs. These new EPA rules also impose NSPS standards for completions of hydraulically fractured natural gas wells. These standards include requirements for operators to use the REC techniques developed in the EPA’s Natural Gas STAR program along with pit flaring of natural gas not sent to the gathering line. The standards are applicable to newly drilled and fractured wells as well as existing wells that are refractured. The requirement for flaring of gas not sent to a gathering line became effective on October 15, 2012, and all operators are required to use REC techniques beginning January 1, 2015. Further, the new NESHAPS regulations impose MACT standards for those glycol dehydrators and storage vessels at major sources of hazardous air pollutants not currently subject to MACT standards. We are currently evaluating the effect these rules could have on our business. If new laws or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing are adopted, such laws could make it more difficult or costly for us to perform fracturing to stimulate production from tight formations. In addition, if hydraulic fracturing becomes regulated at the federal level as a result of federal legislation or regulatory initiatives by the EPA, our fracturing activities could become subject to additional permitting requirements, and also result in permitting delays and potential cost increases. Restrictions on hydraulic fracturing could also reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we are ultimately able to produce from our reserves.   Our operations are substantially dependent on the availability of water. Restrictions on our ability to obtain water may have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Water is an essential component of both the drilling and hydraulic fracturing processes. Historically, we have been able to purchase water from local land owners and other sources for use in our operations. During 2012, West Texas and Southeast New Mexico experienced the lowest inflows of water in recent history. As a result of this severe drought, some local water districts may begin restricting the use of water subject to their jurisdiction for drilling and hydraulic fracturing in order to protect the local water supply. If we are unable to obtain water to use in our operations from local sources, we may be unable to economically produce oil and natural gas, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.    21             Estimates of proved reserves and future net cash flows are not precise. The actual quantities of our proved reserves and our future net cash flows may prove to be lower than estimated.   Numerous uncertainties exist in estimating quantities of proved reserves and future net cash flows therefrom. Our estimates of proved reserves and related future net cash flows are based on various assumptions, which may ultimately prove to be inaccurate.   Petroleum engineering is a subjective process of estimating accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner. Estimates of economically recoverable oil and natural gas reserves and of future net cash flows depend upon a number of variable factors and assumptions, including the following:   · historical production from the area compared with production from other producing areas;   · the assumed effects of regulations by governmental agencies;   · the quality, quantity and interpretation of available relevant data;   · assumptions concerning future commodity prices; and   · assumptions concerning future operating costs; severance, ad valorem and excise taxes; development costs; and workover and remedial costs.   Because all reserve estimates are to some degree subjective, each of the following items, or other items not identified below, may differ materially from those assumed in estimating reserves:   · the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered;   · the production and operating costs incurred;   · the amount and timing of future development expenditures; and   · future commodity prices.   Furthermore, different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserves and cash flows based on the same data. Our actual production, revenues and expenditures with respect to reserves will likely be different from estimates and the differences may be material.   Our business requires substantial capital expenditures. We may be unable to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms or at all, which could lead to a decline in our oil and natural gas reserves.   The oil and natural gas industry is capital intensive. We make and expect to continue to make substantial capital expenditures for the acquisition, exploration and development of oil and natural gas reserves. At December 31, 2012, total debt outstanding under our credit facility was $304.0 million (and total debt at December 31, 2012 was $3.1 billion), and approximately $2.2 billion was available to be borrowed under our credit facility. Expenditures for acquisition, exploration and development of oil and natural gas properties are the primary use of our capital resources. We incurred approximately $2.8 billion in acquisition, exploration and development activities (excluding asset retirement obligations) during the year ended December 31, 2012 ($1.3 billion of which was related to acquisitions). Under our 2013 capital budget, we currently intend to invest approximately $1.6 billion for exploration and development activities and customary acquisition of leasehold acreage.   We intend to finance our future capital expenditures, other than significant acquisitions, primarily through cash flow from operations and, if needed, through borrowings under our credit facility; however, our financing needs may require us to alter or increase our capitalization substantially through the issuance of debt or equity securities. The issuance of additional equity securities could have a dilutive effect on the value of our common stock. Additional borrowings under our credit facility or the issuance of additional debt securities will require that a greater portion of our cash flow from operations be used for the payment of interest and principal on our debt, thereby reducing our ability to use cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures and acquisitions. In addition, our credit facility imposes certain limitations on our ability to incur additional indebtedness other than indebtedness under our credit facility. If we desire to issue additional debt securities other than as expressly permitted under our credit facility, we will be required to seek the consent of the lenders in accordance with the requirements of the credit facility, which consent may be withheld by the lenders at their discretion. If we incur certain additional indebtedness, our borrowing base under our credit facility may be   22             reduced. Additional financing also may not be available on acceptable terms or at all. In the event additional capital resources are unavailable, we may curtail drilling, development and other activities or be forced to sell some of our assets on an untimely or unfavorable basis.   Our cash flow from operations and access to capital are subject to a number of variables, including:   · our proved reserves;   · the level of oil and natural gas we are able to produce from existing wells;   · the prices at which our commodities are sold;    · global credit and securities markets;    · the ability and willingness of lenders and investors to provide capital and the cost of the capital; and   · our ability to acquire, locate and produce new reserves.   If our revenues or the borrowing base under our credit facility decrease as a result of lower commodity prices, operating difficulties, declines in reserves, lending requirements or regulations, or for any other reason, we may have limited ability to obtain the capital necessary to sustain our operations at current levels. As a result, we may require additional capital to fund our operations, and we may not be able to obtain debt or equity financing to satisfy our capital requirements. If cash generated from operations or borrowings available under our credit facility is not sufficient to meet our capital requirements, the failure to obtain additional financing could result in a curtailment of our operations relating to the development of our prospects, which in turn could lead to a decline in our oil and natural gas reserves, and could adversely affect our production, revenues and results of operations.   We have substantial indebtedness and may incur substantially more debt. Higher levels of indebtedness make us more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments in our business.    We had approximately $3.1 billion of outstanding debt at December 31, 2012. At December 31, 2012, the borrowing base under our credit facility was $3.0  billion and commitments from our bank group totaled $2.5 billion, of which approximately $2.2 billion was available to be borrowed.   As a result of our indebtedness, we will need to use a portion of our cash flow to pay interest, which will reduce the amount we will have available to fund our operations and other business activities and could limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the industry in which we operate. Our indebtedness under our credit facility is at a variable interest rate, and so a rise in interest rates will generate greater interest expense to the extent we do not have applicable interest rate fluctuation hedges. The amount of our debt may also cause us to be more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments in our business.    We may incur substantially more debt in the future. The indentures governing our senior notes contain restrictions on our incurrence of additional indebtedness. These restrictions, however, are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions, and under certain circumstances, we could incur substantial additional indebtedness in compliance with these restrictions. Moreover, these restrictions do not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness under the indentures.    Our ability to meet our debt obligations and other expenses will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic, regulatory and other factors, many of which we are unable to control. If our cash flow is not sufficient to service our debt, we may be required to refinance debt, sell assets or sell additional equity on terms that we may not find attractive if it may be done at all. Further, our failure to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants relating to our indebtedness could result in a default under that indebtedness, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.   Our lenders can limit our borrowing capabilities, which may materially impact our operations.   At December 31, 2012, we had approximately $304.0 million of outstanding debt under our credit facility, and our borrowing base was $3.0 billion and commitments from our bank group totaled $2.5 billion. The borrowing base under our credit facility is semi-annually redetermined based upon a number of factors, including commodity prices and reserve levels. In addition, between redeterminations we and, if requested by 66 2/3 percent of our lenders, our lenders, may each request one special redetermination.   23             Upon a redetermination, our borrowing base could be substantially reduced, and in the event the amount outstanding under our credit facility at any time exceeds the borrowing base at such time, we may be required to repay a portion of our outstanding borrowings. If we incur certain additional indebtedness, our borrowing base under our credit facility may be reduced. We expect to utilize cash flow from operations, bank borrowings, debt and equity financings and asset sales to fund our acquisition, exploration and development activities. A reduction in our borrowing base could limit our activities. In addition, we may significantly alter our capitalization in order to make future acquisitions or develop our properties. These changes in capitalization may significantly increase our level of debt. If we incur additional debt for these or other purposes, the related risks that we now face could intensify. A higher level of debt also increases the risk that we may default on our debt obligations. Our ability to meet our debt obligations and to reduce our level of debt depends on our future performance which is affected by general economic conditions and financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.    Our operations expose us to significant costs and liabilities with respect to environmental and operational safety matters.   We may incur significant delays, costs and liabilities as a result of environmental, health and safety requirements applicable to our oil and natural gas exploration, development and production, and related saltwater disposal activities. These delays, costs and liabilities could arise under a wide range of federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment, health and safety, including regulations and enforcement policies that have tended to become increasingly strict over time. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, imposition of cleanup and site restoration costs and liens, and, in some instances, issuance of orders or injunctions limiting or requiring discontinuation of certain operations. In addition, claims for damages to persons or property, including natural resources, may result from the environmental, health and safety impacts of our operations.   Strict as well as joint and several liability for a variety of environmental costs may be imposed under certain environmental laws, which could cause us to become liable for the conduct of others or for consequences of our own actions that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time those actions were taken. New laws, regulations or enforcement policies could be more stringent and impose unforeseen liabilities or significantly increase compliance costs. If we were not able to recover the resulting costs through insurance or increased revenues, our production, revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected.   Our producing properties are concentrated in the Permian Basin of Southeast New Mexico and West Texas, making us vulnerable to risks associated with operating in one major geographic area. In addition, we have a large amount of proved reserves attributable to a small number of producing horizons within this area.   Our producing properties are geographically concentrated in the Permian Basin of Southeast New Mexico and West Texas. At December 31, 2012, substantially all of our total estimated proved reserves were attributable to properties located in this area. As a result of this concentration, we may be disproportionately exposed to the impact of regional supply and demand factors, delays or interruptions of production from wells in this area caused by governmental regulation, processing or transportation capacity constraints, market limitations, water shortages or other drought related conditions or interruption of the processing or transportation of oil, natural gas or natural gas liquids.    In addition to the geographic concentration of our producing properties described above, at December 31, 2012, approximately (i) 40.6 percent of our proved reserves were attributable to the Yeso formation, which includes both the Paddock and Blinebry intervals, underlying our oil and natural gas properties located in Southeast New Mexico; and (ii) 27.6 percent of our proved reserves were attributable to the Wolfberry play in West Texas. This concentration of assets within a small number of producing horizons exposes us to additional risks, such as changes in field-wide rules and regulations that could cause us to permanently or temporarily shut-in all of our wells within a field.   Future price declines could result in a reduction in the carrying value of our proved oil and natural gas properties, which could adversely affect our results of operations.   Declines in commodity prices may result in having to make substantial downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves. If this occurs, or if our estimates of production or economic factors change, accounting rules may require us to write-down, as a noncash charge to earnings, the carrying value of our proved oil and natural gas properties for impairments. We are required to perform impairment tests on proved assets whenever events or changes in circumstances warrant a review of our proved oil and natural gas properties. To the extent such tests indicate a reduction of the estimated useful life or estimated future cash flows of our oil and natural gas properties, the carrying value may not be recoverable and therefore require a write-down. We may incur impairment charges in the future, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations in the period incurred.    24             We periodically evaluate our unproved oil and natural gas properties for impairment, and could be required to recognize noncash charges to earnings of future periods.   At December 31, 2012, we carried unproved property costs of $ 1.1 billion. GAAP requires periodic evaluation of these costs on a project-by-project basis in comparison to their estimated fair value. These evaluations will be affected by the results of exploration activities, commodity price circumstances, planned future sales or expiration of all or a portion of the leases, contracts and permits appurtenant to such projects. If the quantity of potential reserves determined by such evaluations is not sufficient to fully recover the cost invested in each project, we will recognize noncash charges to earnings of future periods.   Part of our strategy involves exploratory drilling, including drilling in new or emerging plays. As a result, our drilling results in these areas are uncertain, and the value of our undeveloped acreage will decline if drilling results are unsuccessful.   The results of our exploratory drilling in new or emerging plays are more uncertain than drilling results in areas that are developed and have established production. Since new or emerging plays and new formations have limited or no production history, we are unable to use past drilling results in those areas to help predict our future drilling results. As a result, our cost of drilling, completing and operating wells in these areas may be higher than initially expected, and the value of our undeveloped acreage will decline if drilling results are unsuccessful.   Our commodity price risk management program may cause us to forego additional future profits or result in our making cash payments to our counterparties.   To reduce our exposure to changes in the prices of commodities, we have entered into and may in the future enter into additional commodity price risk management arrangements for a portion of our oil and natural gas production. The agreements that we have entered into generally have the effect of providing us with a fixed price for a portion of our expected future oil and natural gas production over a fixed period of time. Commodity price risk management arrangements expose us to the risk of financial loss and may limit our ability to benefit from increases in commodity prices in some circumstances, including the following:   · the counterparty to a commodity price risk management contract may default on its contractual obligations to us;   · there may be a change in the expected differential between the underlying price in a commodity price risk management agreement and actual prices received; or   · market prices may exceed the prices which we are contracted to receive, resulting in our need to make significant cash payments to our counterparties.   Our commodity price risk management activities could have the effect of reducing our revenues, net income and the value of our securities. At December 31, 2012, the net unrealized gain on our commodity price risk management contracts was approximately $25.1 million. An average increase in the commodity price of $10.00 per barrel of oil from the commodity price at December 31, 2012 would have resulted in a $245.9 million net unrealized loss on our commodity price risk management contracts, as reflected on our balance sheet at December 31, 2012. We may continue to incur significant unrealized gains or losses in the future from our commodity price risk management activities to the extent market prices increase or decrease and our derivatives contracts remain in place.   Our identified inventory of drilling locations and recompletion opportunities are scheduled out over several years, making them susceptible to uncertainties that could materially alter the occurrence or timing of their drilling.   We have identified and scheduled the drilling of certain of our drilling locations as an estimation of our future multi-year development activities on our existing acreage. At December 31, 2012, we had identified 12,269 gross drilling locations, with proved reserves attributable to 2,326 of such locations. These identified locations represent a significant part of our growth strategy. Our ability to drill and develop these locations depends on a number of uncertainties, including (i) our ability to timely drill wells on lands subject to complex development terms and circumstances; (ii) the availability of capital, equipment, services and personnel; (iii) seasonal conditions; (iv) regulatory and third party approvals; (v) commodity prices; and (vi) drilling and recompletion costs and results. Because of these and other potential uncertainties, we may never drill the numerous potential locations we have identified or produce oil or natural gas from these or any other potential locations. As such, our actual development activities may materially differ from those presently identified, which could adversely affect our production, revenues and results of operations.    25             Approximately 39 percent of our total estimated proved reserves at December 31, 2012 were undeveloped, and those reserves may not ultimately be developed.   At December 31, 2012, approximately 39 percent of our total estimated proved reserves were undeveloped. Recovery of undeveloped reserves requires significant capital expenditures and successful drilling. Our reserve data assumes that we can and will make these expenditures and conduct these operations successfully. These assumptions, however, may not prove correct. Our reserve report at December 31, 2012 includes estimates of total future development costs over the next five years associated with our proved undeveloped reserves of approximately $2.9 billion. If we choose not to spend the capital to develop these reserves, or if we are not otherwise able to successfully develop these reserves, we will be required to write-off these reserves. In addition, under the SEC’s reserve rules, because proved undeveloped reserves may be booked only if they relate to wells scheduled to be drilled within five years of the date of booking, we may be required to write-off any proved undeveloped reserves that are not developed within this five year timeframe. Any such write-offs of our reserves could reduce our ability to borrow money and could reduce the value of our securities.   Unless we replace our oil and natural gas reserves, our reserves and production will decline, which would adversely affect our cash flow, our ability to raise capital and the value of our securities.   Unless we conduct successful development and exploration activities or acquire properties containing proved reserves, our proved reserves will decline as those reserves are produced. Producing oil and natural gas reservoirs generally are characterized by declining production rates that vary depending upon reservoir characteristics and other factors. Our future oil and natural gas reserves and production, and therefore our cash flow and results of operations, are highly dependent on our success in efficiently developing and exploiting our current reserves and economically finding or acquiring additional recoverable reserves. The value of our securities and our ability to raise capital will be adversely impacted if we are not able to replace our reserves that are depleted by production. We may not be able to develop, exploit, find or acquire sufficient additional reserves to replace our current and future production.   The Standardized Measure and PV-10 of our estimated reserves are not accurate estimates of the current fair value of our estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves.   Standardized Measure is a reporting convention that provides a common basis for comparing oil and natural gas companies subject to the rules and regulations of the SEC. Our non-GAAP financial measure, PV-10, is a similar reporting convention that we have disclosed in this report. Both measures require the use of operating and development costs prevailing as of the date of computation. Consequently, they will not reflect the prices ordinarily received or that will be received for oil and natural gas production because of varying market conditions, nor may it reflect the actual costs that will be required to produce or develop the oil and natural gas properties. Accordingly, estimates included herein of future net cash flows may be materially different from the future net cash flows that are ultimately received. In addition, the 10 percent discount factor, which is required by the rules and regulations of the SEC to be used in calculating discounted future net cash flows for reporting purposes, may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with our company or the oil and natural gas industry in general. Therefore, Standardized Measure or PV-10 included in this report should not be construed as accurate estimates of the current fair value of our proved reserves.    If average oil prices were $10.00 per barrel lower than the average price we used, our PV-10 at December 31, 2012 would have decreased from $8.3 billion to $7.2 billion. If average natural gas prices were $1.00 per MMBtu lower than the average price we used, our PV-10 at December 31, 2012, would have decreased from $8.3 billion to $7.4 billion. Any adjustments to the estimates of proved reserves or decreases in the price of our commodities may decrease the value of our securities.    We may be unable to make attractive acquisitions or successfully integrate acquired companies or assets, and any inability to do so may disrupt our business and hinder our ability to grow.   One aspect of our business strategy calls for acquisitions of businesses or assets that complement or expand our current business. We may not be able to identify attractive acquisition opportunities. Even if we do identify attractive candidates, we may not be able to complete the acquisition of them or do so on commercially acceptable terms.   In addition, our credit facility and the indentures governing our senior notes impose certain limitations on our ability to enter into mergers or combination transactions. Our credit facility and the indentures governing our senior notes also limit our ability to incur certain indebtedness, which could indirectly limit our ability to engage in acquisitions of businesses or assets. If we desire to engage in an acquisition that is otherwise prohibited by our credit facility or the indentures governing our senior notes, we will be required to seek the consent of our lenders or the holders of the senior notes in accordance with the requirements of the credit facility or the indentures, which consent may be withheld by the lenders under our credit facility or such holders of senior notes at their sole discretion.  26               If we acquire another business or assets, we could have difficulty integrating its operations, systems, management and other personnel and technology with our own. These difficulties could disrupt our ongoing business, distract our management and employees, increase our expenses and adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, we may incur additional debt or issue additional equity to pay for any future acquisitions, subject to the limitations described above.   Our acquisitions may prove to be worth less than what we paid because of uncertainties in evaluating recoverable reserves and could expose us to potentially significant liabilities.   We obtained the majority of our current reserve base through acquisitions of producing properties and undeveloped acreage. We expect that acquisitions will continue to contribute to our future growth. In connection with these and potential future acquisitions, we are often only able to perform limited due diligence.   Successful acquisitions of oil and natural gas properties require an assessment of a number of factors, including estimates of recoverable reserves, the timing of recovering reserves, exploration potential, future commodity prices, operating costs and potential environmental, regulatory and other liabilities. Such assessments are inexact, and we cannot make these assessments with a high degree of accuracy. In connection with our assessments, we perform a review of the acquired properties. However, such a review will not reveal all existing or potential problems. In addition, our review may not permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to fully assess their deficiencies and capabilities. We do not inspect every well. Even when we inspect a well, we do not always discover structural, subsurface and environmental problems that may exist or arise.   There may be threatened, contemplated, asserted or other claims against the acquired assets related to environmental, title, regulatory, tax, contract, litigation or other matters of which we are unaware, which could materially and adversely affect our production, revenues and results of operations. We are sometimes able to obtain contractual indemnification for preclosing liabilities, including environmental liabilities, but we generally acquire interests in properties on an “as is” basis with limited remedies for breaches of representations and warranties. In addition, even when we are able to obtain such indemnification from the sellers, these indemnification obligations usually expire over time and expose us to potential unindemnified liabilities, which could materially adversely affect our production, revenues and results of operations.   Shortages of oilfield equipment, services and qualified personnel could delay our drilling program and increase the prices we pay to obtain such equipment, services and personnel.   The demand for qualified and experienced field personnel to drill wells and conduct field operations, geologists, geophysicists, engineers and other professionals in the oil and natural gas industry can fluctuate significantly, often in correlation with commodity prices, causing periodic shortages. Historically, there have been shortages of drilling and workover rigs, pipe and other oilfield equipment as demand for rigs and equipment has increased along with the number of wells being drilled. These factors also cause significant increases in costs for equipment, services and personnel. Higher commodity prices generally stimulate demand and result in increased prices for drilling and workover rigs, crews and associated supplies, equipment and services. It is beyond our control and ability to predict whether these conditions will exist in the future and, if so, what their timing and duration will be. These types of shortages or price increases could significantly decrease our profit margin, cash flow and operating results, or restrict our ability to drill the wells and conduct the operations which we currently have planned and budgeted or which we may plan in the future.   Our exploration and development drilling may not result in commercially productive reserves.   Drilling activities are subject to many risks, including the risk that commercially productive reservoirs will not be encountered. New wells that we drill may not be productive, or we may not recover all or any portion of our investment in such wells. The seismic data and other technologies we use do not allow us to know conclusively prior to drilling a well that oil or natural gas is present or may be produced economically. Drilling for oil and natural gas often involves unprofitable results, not only from dry holes but also from wells that are productive but do not produce sufficient net reserves to return a profit at then realized prices after deducting drilling, operating and other costs. The cost of drilling, completing and operating a well is often uncertain, and cost factors can adversely affect the economics of a project. Further, our drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of numerous factors, including:   · unexpected drilling conditions;   · title problems;   · pressure or lost circulation in formations;    27             · equipment failures or accidents;   · adverse weather conditions;   · compliance with environmental and other governmental or contractual requirements; and   · increases in the cost of, or shortages or delays in the availability of, electricity, water, supplies, materials, drilling or workover rigs, equipment and services.   We may incur substantial losses and be subject to substantial liability claims as a result of our oil and natural gas operations. In addition, we may not be insured for, or our insurance may be inadequate to protect us against, these risks.   We are not insured against all risks. Losses and liabilities arising from uninsured and underinsured events could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our oil and natural gas exploration and production activities, including well stimulation and completion activities such as hydraulic fracturing, are subject to all of the operating risks associated with drilling for and producing oil and natural gas, including the possibility of:   · environmental hazards, such as uncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas, brine, well fluids, toxic gas or other pollution into the environment, including groundwater contamination;   · abnormally pressured or structured formations;   · mechanical difficulties, such as stuck oilfield drilling and service tools and casing collapse;   · fires, explosions and ruptures of pipelines;   · personal injuries and death; and   · natural disasters.   Any of these risks could adversely affect our ability to conduct operations or result in substantial losses to us as a result of:   · injury or loss of life;   · damage to and destruction of property and equipment;   · damage to natural resources due to underground migration of hydraulic fracturing fluids;   · pollution and other environmental damage, including spillage or mishandling of recovered hydraulic fracturing fluids;   · regulatory investigations and penalties;   · suspension of our operations; and   · repair and remediation costs.   We may elect not to obtain insurance if we believe that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented. In addition, pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable. The occurrence of an event that is not covered or not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our production, revenues and results of operations.   Competition in the oil and natural gas industry is intense, making it more difficult for us to acquire properties, market oil and natural gas and secure trained personnel.   We operate in a highly competitive environment for acquiring properties, marketing oil and natural gas and securing trained personnel. Many of our competitors possess and employ financial, technical and personnel resources substantially greater than ours, which can be particularly important in the areas in which we operate. Those companies may be able to pay more for productive oil and natural gas properties and exploratory prospects and to evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects   28             than our financial or personnel resources permit. In addition, those companies may be able to offer better compensation packages to attract and retain qualified personnel than we are able to offer. The cost to attract and retain qualified personnel has increased over the past few years due to competition and may increase substantially in the future. Our ability to acquire additional prospects and to find and develop reserves in the future will depend on our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment. Also, there is substantial competition for capital available for investment in the oil and natural gas industry. We may not be able to compete successfully in the future in acquiring prospective reserves, developing reserves, marketing hydrocarbons, attracting and retaining quality personnel and raising additional capital. Our failure to acquire properties, market oil and natural gas and secure trained personnel and adequately compensate personnel could have a material adverse effect on our production, revenues and results of operations.   Market conditions or operational impediments may hinder our access to oil and natural gas markets or delay our production.   Market conditions or the unavailability of satisfactory oil and natural gas processing or transportation arrangements may hinder our access to oil, natural gas and NGL markets or delay our production. The availability of a ready market for our oil and natural gas production depends on a number of factors, including the demand for and supply of oil, natural gas and NGLs, the proximity of reserves to pipelines and terminal facilities, competition for such facilities and the inability of such facilities to gather, transport or process our production due to shutdowns or curtailments arising from mechanical, operational or weather related matters, including hurricanes and other severe weather conditions. Our ability to market our production depends in substantial part on the availability and capacity of gathering and transportation systems, pipelines and processing facilities owned and operated by third parties. Our failure to obtain such services on acceptable terms could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may be required to shut in or otherwise curtail production from wells due to lack of a market or inadequacy or unavailability of oil, NGL or natural gas pipeline or gathering, transportation or processing capacity. If that were to occur, then we would be unable to realize revenue from those wells until suitable arrangements were made to market our production.   We are subject to complex federal, state, local and other laws and regulations that could adversely affect the cost, timing, manner or feasibility of conducting our operations.   Our oil and natural gas exploration, development and production, and related saltwater disposal operations are subject to complex and stringent laws and regulations. In order to conduct our operations in compliance with these laws and regulations, we must obtain and maintain numerous permits, approvals and certificates from various federal, state, local and governmental authorities. We may incur substantial costs and experience delays in order to maintain compliance with these existing laws and regulations. In addition, our costs of compliance may increase or our operations may be otherwise adversely affected if existing laws and regulations are revised or reinterpreted, or if new laws and regulations become applicable to our operations. These and other costs could have a material adverse effect on our production, revenues and results of operations.   Our business is subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations as interpreted and enforced by governmental authorities possessing jurisdiction over various aspects of the exploration for, and the production of, oil and natural gas. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations, as interpreted and enforced, could have a material adverse effect on our production, revenues and results of operations.   Certain federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to oil and natural gas exploration and development may be eliminated as a result of future legislation.   President Obama’s budget proposal for the fiscal year 2013 recommended the elimination of certain key United States federal income tax preferences currently available to oil and natural gas exploration and production companies. These changes include, but are not limited to, (i) the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and natural gas properties, (ii) the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs and (iii) the increase in the amortization period from two years to seven years for geophysical costs paid or incurred in connection with the exploration for, or development of, oil or natural gas within the United States.   It is unclear whether any such changes will actually be enacted or, if enacted, how soon any such changes could become effective. The passage of any legislation as a result of the budget proposal or any other similar change in United States federal income tax law could affect certain tax deductions that are currently available to us with respect to our oil and natural gas exploration and production activities.    29             Climate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of “greenhouse gases” could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the crude oil and natural gas that we produce.   In December 2009, the EPA determined that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other “greenhouse gases” present an endangerment to public health and the environment because emissions of such gases are, according to the EPA, contributing to warming of the earth’s atmosphere and other climatic changes. Based on these findings, the EPA has begun adopting and implementing regulations to restrict emissions of greenhouse gases under existing provisions of the CAA. The EPA recently adopted two sets of rules regulating greenhouse gas emissions under the CAA, one of which requires a reduction in emissions of greenhouse gases from motor vehicles and the other of which regulates emissions of greenhouse gases from certain large stationary sources, effective January 2, 2011. The EPA’s rules relating to emissions of greenhouse gases, including emissions, from large stationary sources are currently subject to a number of legal challenges, but the federal courts have thus far declined to issue any injunctions to prevent EPA from implementing, or requiring state environmental agencies to implement, the rules. The EPA has also adopted rules requiring the reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from specified large greenhouse gas emission sources in the United States, including certain onshore oil and natural gas production facilities, on an annual basis, beginning in 2012 for emissions occurring in 2011.   In addition, Congress has from time to time considered adopting legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and almost one-half of the states have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases primarily through the planned development of greenhouse gas emission inventories and/or regional greenhouse gas cap and trade programs. Most of these cap and trade programs work by requiring major sources of emissions, such as electric power plants, or major producers of fuels, such as refineries and gas processing plants, to acquire and surrender emission allowances. The number of allowances available for purchase is reduced each year in an effort to achieve the overall greenhouse gas emission reduction goal.   The adoption of legislation or regulatory programs to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases could require us to incur increased operating costs, such as costs to purchase and operate emissions control systems, to acquire emissions allowances or comply with new regulatory or reporting requirements. Any such legislation or regulatory programs could also increase the cost of consuming, and thereby reduce demand for, the oil and natural gas we produced. Consequently, legislation and regulatory programs to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Finally, it should be noted that some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the earth’s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, and floods and other climatic events. If any such effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.   The recent adoption of derivatives legislation by Congress could have an adverse effect on our ability to use derivative instruments to reduce the effect of commodity price, interest rate and other risks associated with our business.   Congress recently adopted comprehensive financial reform legislation that establishes federal oversight and regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market and entities, including us, which participate in that market. The new legislation, known as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”), became law on July 21, 2010 and requires the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (the “CFTC”) and the SEC to promulgate rules and regulations implementing the new legislation within 360 days from the date of enactment. In its rulemaking under the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFTC has proposed regulations to set position limits for certain futures and option contracts in the major energy markets and for swaps that are their economic equivalents. Certain bona fide hedging transactions or positions would be exempt from these position limits. It is not possible at this time to predict when the CFTC will finalize these regulations. The financial reform legislation may also require us to comply with margin requirements and with certain clearing and trade-execution requirements in connection with our derivative activities, although the application of those provisions to us is uncertain at this time. The financial reform legislation may also require the counterparties to our derivative instruments to spin off some of their derivatives activities to a separate entity, which may not be as creditworthy as the current counterparty. The new legislation and any new regulations could significantly increase the cost of derivative contracts (including through requirements to post collateral which could adversely affect our available liquidity), materially alter the terms of derivative contracts, reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against risks we encounter, reduce our ability to monetize or restructure our existing derivative contracts, and increase our exposure to less creditworthy counterparties. If we reduce our use of derivatives as a result of the legislation and regulations, our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable, which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures. Finally, the legislation was intended, in part, to reduce the volatility of commodity prices, which some legislators attributed to speculative trading in derivatives and commodity instruments related to oil and natural gas. Our revenues could therefore be adversely affected if a consequence of the legislation and regulations is to lower commodity prices. Any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on us, our financial condition and our results of operations.    30             The loss of our chief executive officer or other key personnel could negatively impact our ability to execute our business strategy.   We depend, and will continue to depend in the foreseeable future, on the services of our chief executive officer, Timothy A. Leach, and other officers and key employees who have extensive experience and expertise in evaluating and analyzing producing oil and natural gas properties and drilling prospects, maximizing production from oil and natural gas properties, marketing oil and natural gas production, and developing and executing acquisition, financing and hedging strategies. Our ability to hire and retain our officers and key employees is important to our continued success and growth. The unexpected loss of the services of one or more of these individuals could negatively impact our ability to execute our business strategy.   Because we do not operate and therefore control the development of certain of the properties in which we own interests, we may not be able to produce economic quantities of oil and natural gas in a timely manner.    At December 31, 2012, approximately 8.4 percent of our proved reserves were attributable to properties for which we were not the operator. As a result, the success and timing of drilling and development activities on such nonoperated properties depend upon a number of factors, including:   · the nature and timing of drilling and operational activities;   · the timing and amount of capital expenditures;   · the operators’ expertise and financial resources;   · the approval of other participants in such properties; and   · the selection and application of suitable technology.   If drilling and development activities are not conducted on these properties or are not conducted on a timely basis, we may be unable to increase our production or offset normal production declines or we will be required to write-off the reserves attributable thereto, which may adversely affect our production, revenues and results of operations. Any such write-offs of our reserves could reduce our ability to borrow money and could reduce the value of our securities   Uncertainties associated with enhanced recovery methods may result in us not realizing an acceptable return on our investments in such projects.   We inject water into formations on some of our properties to increase the production of oil and natural gas. We may in the future expand these efforts to more of our properties or employ other enhanced recovery methods in our operations. The additional production and reserves, if any, attributable to the use of enhanced recovery methods are inherently difficult to predict. If our enhanced recovery methods do not allow for the extraction of oil and natural gas in a manner or to the extent that we anticipate, we may not realize an acceptable return on our investments in such projects. In addition, if proposed legislation and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing become law, the cost of some of these enhanced recovery methods could increase substantially.   A terrorist attack or armed conflict could harm our business by decreasing our revenues and increasing our costs.   Terrorist activities, anti-terrorist efforts and other armed conflict involving the United States may adversely affect the United States and global economies and could prevent us from meeting our financial and other obligations. If any of these events occur or escalate, the resulting political instability and societal disruption could reduce overall demand for oil and natural gas, potentially putting downward pressure on demand for our production and causing a reduction in our revenue. Oil and natural gas related facilities could be direct targets of terrorist attacks, and our operations could be adversely impacted if significant infrastructure or facilities used for the production, transportation, processing or marketing of oil and natural gas production are destroyed or damaged. Costs for insurance and other security may increase as a result of these threats, and some insurance coverage may become more difficult to obtain, if available at all.       31             Risks Relating to Our Common Stock   Our restated certificate of incorporation, our bylaws and Delaware law contain provisions that could discourage acquisition bids or merger proposals, which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.   Our restated certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval. If our board of directors elects to issue preferred stock, it could be more difficult for a third party to acquire us. In addition, some provisions of our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws and Delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us, even if the change of control would be beneficial to our stockholders, including:   · the organization of our board of directors as a classified board, which allows no more than approximately one-third of our directors to be elected each year;   · stockholders cannot remove directors from our board of directors except for cause and then only by the holders of not less than 66 2/3 percent of the voting power of all outstanding voting stock;   · the prohibition of stockholder action by written consent; and   · limitations on the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings and establish advance notice provisions for stockholder proposals and nominations for elections to the board of directors to be acted upon at meetings of stockholders.   Because we have no plans to pay dividends on our common stock, investors must look solely to stock appreciation for a return on their investment in us.   We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. We currently intend to retain all future earnings to fund the development and growth of our business. Any payment of future dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on, among other things, our earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, level of indebtedness, statutory and contractual restrictions applying to the payment of dividends and other considerations that our board of directors deems relevant. Covenants contained in our credit facility and the indentures governing our senior notes restrict the payment of dividends. Investors must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize a return on their investment. Investors seeking cash dividends should not purchase our common stock.   The availability of shares for sale in the future could reduce the market price of our common stock.   In the future, we may issue securities to raise cash for acquisitions. We may also acquire interests in other companies by using a combination of cash and our common stock or just our common stock. We may also issue securities convertible into, or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, our common stock. Any of these events may dilute your ownership interest in our company, reduce our earnings per share and have an adverse impact on the price of our common stock.   In addition, sales of a substantial amount of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales may occur, could reduce the market price of our common stock. This could also impair our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of our securities.   Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments
