Item 1A. Risk Factors.GeneralNoble Energy, Inc. (Noble Energy, the Company, we or us) is a leading independent energy company engaged in worldwide oil and gas exploration and production. Founded in 1932, Noble Energy is a Delaware corporation, incorporated in 1969, and has been publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) since 1980. We have a unique history of growth, evolving from a regional crude oil and natural gas producer to a global exploration and production company included in the S&P 500. Our purpose, Energizing the World, Bettering People's Lives®, reflects our commitment to find and deliver energy through crude oil and natural gas exploration and production while embracing our responsibility to contribute to the betterment of people's lives in the communities in which we operate. We strive to build trust through stakeholder engagement, act on our values, provide a safe work environment, respect our environment and care for our people and the communities where we operate.We aim to achieve sustainable growth in value and cash flow through exploration success and the development of a high-quality, diversified portfolio of assets with investment flexibility between: onshore unconventional developments and offshore organic exploration leading to major development projects; US and international projects; and production mix among crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGLs). Exploration success, along with development capital investment in the US and in international locations such as West Africa and the Eastern Mediterranean, has resulted in a visible lineup of major development projects which positions us for substantial future reserves, production and cash flow growth. Occasional strategic acquisitions of producing and non-producing properties, combined with the periodic divestment of non-core assets, have allowed us to achieve our objective of a well diversified, growing portfolio. During 2013, we spent over $3 billion in oil and gas exploration and development activities in the US, and approximately $1 billion in international locations.Our portfolio is diversified between short-term and long-term projects, both onshore and offshore, domestic and international. Our organization and business model is focused on sustainable, high return growth through the pursuit of material exploration opportunities which can be monetized on a competitive discovery-to-production cycle through effective major development project execution. During 2013, two major offshore development projects, Tamar, offshore Israel, and Alen, offshore Equatorial Guinea, began production. Our ability to deliver major development projects on schedule and within budget has provided a competitive and financial advantage in the industry. Onshore US assets provide a stable base of production along with high return, low risk development programs that deliver growth and accommodate flexible capital spending that can be adjusted in response to ongoing changes in the economic environment. We continue to enhance project performance through technology and operational efficiency. Our long cycle offshore development projects, while requiring multi-year capital investment, are expected to offer attractive financial returns, and sustained production and cash flow.We have operations in five core areas: These five core areas provide:l the DJ Basin (onshore US); l the majority of our crude oil, natural gas and NGL production;l the Marcellus Shale (onshore US); l visible growth from major development projects; andl the deepwater Gulf of Mexico (offshore US); l numerous exploration opportunities.l offshore West Africa; and  l offshore Eastern Mediterranean.  Our growth is supported by a strong balance sheet and liquidity levels. We strive to deliver competitive returns and a growing dividend. Our annual cash dividends have increased 67% in the last five years, from 33 cents per share in 2008 to 55 cents per share in 2013 (as adjusted for the 2-for-1 stock split during the second quarter of 2013).

Selected Financial Data for additional financial and operating information for fiscal years 2009-2013.2Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsIn this report, unless otherwise indicated or where the context otherwise requires, information includes that of Noble Energy and its subsidiaries. All references to production, sales volumes and reserves quantities are net to our interest unless otherwise indicated.Major Development Project Inventory We continue to advance a number of major development projects, many of which have resulted from our exploration success. Each project will progress, as appropriate, through the various development phases including appraisal, front-end engineering and design, development drilling, construction and production. We currently have projects in all phases of the development cycle with some contributing production growth in 2013. Although these projects will require significant capital investments over the next several years, they typically offer long-life, sustained cash flows and attractive financial returns. Our current major development projects resulting from exploration success and strategic acquisitions include the following:Sanctioned(1) ProjectsUnsanctioned Projects    ·Horizontal Niobrara (onshore US) (2)·Leviathan (offshore Israel)·Marcellus Shale (onshore US) (2)·Cyprus (offshore Cyprus)·Gunflint (deepwater Gulf of Mexico)·Diega and Carla (offshore Equatorial Guinea)·Big Bend (deepwater Gulf of Mexico)·Dantzler (deepwater Gulf of Mexico)·Tamar Expansion (offshore Israel)  ·Tamar Southwest (offshore Israel)  (1) Final investment decision has been made.(2) Represents multiple ongoing development projects.

Given commodity price disparities, the price for a barrel of crude oil equivalent for natural gas is significantly less than the price for a barrel of crude oil. The price for a barrel of NGL is also less than the price for a barrel of crude oil. See Item 6. Selected Financial Data.(2) Other international includes the North Sea and China.3Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsTotal proved reserves as of December 31, 2013 were approximately 1,406 MMBoe, a 19% increase from 2012. Our proved reserves are 55% US and 45% international. The proved reserves mix is 31% global liquids (crude oil and NGLs), 38% international natural gas, and 31% US natural gas.See Proved Reserves Disclosures, below, and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Supplemental Oil and Gas Information (Unaudited) for further discussion of proved reserves.Crude Oil and Natural Gas Properties and Activities We search for crude oil and natural gas properties onshore and offshore, and seek to acquire exploration rights and conduct exploration activities in numerous areas of interest. These activities include geophysical and geological evaluation, analysis of commercial, regulatory and political risk and exploratory drilling, where appropriate. Our properties consist primarily of interests in developed and undeveloped crude oil and natural gas leases and concessions. We also own natural gas processing plants and natural gas gathering and other crude oil and natural gas-related pipeline systems. These assets are primarily used in the processing and transportation of our crude oil, natural gas and NGL production. Exploration Activities We primarily focus on organic growth from exploration and development drilling, concentrating on basins or plays where we have strategic competitive advantages, emanating from proprietary seismic data and operational expertise, and which we believe will generate superior returns. We have had substantial exploration success onshore US, in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, the Douala Basin offshore West Africa and the Levant Basin offshore Eastern Mediterranean, resulting in our significant portfolio of major development projects. We have numerous exploration opportunities remaining in these areas and are also engaged in new venture activity in both the US and international locations. Our focus on exploration activities has created a sustainable exploration program. During 2013, we advanced our exploration activities in the following new venture areas: onshore US in northeast Nevada, offshore Falkland Islands, offshore Nicaragua, and offshore Sierra Leone.Appraisal, Development and Production Activities Our discoveries and strategic acquisitions in recent years have provided us with numerous appraisal, development, and production opportunities, as demonstrated in our growing inventory of major development projects. In 2013, we commenced natural gas production from the Tamar field, offshore Israel, followed by the start up of Alen, a natural gas and condensate field, offshore Equatorial Guinea. Additionally, we continued to make significant progress on our ongoing onshore US and other major development projects.Acquisition and Divestiture Activities We maintain an ongoing portfolio management program. Accordingly, we may engage in acquisitions of additional crude oil or natural gas properties and related assets through either direct acquisitions of the assets or acquisitions of entities owning the assets. We may also periodically divest non-core, non-strategic assets.Non-Core Divestiture Program Our non-core divestiture program is designed to generate organizational and operational efficiencies as well as cash for use in our capital investment program. Divestitures of non-core properties allow us to allocate capital and employee resources to high-value and high-growth areas. The program has generated combined net proceeds of approximately $1.4 billion during the last two years, including $206 million during 2013. The proceeds from divestitures provide additional flexibility in the implementation of our international and deepwater Gulf of Mexico exploration and development programs and our horizontal drilling activities in the DJ Basin and Marcellus Shale.During 2013, we sold onshore US crude oil and natural gas properties located in Kansas, Oklahoma, the Gulf Coast, New Mexico and Wyoming, and non-operated working interests in the North Sea.See Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 3. Acquisitions and Divestitures. Asset Impairments During 2013, we recorded impairment charges of $86 million primarily related to our Mari-B field, offshore Israel, due to natural field decline, and certain non-core onshore US properties divested during the year or held for sale at December 31, 2013. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 4. Asset Impairments.4Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsUnited StatesWe have been engaged in crude oil and natural gas exploration and development activities throughout onshore US since 1932 and in the Gulf of Mexico since 1968. US operations accounted for 58% of 2013 total consolidated sales volumes and 55% of total proved reserves at December 31, 2013. Approximately 57% of the proved reserves are natural gas and 43% are crude oil, condensate and NGLs.Sales of production and estimates of proved reserves for our US operating areas were as follows:   Year Ended December 31, 2013 December 31, 2013  Sales Volumes Proved Reserves  Crude Oil &Condensate NaturalGas NGLs Total Crude Oil &Condensate NaturalGas NGLs Total  (MBbl/d) (MMcf/d) (MBbl/d) (MBoe/d) (MMBbls) (Bcf) (MMBbls) (MMBoe)DJ Basin 46 209 14 95 206 1,044 72 450Marcellus Shale — 139 1 24 1 1,374 22 252Deepwater Gulf of Mexico 16 13 1 19 28 33 1 35Other Onshore US 1 79 — 15 2 205 — 37Total 63 440 16 153 237 2,656 95 774Wells drilled in 2013 and productive wells at December 31, 2013 for our US operating areas were as follows:   Year Ended December 31, 2013 December 31, 2013  Gross Wells Drilledor Participated in (1) Gross ProductiveWellsDJ Basin 470 8,383Marcellus Shale 117 284Deepwater Gulf of Mexico 2 13Other Onshore US 23 3,632Total 612 12,312(1) Excludes exploratory wells drilled and suspended awaiting a sanctioned development plan or being evaluated to assess the economic viability of the well. See Drilling Activity, below.5Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements Locations of our onshore US operations as of December 31, 2013 are shown on the map below:DJ Basin With the advent of horizontal drilling technology, the DJ Basin is now recognized by many industry analysts as a premier US crude oil resource play and is a key driver of our production and cash flow growth. It is our largest onshore US field (approximately 730,000 net acres), split between approximately 609,000 net acres in Colorado (approximately 96% operated working interest) and approximately 121,000 net acres in Wyoming (the majority non-operated). We have an extensive inventory of development drilling opportunities and plan to invest approximately 40% of our 2014 capital investment program in the DJ Basin.The DJ Basin contributed an average of 95 MBoe/d of sales volumes, representing approximately 36% of total consolidated sales volumes in 2013, with approximately 63% being crude oil and NGLs, and represented approximately 32% of total proved reserves at December 31, 2013.DJ Basin Acreage Exchange In October 2013, we closed an acreage exchange agreement with another operator related to our position in the DJ Basin. We exchanged approximately 50,000 net acres which consolidates our acreage position providing the opportunity to optimize drilling, production, and gathering activities and increase the number of extended-reach lateral wells in our development program. A short-term reduction in production of approximately 8 MBoe/d for fourth quarter 2013 related to the acreage exchange is anticipated to be quickly offset with operational efficiencies and cost savings. The transaction was accounted for at net book value, with no gain or loss recognized. We received $105 million in cash related to reimbursement of capital expenditures and other normal closing adjustments from the effective date of January 1, 2013, to closing date. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 3. Property Transactions.2013 Activity  Over the past year, we have focused our drilling and development activity on Integrated Development Plan (IDP) areas. This approach allows us to consolidate processing and handling infrastructure across large areas (typically 30,000 to 60,000 acres). With this approach, we construct multi-well horizontal drilling pads and centralized processing facilities (CPFs) to minimize our surface use. The drilling pads and CPFs facilitate efficient execution and operations by reducing our land surface and water usage while enabling us to efficiently gather and process crude oil, natural gas, and water from a large surrounding area, and reducing truck traffic and our overall surface footprint. We sanctioned the Wells Ranch IDP in 2012, and brought online our first CPF at Wells Ranch during the fourth quarter of 2013. In 2013, we sanctioned the East Pony IDP in northern Colorado and expect to sanction additional IDPs over the next several years. In the second half of 2014, we will begin operation of the Keota plant, our second natural gas processing plant in northern Colorado, to support our East Pony IDP along with future IDPs in the area. This will enhance our ability to continue development in this part of the Basin. 6Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsAlso during 2013, we spud a total of 295 development wells, of which 291 were horizontal wells in the Niobrara and Codell formations. We continue to evaluate impacts of changes in well spacing and pad design. The well numbers above include 34 extended-reach (over 5,000 feet) lateral wells. We also participated in approximately 170 non-operated development wells during 2013.In conjunction with our IDP approach, infrastructure in the area continues to be built out. Several infrastructure projects will come online over the next year and will significantly improve our flow assurance and reduce truck traffic. In the fourth quarter of 2013, a new crude oil gathering pipeline began operations. The new pipeline allows us to move crude oil from the northern parts of the field to several oil processing facilities and transportation hubs, with additional access to end markets. Additionally, a new rail facility commenced operations during the fourth quarter of 2013 to further enhance the transportation of our crude oil out of the field. Our 2013 DJ Basin development program resulted in additions to proved reserves of approximately 153 MMBoe, approximately 67% of which are crude oil and NGLs.Marcellus Shale The Marcellus Shale represents our second onshore US core area. We have a 50-50 joint development agreement with CONSOL Energy Inc. (CONSOL) in approximately 700,000 gross acres in southwest Pennsylvania and northwest West Virginia, including approximately 90,000 gross acres recently acquired to expand our acreage position in northwest West Virginia to further optimize the value of our existing acreage position. We operate the wet gas (natural gas containing more liquid hydrocarbons) development area while CONSOL operates the dry gas (natural gas containing less liquid hydrocarbons) development area. The Marcellus Shale contributed an average of 139 MMcfe/d of sales volumes and represented approximately 9% of total consolidated sales volumes in 2013 and approximately 18% of total proved reserves at December 31, 2013.During 2013, we and CONSOL drilled 71 wet gas wells and 46 dry gas wells and brought online 35 wet gas wells and 18 dry gas wells.Utilizing an IDP concept, modeled after the DJ Basin, we have begun to realize cost efficiencies through longer lateral wells and increased production growth through applied learning, completion design and optimized well placement. The current identified IDP areas are Majorsville, Southwest Pennsylvania Area Dry, and Allegheny County Airport. Majorsville is the first operated IDP area, which came online in 2013 and will be the IDP model for the Marcellus Shale. It is in the core operating area with water and marketing infrastructure in place to support further development.Based on our 2014 joint development plan, we expect to invest approximately 20% of our 2014 capital investment program in the Marcellus Shale.Northeast Nevada Exploration Prospect We have an active global new venture process focused on identifying additional exploration opportunities with reasonable entry cost, significant running room and the potential to become a new core area. In the onshore US, this effort has captured a 370,000 net acre position (66% fee acreage and remainder federal acreage) in northeast Nevada, prospective for crude oil exploration, which we identified through basin scale reconnaissance and innovative geoscience concepts. Based on acquired 3D seismic data over portions of the acreage, we began our exploratory drilling program with two exploratory wells drilled in 2013. We are currently evaluating the drilling results.Other Non-Core Onshore Properties We also operate in the following onshore US areas: Rocky Mountains including Piceance Basin (western Colorado), Bowdoin field (north central Montana), Tri-State field (northeastern Colorado, northwestern Kansas and southwestern Nebraska) and Powder River Basin (north/central Wyoming); and Gulf Coast including the Haynesville field (East Texas and North Louisiana), Comanche Plains field (West Texas). Other non-core onshore properties accounted for 6% of total consolidated sales volumes in 2013 and 3% of total proved reserves at December 31, 2013. During 2013, we sold various non-core onshore properties and continue to evaluate the divestment opportunities associated with other non-core properties. See Acquisition and Divestiture Activities – Non-Core Divestiture Program above.7Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsDeepwater Gulf of Mexico Locations of our operations in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico as of December 31, 2013 are shown on the map below:Noble Energy was one of the first independent producers to explore in the Gulf of Mexico. We acquired our first offshore block in 1968, and today the deepwater Gulf of Mexico is one of our five core operating areas. Our focus is on high-impact opportunities with the potential to provide significant medium and long-term growth. We have six producing fields, multiple ongoing development projects and a substantial inventory of exploration opportunities.The deepwater Gulf of Mexico accounted for 7% of total consolidated sales volumes in 2013 and 2% of total proved reserves at December 31, 2013. We currently hold leases on 121 deepwater Gulf of Mexico blocks, representing approximately 52,000 net developed acres and approximately 409,000 net undeveloped acres. We are the operator on approximately 68% of our leases. See also Developed and Undeveloped Acreage – Future Acreage Expirations, below. During 2013, we sanctioned two major development projects in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, Gunflint and Big Bend. See details below.Deepwater Gulf of Mexico Exploration Program Our deepwater Gulf of Mexico operations resulted from lease acquisition, expansion of our 3D seismic database, and an active drilling program. We currently have an inventory of 20 identified prospects, which are a combination of both high impact subsalt prospects and smaller, high value tie-back opportunities. The prospects are subject to an ongoing technical maturation process and may or may not emerge as drillable options. To support the future exploration, appraisal, and development work, we have the ENSCO 8501 rig under contract through the third quarter of 2014. The Atwood Advantage drillship is currently mobilizing to the Gulf of Mexico. It will be used in the 2014 drilling plan which includes various exploration, appraisal and well completion activities.Our most significant deepwater Gulf of Mexico properties and current development plans are discussed in more detail below.Rio Grande (Mississippi Canyon Block 698, 699, 738 and 782) The Rio Grande area is a co-development opportunity for recent exploration successes in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Big Bend (54% operated working interest) is a 2012 crude oil discovery, Troubadour (60% operated working interest) is a 2013 natural gas discovery, and Dantzler (45% operated working interest) is a 2013 crude oil discovery. In October 2013, we sanctioned the development plan for Big Bend utilizing a subsea 8Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statementstieback to a third party host facility, with first production targeted for late 2015. We are currently evaluating possible integration of the Dantzler, potentially a 2014 sanctioned project, and Troubadour discoveries into our Rio Grande development plans.Gunflint (Mississippi Canyon Block 948; 26% operated working interest) Gunflint is a 2008 crude oil discovery. During 2013, we completed drilling our second appraisal well and sanctioned the development plan for Gunflint utilizing a subsea tieback to an existing host facility. First production from Gunflint is targeted for 2016.Galapagos Development Project including Isabela (Mississippi Canyon Block 562; 33.33% non-operated working interest), Santa Cruz (Mississippi Canyon Blocks 519/563; 23.25% operated working interest) and Santiago (Mississippi Canyon Block 519; 23.25% operated working interest) The Galapagos crude oil development project consists of Isabela, a 2007 discovery, Santa Cruz, a 2009 discovery, and Santiago, a 2011 discovery. The Galapagos development began producing in 2012 and is connected to existing infrastructure through subsea tiebacks.Other Offshore Properties Raton (Mississippi Canyon Block 248; 67% operated working interest) is a 2006 natural gas discovery and has been producing since 2008. South Raton (Mississippi Canyon Block 292; 79% operated working interest) is a 2008 crude oil discovery and began producing in 2012. Both Raton and South Raton are currently shut-in due to mechanical issues. We are currently awaiting access to the third party processing platform to begin remediation efforts on the South Raton well. Swordfish (Viosca Knoll Blocks 917, 961 and 962; 85% operated working interest) is a 2001 crude oil discovery and began producing in 2005. The Swordfish project currently includes two producing wells. We recently acquired the Neptune Spar, a floating offshore production platform, which will process our remaining Swordfish production. Ticonderoga (Green Canyon Block 768; 50% non-operated working interest) is a 2004 crude oil discovery and began producing in 2006. The project currently includes four producing wells, including one drilled in 2013. Lorien (Green Canyon Block 199; 60% operated working interest) is a 2003 crude oil discovery and began producing in 2006. The project currently includes one producing well. Other offshore properties are connected to existing infrastructure through subsea tiebacks.InternationalOur international business focuses on offshore opportunities in a number of countries and provides diversity to our portfolio. Development projects in Equatorial Guinea and Israel have contributed substantially to our growth over the last decade.During 2013, we successfully brought the Tamar project, offshore Israel, and Alen project, offshore Equatorial Guinea, to production as we continue to advance our major development projects. Additionally, significant exploration successes offshore West Africa, Israel and Cyprus have identified multiple major development projects that are expected to contribute to production growth in the future. We expect these large acreage positions in West Africa and the Eastern Mediterranean will provide further exploration opportunities.International operations accounted for 42% of total consolidated sales volumes in 2013 and 45% of total proved reserves at December 31, 2013. International proved reserves are approximately 84% natural gas and 16% crude oil and condensate. Based on our current 2014 capital investment program, we expect to invest approximately 20% of our 2014 capital investment program in international locations. Operations in China, Cyprus, Equatorial Guinea, and Sierra Leone are conducted in accordance with the terms of production sharing contracts (PSCs). In Cameroon, we operate in accordance with the terms of a PSC and a mining concession. Operations in Israel, Nicaragua, the Falkland Islands, the North Sea, and other foreign locations are conducted in accordance with concession agreements, permits or licenses. See Item 1A.

Equatorial Guinea, the only producing country in our West Africa segment, accounted for approximately 28% of 2013 total consolidated sales volumes and 15% of total proved reserves at December 31, 2013. We held approximately 118,000 net developed acres and 80,000 net undeveloped acres in Equatorial Guinea, 695,000 net undeveloped acres in Cameroon, and 414,000 net undeveloped acres in Sierra Leone at December 31, 2013.Locations of our operations in West Africa as of December 31, 2013 are shown on the map below:Alen Project Alen, our second major operated development project in West Africa, is a natural gas and condensate field primarily on Block O (45% operated working interest), offshore Equatorial Guinea. Alen began production in the second half of 2013, ahead of the original target start up date, and utilizes the Aseng FPSO for storage and offloading. Alen exited 2013 with production of 28 MBbl/d, and peak production of 30 to 35 MBbl/d is expected in 2014. Aseng Project   Aseng is a crude oil field on Block I (40% operated working interest), offshore Equatorial Guinea, which includes five horizontal wells flowing to the Aseng FPSO. Aseng started production in late 2011. The oil is stored on the Aseng FPSO until sold, while the natural gas and water are reinjected into the reservoir to maintain pressure and maximize oil recoveries.The Aseng FPSO is designed to act as an oil production hub, as well as liquids storage and offloading facility, with capabilities to support future subsea oil field developments in the area. It also has the ability to process and store condensate from natural gas condensate fields in the area, the first of which is Alen. It is capable of processing 120 MBbl/d of liquids, including 80 MBbl/d of oil, and reinjection of up to 160 MMcf/d of natural gas. The Aseng FPSO has storage capacity of approximately 1.6 MMBbls of liquids. During 2013, Aseng maintained reliable and safe performance and averaged almost 99% production uptime.Alba Field  We have a 34% non-operated working interest in the Alba field, offshore Equatorial Guinea, which has been producing since 1991. Operations include the Alba field and related production and condensate storage facilities, an LPG processing plant where additional condensate is extracted along with LPGs, and a methanol plant capable of producing up to 3,100 gross metric tons per day. The LPG processing plant and the methanol plant are located on Bioko Island, Equatorial Guinea. We sell our share of natural gas production from the Alba field to the LPG plant, the methanol plant and an unaffiliated LNG plant. The LPG plant is owned by Alba Plant LLC (Alba Plant), in which we have a 28% interest accounted for as an equity method investment. The methanol plant is owned by Atlantic Methanol Production Company, LLC (AMPCO), in which we have a 45% interest, also accounted for as an equity method investment. AMPCO purchases natural gas from the Alba field under a contract that runs through 2026 and subsequently markets the produced methanol primarily to customers in the US and Europe. Alba Plant sells its LPG products and condensate at our marine terminal at prevailing market prices. We sell our share of condensate produced in the Alba field under short-term contracts at market-based prices. The execution phase of the Alba field B3 compression project began in early 2013 with an anticipated completion date in 2016.11Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsOther Block O & I Projects We are continuing our exploration and appraisal efforts offshore Equatorial Guinea. During the second half of 2013, we successfully drilled the Diega I-8 appraisal well, and we are targeting to sanction a development project in 2014, with first production targeted for 2016.We continue to review the drilling results of the Carla O-7 and the Carla I-7 wells and evaluate regional development scenarios for the Carla discovery.West Africa Gas Project We have a natural gas development team working with Equatorial Guinea's Ministry of Mines, Industry and Energy to evaluate several monetization options for natural gas in the region. Cameroon We have an interest in over one million gross undeveloped acres offshore Cameroon, which include the YoYo mining concession (50% operating working interest) and Tilapia PSC (66.67% operating working interest). The YoYo-1 exploratory well was drilled in 2007, discovering natural gas and condensate. We are working with the government of Cameroon to evaluate natural gas development options.Sierra Leone We participate in two offshore exploration blocks, SL 8A-10 and SL 8B-10, covering almost 1.4 million gross undeveloped acres. Under the terms of the award, Chevron (SL) Ltd. is the operator and we have a non-operated 30% working interest. During 2013, we acquired and began processing 766 square miles of 2D seismic information over portions of the acreage to assist with our 3D seismic plans.Eastern Mediterranean (Israel and Cyprus) The Eastern Mediterranean is one of our core operating areas, where we have had eight consecutive natural gas discoveries in recent years. We plan to explore for additional natural gas prospects as well as for crude oil, which may exist at greater depths in the basin.Israel, the only producing country in our Eastern Mediterranean core area, accounted for 13% of 2013 total consolidated sales volumes and 30% of total proved reserves at December 31, 2013. Our leasehold position in the Eastern Mediterranean includes four leases and seven licenses offshore Israel and one license offshore Cyprus, and we are the operator of the properties at December 31, 2013. We held approximately 80,000 net developed acres and 326,000 net undeveloped acres located between 10 and 90 miles offshore Israel in water depths ranging from 700 feet to 6,500 feet. The license offshore Cyprus covers approximately 596,000 net undeveloped acres adjacent to our Israel acreage.Locations of our operations in the Eastern Mediterranean as of December 31, 2013 are shown below: Domestic Natural Gas Demand   As the Israeli economy continues to grow, so does the demand for natural gas, used primarily for electricity generation. Demand for natural gas in the industrial sector, including refineries, chemical, desalination, cement and other plants, is also increasing. These sectors are gaining confidence that a long-term supply of natural gas will be available and are now investing the capital necessary to convert facilities to use natural gas. We expect that government requirements for emissions reductions could also drive incremental demand for natural gas as a fuel in the future.12Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsNatural Gas Export   As discussed below, we have made significant natural gas discoveries in the Eastern Mediterranean. We expect that these discoveries can be used to satisfy growing domestic demand as well as provide significant export potential. Eastern Mediterranean export projects would be well positioned to supply growing regional and global natural gas demand, and, as discussed further below, we are considering multiple development options. The government of Israel recently finalized an export policy. See Regulations – Update on Israel's Natural Gas Policy, below.Tamar Natural Gas Project Just over four years from discovery, the Tamar project began production in March 2013 and is now fully operational and delivering significant volumes of natural gas to Israel. The natural gas flows from the Tamar field through the world's longest subsea tieback, more than 90 miles to the Tamar platform, and then to the Ashdod onshore terminal (AOT). Tamar is a technical and commercial milestone that significantly contributes to our production growth. Production from Tamar averaged 153 MMcf/d, net, for the year with capable peak flow rates of approximately 1.0 Bcf/d gross to support seasonal high demand periods. During 2013, we sanctioned the Tamar expansion project, which is estimated to grow our AOT capacity by 200 MMcf/d with operational start-up in the second half of 2015. Additionally, we are targeting the Tamar facility for further expansion up to 1.5 Bcf/d of capacity in 2016.The Tamar partners have executed numerous gas sale and purchase agreements (GSPAs) for the initial and expanded capacity. See International Marketing Activities and Delivery Commitments, below. Tamar Southwest  During the second half of 2013, we drilled the successful Tamar Southwest natural gas exploratory well. Tamar Southwest, which was drilled to a total depth of 17,420 feet in 5,405 feet of water, is our eighth consecutive discovery in the Levant Basin. The field is located approximately eight miles southwest of the Tamar field. We operate Tamar Southwest with a 36% working interest, and we anticipate first production in 2015 utilizing Tamar infrastructure as part of our expansion project to meet domestic demand. Tamar Southwest will also provide flow rate assurance for our overall Tamar project.Leviathan Natural Gas Project In December 2010, we announced a significant natural gas discovery at the Leviathan-1 well offshore Israel in the Levant Basin. The Leviathan field is the largest discovery in our history and was the world's largest offshore natural gas discovery in 2010. We own a 39.66% working interest in Leviathan. In 2013, the successful results from our recent Leviathan-4 appraisal well enhanced our understanding of the reservoir, and we continue our evaluation of multiple development concepts. Due to Leviathan's size, full field development is expected to require several development phases. The Leviathan Phase 1 development concept is likely to serve both domestic demand and export. Domestic production could begin as early as 2017. We and our Leviathan partners recently signed a GSPA to sell approximately 170 Bcf of natural gas over a 20-year period to the Palestine Power Generation Company (PPGC). PPGC plans to build a power plant in the West Bank.Multiple export options, including pipeline, onshore LNG, and floating LNG are under evaluation. Timing of project sanction depends on execution of natural gas sales contracts, determination of an onshore entry point and government approvals.Woodside Agreement  We and our Leviathan partners continue working with Woodside Energy Ltd. (Woodside) to reach a definitive agreement to sell portions of our working interests in the Leviathan licenses to Woodside. Such an agreement would be subject to customary government approvals. Noble expects to convey a 9.66% working interest, reducing our working interest in the Leviathan licenses to 30%. Noble would continue as upstream operator.Cyprus  During the second half of 2013, we drilled the successful Cyprus A-2 appraisal well on Block 12, offshore Cyprus. The A-2 well was drilled to a total depth of 18,865 feet in 5,575 feet of water and encountered approximately 120 feet of net natural gas pay within the targeted Miocene-aged sand intervals. We anticipate additional appraisal activities to further refine the ultimate recoverable resources and optimize field development planning. In addition to the appraisal well, we completed the acquisition phase of a 3D seismic study and are currently processing the results. We are the operator on Block 12 and hold a 70% working interest.Leviathan-1 Deep (Mesozoic Oil Target)   In January 2012, we returned to the Leviathan-1 well and began drilling toward two deeper intervals in order to evaluate them for the existence of crude oil (Leviathan-1 Deep). In May 2012, due to high pressures and the mechanical limits of the wellbore design, we suspended drilling operations. Although the well did not reach the planned objective, we are encouraged by the possibility of an active thermogenic (crude oil generating) hydrocarbon system at greater depths within the basin. We have integrated the data from the Leviathan-1 Deep well into our model to update our analysis and design a drilling plan specifically for a potential test of the deep oil concept. Mari-B, Pinnacles and Noa Fields    The Mari-B field (47% operated working interest) was the first offshore natural gas production facility in Israel and has been producing since 2004. In order to help meet Israeli natural gas demand prior to the commencement of Tamar production, we completed the Noa (47% operated working interest) and Pinnacles (47% operated working interest) wells and tied them back to the Mari-B platform in 2012. During 2013, we ramped down production from these fields when Tamar commenced production. 13Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsOther Discoveries Offshore Israel We and our partners are working on a development plan for the Dalit field (36% operated working interest), a 2009 natural gas discovery. Development would include tie-in to the Tamar platform, and we have submitted a development plan to the Israeli government. In addition, we are reviewing alternatives for the development of the Karish (47.06% operated working interest), Dolphin (39.66% operated working interest) and Tanin 1 (47.06% operated working interest) natural gas discoveries. See Regulations – Update on Israel's Natural Gas Economy.Other InternationalOur other international operations accounted for 1% of our total consolidated sales volumes for 2013 and less than 1% of total proved reserves at December 31, 2013.Falkland Islands In August 2012, we entered into an agreement with Falkland Oil and Gas Limited (FOGL) to acquire an interest in FOGL's extensive license areas, consisting of approximately 10 million gross acres located south and east of the Falkland Islands. Under the agreement, we have farmed-in to the Northern and Southern Area Licenses for a 35% working interest. In March 2013, we assumed operatorship of the Northern Area License from FOGL. In January 2014, we assumed operatorship of the Southern Area License, pending governmental approval. We continue to process recently acquired 3D seismic information for the Southern Area License and began acquisition of 3D seismic information for the Northern Area License in late 2013. The construction of our shore base facility is ongoing in preparation for our first operated exploratory well which we expect to drill in 2015.During fourth quarter 2012, FOGL drilled the Scotia exploratory well, which reached its Cretaceous objective and encountered 40 feet of net pay. Although we did not see a substantial amount of the reservoir section, virtually all sandstones with significant porosity in and below the target area contained hydrocarbons. Integration of well results with the 3D seismic information we are acquiring will allow us to assess the economic viability of this prospect. Nicaragua During the second half of 2013, we transferred a portion of our working interests in acreage offshore Nicaragua, pending government approval, to two new partners, reducing our working interest to 70%. Additionally, we drilled the Paraiso-1 exploratory well, the first deepwater well drilled offshore Nicaragua. The Paraiso-1 did not encounter commercial quantities of hydrocarbons. However, the information gathered from this well will be integrated into our regional geologic model to help us assess the remaining exploration potential over our nearly two million gross acre position offshore Nicaragua. China  We have been engaged in exploration and development activities in China since 1996 under the terms of a PSC, expiring in 2018. We have a 57% non-operated working interest in the Cheng Dao Xi field, which is located in the shallow water of the southern Bohai Bay.We are currently negotiating for the sale of our China properties and expect the transaction to close during the first half of 2014. As of December 31, 2013, our China properties are included in assets held for sale in our consolidated balance sheet.North Sea During 2013, we sold substantially all of the non-operated working interest properties located in the UK and Netherlands sectors of the North Sea. On a combined basis, the sales resulted in a $65 million gain based on net sales proceeds of $56 million for the fields, and we continue to market our remaining North Sea properties. The North Sea's fourth quarter production was 600 Boe/d. As of December 31, 2013, all the properties remaining in our North Sea geographical segment are included in assets held for sale in our consolidated balance sheet. Our consolidated statements of operations have been reclassified for all periods presented to reflect the operations of our North Sea geographical segment as discontinued.See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Financial Data – Note 3. Property Transactions.Proved Reserves DisclosuresInternal Controls Over Reserves Estimates   Our policies regarding internal controls over the recording of reserves estimates require reserves to be in compliance with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) definitions and guidance and prepared in accordance with Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Engineers. Our internal controls over reserves estimates also include the following:•the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors reviews significant reserves changes on an annual basis;•fields that meet a minimum reserve quantity threshold, newly sanctioned development projects, and certain fields selected on a rotational basis, which combined represent over 80% of our proved reserves, are audited by Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc. (NSAI), a third-party petroleum consulting firm, on an annual basis; and•NSAI is engaged by and has direct access to the Audit Committee. See Third-Party Reserves Audit, below.In addition, our Company-wide short-term incentive plan does not include quantitative targets for proved reserves additions.14Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsResponsibility for compliance in reserves estimation is delegated to our Corporate Reservoir Engineering group. Qualified petroleum engineers in our Houston and Denver offices prepare all reserves estimates for our different geographical regions. These reserves estimates are reviewed and approved by regional management and senior engineering staff with final approval by the Senior Vice President – Corporate Development and certain members of senior management.Our Senior Vice President – Corporate Development oversees our corporate business development, new ventures, strategic planning, environmental analysis and reserves departments. He is the technical person primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of our reserves estimates. He has Bachelor of Science and Master of Science degrees in Petroleum Engineering and over 33 years of industry experience with positions of increasing responsibility in engineering, evaluations, and business unit management at the Company. The Senior Vice President – Corporate Development reports directly to our Chief Executive Officer.Technologies Used in Reserves Estimation The SEC’s reserves rules allow the use of techniques that have been proved effective by actual production from projects in the same reservoir or an analogous reservoir or by other evidence using reliable technology that establishes reasonable certainty. Reliable technology is a grouping of one or more technologies (including computational methods) that has been field tested and has been demonstrated to provide reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability in the formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation.We used a combination of production and pressure performance, wireline wellbore measurements, simulation studies, offset analogies, seismic data and interpretation, wireline formation tests, geophysical logs and core data to calculate our reserves estimates, including the material additions to the 2013 reserves estimates.Third-Party Reserves Audit  In each of the years 2013, 2012, and 2011, we retained NSAI to perform reserves audits of proved reserves. The reserves audit for 2013 included a detailed review of nine of our major onshore US, deepwater Gulf of Mexico and international fields, which covered approximately 74% of US proved reserves and 98% of international proved reserves (85% of total proved reserves). The reserves audit for 2012 included a detailed review of eight of our major fields and covered approximately 93% of total proved reserves. The reserves audit for 2011 included a detailed review of 14 of our major fields and covered approximately 90% of total proved reserves.In connection with the 2013 reserves audit, NSAI prepared its own estimates of our proved reserves. In order to prepare its estimates of proved reserves, NSAI examined our estimates with respect to reserves quantities, future production rates, future net revenue, and the present value of such future net revenue. NSAI also examined our estimates with respect to reserves categorization, using the definitions for proved reserves set forth in Regulation S-X Rule 4-10(a) and subsequent SEC staff interpretations and guidance.In the conduct of the reserves audit, NSAI did not independently verify the accuracy and completeness of information and data furnished by us with respect to ownership interests, oil and gas production, well test data, historical costs of operation and development, product prices, or any agreements relating to current and future operations of the fields and sales of production. However, if in the course of the examination something came to the attention of NSAI which brought into question the validity or sufficiency of any such information or data, NSAI did not rely on such information or data until it had satisfactorily resolved its questions relating thereto or had independently verified such information or data.NSAI determined that our estimates of reserves have been prepared in accordance with the definitions and regulations of the SEC, including the criteria of “reasonable certainty,” as it pertains to expectations about the recoverability of reserves in future years, under existing economic and operating conditions, consistent with the definition in Rule 4-10(a)(24) of Regulation S-X. NSAI issued an unqualified audit opinion on our proved reserves at December 31, 2013, based upon their evaluation. NSAI concluded that our estimates of proved reserves were, in the aggregate, reasonable and have been prepared in accordance with Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Engineers. NSAI’s report is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.The fields audited by NSAI are chosen in accordance with Company guidelines and result in the audit of a minimum of 80% of our total proved reserves. The fields are chosen by the Senior Vice President – Corporate Development and are reviewed by senior management and the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. Our practice is to select fields for audit based on size. This process results in the audit of fields that meet a minimum reserve quantity threshold, newly sanctioned development projects, and certain fields selected on a rotational basis. When compared on a field-by-field basis, some of our estimates are greater and some are less than the estimates of NSAI. Given the inherent uncertainties and judgments that go into estimating proved reserves, differences between internal and external estimates are to be expected. For proved reserves at December 31, 2013, on a quantity basis, the NSAI field estimates ranged from 21 MMBoe or 8% above to 15 MMBoe or 5% below as compared with our estimates on a field-by-field basis. Differences between our estimates and those of NSAI are reviewed for accuracy but are not further analyzed unless the aggregate variance is greater than 10%. Reserves differences at December 31, 2013 were, in the aggregate, approximately 9 MMBoe, or 1%.15Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsProved Undeveloped Reserves (PUDs)  As of December 31, 2013, our PUDs totaled 206 MMBbls of crude oil, condensate and NGLs and 2.1 Tcf of natural gas, for a total of 557 MMBoe.PUDs Locations We have several significant ongoing development projects which are in various stages of completion. PUDs are located as follows at December 31, 2013:•227 MMBoe in the DJ Basin. Based on our current inventory of identified horizontal well locations and our anticipated rate of drilling activity, we expect these PUDs to be converted to proved developed reserves over an approximate three-year period;•177 MMBoe in the Marcellus Shale. Based on our current inventory of identified horizontal well locations and our anticipated rate of drilling activity, we expect these PUDs to be converted to proved developed reserves over an approximate two-year period;•20 MMBoe in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico;•58 MMBoe in the Alba field, offshore Equatorial Guinea, 55 MMBoe of which have been recorded as PUDs for over five years and are attributable to a sanctioned compression project, for which construction has commenced. These volumes, which will be recovered through existing wells, will be reclassified to proved developed at start-up, currently expected in 2016; and •72 MMBoe in Israel primarily in the Tamar and Tamar Southwest fields.The above fields represent 99% of total PUDs. The remaining 1% is associated with ongoing developments in various areas scheduled to be drilled in the next five years. PUDs include no material amounts, except the Alba field PUDs, which have remained undeveloped for five years or more since initial disclosure.Changes in PUDs Changes in PUDs that occurred during the year were due to:  United States EquatorialGuinea Israel China Total(MMBoe)          Proved Undeveloped Reserves Beginning of Year 272 74 375 2 723Revisions of Previous Estimates 41 8 2 (1) 50Extensions, Discoveries and Other Additions 153 3 30 1 187Purchase of Minerals in Place 22 — — — 22Conversion to Proved Developed (63) (27) (335) — (425)Proved Undeveloped Reserves End of Year 425 58 72 2 557United States•positive revisions of 39 MMBoe, primarily due to increased recovery assumptions in the DJ Basin and Marcellus Shale as a result of better than expected performance from existing wells; •positive revisions of 2 MMBoe, primarily in the Marcellus Shale, due to changes in commodity prices;•additions of 81 MMBoe in the DJ Basin horizontal drilling program; •additions of 58 MMBoe in the Marcellus Shale horizontal drilling program;•additions of 14 MMBoe in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico due to recently sanctioned Gunflint and Big Bend projects;•purchases of 22 MMBoe related to acquisitions of additional Marcellus Shale acreage; and•conversion of 63 MMBoe into proved developed reserves attributable to ongoing development in the DJ Basin (19% of year end 2012 PUD volumes converted) and Marcellus Shale (30% of year end 2012 PUD volumes converted).Equatorial Guinea•positive revisions of 8 MMBoe due to performance revisions for the Alba field;•additions of 3 MMBoe attributable to an infill location at the Alba field; and•conversion of 27 MMBoe due to start-up of the Alen field.Israel•positive revisions of 2 MMBoe due to performance revisions for the Tamar field;•additions of 30 MMBoe in the recently discovered and sanctioned Tamar Southwest field; and•conversion of 335 MMBoe due to start-up of the Tamar field.Development Costs Costs incurred to advance the development of PUDs were approximately $1.0 billion in 2013, $1.8 billion in 2012, and $1.4 billion in 2011. A significant portion of costs incurred in 2013 related to the following development projects: horizontal Niobrara; Marcellus Shale; Alen; and Tamar, which were converted to proved developed reserves in 2013.Estimated future development costs relating to the development of PUDs are projected to be approximately $3.2 billion in 2014, $2.1 billion in 2015, and $1.2 billion in 2016. Estimated future development costs include capital spending on major 16Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statementsdevelopment projects, some of which will take several years to complete. PUDs related to major development projects will be reclassified to proved developed reserves when production commences.Drilling Plans All PUD drilling locations are scheduled to be drilled prior to the end of 2018. PUDs associated with our Alba compression project are also expected to be converted to proved developed reserves prior to the end of 2018. Initial production from these PUDs is expected to begin during the years 2014 - 2018.For more information see the following:•Item 7.

Pursuant to the Tilapia PSC, our second exploration period expires on July 6, 2015; however, we have the right to extend our acreage for an additional two years. Pursuant to our YoYo mining concession, development must commence prior to December 2014, and we are actively engaged in negotiations to extend the term of the mining concession to 35 years.Drilling Activity The results of crude oil and natural gas wells drilled and completed for each of the last three years were as follows:   Net Exploratory Wells Net Development Wells    Productive Dry Total Productive Dry Total TotalYear Ended December 31, 2013              United States  5.8 — 5.8 341.7 3.9 345.6 351.4Equatorial Guinea  — — — — — — —China — — — 1.7 — 1.7 1.7Nicaragua — 0.7 0.7 — — — 0.7Total 5.8 0.76.5343.43.9347.3353.8Year Ended December 31, 2012              United States  8.1 2.3 10.4 457.5 — 457.5 467.9Equatorial Guinea  — — — 2.3 — 2.3 2.3Cameroon — 0.5 0.5 — — — 0.5Israel  — — — 3.2 — 3.2 3.2China — — — 1.7 — 1.7 1.7Total 8.1 2.8 10.9 464.7 — 464.7 475.6Year Ended December 31, 2011              United States  9.6 3.7 13.3 641.2 4.0 645.2 658.5Equatorial Guinea  — — — 0.5 — 0.5 0.5Cameroon — 0.5 0.5 — — — 0.5Senegal/Guinea-Bissau — 0.3 0.3 — — — 0.3China — — — 2.9 — 2.9 2.9Total 9.6 4.5 14.1 644.6 4.0 648.6 662.7 20Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsIn addition to the wells drilled and completed in 2013 included in the table above, wells that were in the process of drilling or completing at December 31, 2013 were as follows:   Exploratory (1) Development(2) Total  Gross Net Gross Net Gross NetUnited States  10 5.6 188 106.8 198 112.4Cameroon  1 0.5 — — 1 0.5Cyprus  2 1.4 — — 2 1.4Equatorial Guinea  9 4.2 — — 9 4.2Falkland Islands  1 0.4 — — 1 0.4Israel  8 3.3   8 3.3Total 31 15.4 188 106.8 219 122.2(1) Includes exploratory wells drilled and suspended awaiting a sanctioned development plan or being evaluated to assess the economic viability of the well.

Capitalized Exploratory Well Costs for additional information on suspended exploratory wells. Oil Spill Response Preparedness In the US, we maintain membership in Clean Gulf Associates (CGA), a nonprofit association of production and pipeline companies operating in the Gulf of Mexico. On behalf of its membership, CGA has contracted with Helix Energy Solutions Group (HESG) for the provision of subsea intervention, containment, capture and shut-in capacity for deepwater Gulf of Mexico exploratory wells. The system, known as the Helix Fast Response System (HFRS), at full production capacity, can contain well leaks up to 55 MBbl/d of oil and 95 MMcf/d of natural gas, at 10,000 pounds per square inch (psi) in water depths to 10,000 feet. Resources also include 15,000 psi-gauge and 10,000 psi-gauge intervention capping stacks designed to shut-in wells in water depths to 10,000 feet. We have entered into a separate utilization agreement with HESG which specifies the asset day rates should the HFRS system be deployed.In May 2013, we successfully led a full-scale drill deployment of critical well control equipment to assess our ability to respond to a potential subsea blowout in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. The drill was a collaborative test between the Department of the Interior's Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE), the US Coast Guard, Louisiana Offshore Coordinator's Office and all 15 member companies of the HWCG consortium. Activation of the HFRS rapid response system and deployment of the HWCG capping stack to pressurization requirements met all objectives and marked the successful completion of the exercise.Internationally, we maintain membership in Oil Spill Response Limited (OSRL). OSRL is an industry owned cooperative which exists to ensure effective response to oil spills wherever they occur. OSRL is an industry leader in oil spill preparedness and response services. We also maintain agreements internationally with Seacor Holdings Inc. (Seacor). Seacor provides leased response equipment as well as oil spill response services. Additionally, in Equatorial Guinea, we are members of the Oil and Gas Operators Emergency Resource Allocation Group which shares equipment and resources in the event of a spill.In June 2013, we conducted a Full Scale Oil Spill Response exercise offshore Israel with participation from Israel’s Ministry of Environmental Protection, Ministry of Energy and Water Resources, Ministry of Transportation, and Ministry of Defense. This exercise successfully demonstrated to the Israeli government our ability to deploy and manage resources in an emergency.Domestic Marketing Activities Crude oil, natural gas, condensate and NGLs produced in the US are generally sold under short-term and long-term contracts at market-based prices adjusted for location and quality. Crude oil and condensate are distributed through pipelines and by trucks and rail cars to gatherers, transportation companies and refineries.Certain onshore US areas in which we operate have had minimal infrastructure in place for the processing and transportation of our production. Company and third party infrastructure projects coming online in the near future will improve flow assurance and enhance transportation of produced crude oil and natural gas to end markets.International Marketing Activities Our share of crude oil and condensate from the Aseng and Alen fields is sold to Glencore Energy UK Ltd (Glencore Energy) under a long-term sales contract through May 2015, at market rates, and is transported by tanker. Our share of crude oil and condensate from the Alba field is sold to Glencore Energy under a short-term sales contract, subject to renewal, and is transported by tanker. Natural gas from the Alba field is sold for $0.25 per MMBtu to a methanol plant, an LPG plant and an unaffiliated LNG plant. The sales contract with the methanol plant runs through 2026, and the sales contract with the LNG plant runs through 2023. The methanol and LPG plants are owned by affiliated entities accounted for under the equity method of accounting. 21Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsIn Israel, we sell natural gas from the Tamar and Mari-B fields, and have agreements with multiple customers to sell natural gas under long-term contracts, ranging from 15 to 17 years. See Delivery Commitments, below. Our North Sea crude oil production is transported by tanker and sold on the spot market. In China, we sell crude oil into the local market through pipelines under a long-term contract through the end of the field's production life at market-based prices.Delivery Commitments Some of our natural gas sales contracts specify the delivery of fixed and determinable quantities. Israel Gas Sales and Purchase Agreements (GSPA) We currently sell natural gas from our producing fields offshore Israel to the Israel Electric Corporation (IEC) and numerous other Israeli purchasers, including independent power producers, cogeneration facilities and industrial companies. Most contracts provide for the sale of natural gas over a 15 to 17 year period. Some of the contracts provide for increase or reduction in total quantities, and some contracts are interruptible during certain contract periods. Sales prices may be based on an initial base price subject to price indexation over the life of the contract and with a floor. The IEC contract provides for price reopeners in the eighth and eleventh years with limits on the increase/decrease from the contractual price.Under the contracts, we and our partners have a financial exposure in the event we cannot fully deliver the contract quantities. This exposure is capped by contract and will be reflected as a reduction in sales price for periods in which we are delivering partial contract quantities, or as a direct payment to the customer under certain circumstances and with a cap. The cap is subject to force majeure considerations. We believe that any such sales price adjustments or direct payments would not have a material impact on our earnings or cash flows. As of December 31, 2013, a total of approximately 6.2 Tcf, gross, (2.2 Tcf, net) of natural gas remained to be delivered under the contracts. At December 31, 2013, we have recorded 2.5 Tcf, net, of proved natural gas reserves, including 433 Bcf, net, of PUD reserves, for offshore Israel.Significant Purchasers Glencore Energy was the largest single non-affiliated purchaser of 2013 production and purchased our share of crude oil and condensate production from the Alba, Aseng and Alen fields in Equatorial Guinea. Sales to Glencore Energy accounted for 25% of 2013 total crude oil, natural gas and NGL sales, or 34% of 2013 crude oil sales. Shell Trading (US) Company and Shell International Trading and Shipping Limited (collectively, Shell) purchased crude oil and condensate domestically from the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and the DJ Basin area and internationally from the North Sea. Sales to Shell accounted for 13% of 2013 total crude oil, natural gas and NGL sales, or 17% of crude oil sales. No other single non-affiliated purchaser accounted for 10% or more of crude oil and natural gas sales in 2013. We maintain credit insurance associated with specific purchasers and believe that the loss of any one purchaser would not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations since there are numerous potential purchasers of our production. Hedging Activities Although commodity prices are historically volatile, price changes were relatively mild in 2013. Prices for crude oil and natural gas are affected by a variety of factors beyond our control. We use derivative instruments to reduce the impact of commodity price uncertainty and increase cash flow predictability relating to the marketing of our crude oil and natural gas. As a result of hedging, near-term cash flow volatility is reduced, which allows us to plan our financial commitments and support our capital investment programs. Our practice has been to hedge up to 50% of our forecasted hedgeable crude oil and natural gas production for the current year plus two additional calendar years. The limit was increased to up to a maximum of 75% of forecasted hedgeable global crude oil production for the years 2014 and 2015. We exercise strong management of our hedging program with strong oversight by our Board of Directors. For additional information, see Item 1A. Risk Factors, Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 8. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. Regulations Exploration for, and production and marketing of, crude oil and natural gas are extensively regulated at the federal, state, and local levels in the US, and internationally. Crude oil and natural gas development and production activities are subject to various laws and regulations (and orders of regulatory bodies pursuant thereto) governing a wide variety of matters, including, among others, allowable rates of production, transportation, prevention of waste and pollution, and protection of the environment. Laws affecting the crude oil and natural gas industry are under constant review for amendment or expansion over time and frequently impose more stringent regulatory requirements on oil and gas companies. Our ability to economically produce and sell crude oil and natural gas is affected by a number of legal and regulatory factors, including federal, state and local laws and regulations in the US and laws and regulations of foreign nations. Many of these governmental bodies have issued rules and regulations that require extensive efforts to ensure compliance, that impose incremental costs to comply, and that carry substantial penalties for failure to comply. These laws, regulations and orders may restrict the rate of crude oil and natural gas production below the rate that would otherwise exist in the absence of such laws, regulations and orders. The regulatory requirements on the crude oil and natural gas industry often result in incremental costs of doing business and consequently affect our profitability. See Item 1A. Risk Factors.22Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsInternationally, our operations are subject to legal and regulatory oversight by energy-related ministries or other agencies of our host countries, each having certain relevant energy or hydrocarbons laws. Examples include: •the Ministry of Mines, Industry and Energy which, under such laws as the hydrocarbons law enacted in 2006 by the government of Equatorial Guinea, regulates our exploration, development and production activities offshore Equatorial Guinea;•the Ministry of Energy and Water Resources which regulates our exploration and development activities offshore Israel and the Israeli electricity market into which we sell our natural gas production;•the Israeli Antitrust Commission which reviews Israel's domestic natural gas sales and ownership in offshore blocks and leases; •the Ministry of Energy, Commerce, Industry and Tourism which regulates our exploration and development activities offshore Cyprus;•the Department of Energy and Climate Change which regulates our exploration and development activities in the UK sector of the North Sea;•various agencies in China which, under such laws as the Provisional Regulations on Administration and Management of the Abandonment of Offshore Oil and Gas Producing Facilities enacted in 2010, regulate our development and production activities offshore China;•the Petroleum Directorate which regulates our exploration activities offshore Sierra Leone; and•the Department of Mineral Resources which regulates our exploration activities offshore the Falkland Islands.Examples of other laws affecting our international operations are the Israeli Petroleum Profits Taxation Law, 2011, which imposes additional income tax on oil and gas production, and the UK Finance Bill 2011, which increased the rate of the Supplementary Charge levied on oil and gas income. Under the Israeli Petroleum Profits Taxation Law, 2011, the depletion allowance was abolished, and a levy at an initial rate of 20% was imposed on profits from oil and gas. The levy gradually rises to 50%, depending on the levy coefficient (the R-Factor). The R-Factor refers to the percentage of the amount invested in the exploration, development and establishment of the project, so that the 20% rate is imposed only after a recovery of 150% of the amount invested (R-Factor of 1.5) and scales linearly up to a maximum of 50% after a recovery of 230% of the amount invested (R-Factor of 2.3). The rate of royalties paid to the State of Israel remained unchanged. Also affecting our operations in Israel is the Law for Change in the Tax Burden (Amendments to Legislation), 2011 (the 2011 Tax Act). As from 2012, the 2011 Tax Act eliminated, inter alia, a previously enacted progressive reduction in the corporate tax rate, and increased the corporate tax rate to 25%. The Israeli corporate tax rate was further increased from 25% to 26.5% as a part of the Budget Law 2013-2014, in 2013.Examples of US federal agencies with regulatory authority over our exploration for, and production and sale of, crude oil and natural gas include: •the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) and BSEE, which under laws such as the Federal Land Policy and Management Act, Endangered Species Act, National Environmental Policy Act and Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, have certain authority over our operations on federal lands, particularly in the Rocky Mountains and deepwater Gulf of Mexico;•the Office of Natural Resources Revenue, which under the Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Management Act of 1982 has certain authority over our payment of royalties, rentals, bonuses, fines, penalties, assessments, and other revenue;•the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), which under laws such as the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, as amended, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended, the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, and the Occupational Safety and Health Act have certain authority over environmental, health and safety matters affecting our operations;•the US Fish and Wildlife Service, which under the Endangered Species Act has authority over activities that may result in the take of an endangered species or its habitat;•the US Army Corps of Engineers, which under the Clean Water Act has authority to regulate the construction of structures involving the fill of certain waters and wetlands subject to federal jurisdiction, including well pads, pipelines, and roads;•the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), which under laws such as the Energy Policy Act of 2005 has certain authority over the marketing and transportation of crude oil and natural gas we produce onshore and from the deepwater Gulf of Mexico; and•the Department of Transportation (DOT), which has certain authority over the transportation of products, equipment and personnel necessary to our onshore US and deepwater Gulf of Mexico operations.Other US federal agencies with certain authority over our business include the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the SEC. In addition, we are governed by the rules and regulations of the NYSE, upon which shares of our common stock are traded.23Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsVarious state and federal statutes prohibit certain actions that adversely affect endangered or threatened species and their habitat, wetlands, migratory birds, and natural resources. Where the taking or harm of such species occurs or may occur, or where damages to wetlands or natural resources may occur, the government or private parties may act to prevent oil and natural gas exploration activities. A federal or state agency could order a complete halt to drilling activities in certain locations or during certain seasons when such activities could result in a serious adverse effect upon a protected species. The presence of a protected species in areas where we operate could adversely affect future production from those areas.On May 17, 2010, the BLM issued a revised oil and gas leasing policy that requires, among other things, a more detailed environmental review prior to leasing oil and natural gas rights, increased public engagement in the development of master leasing and development plans prior to leasing areas where intensive new oil and gas development is anticipated, and a comprehensive parcel review process. In 2009, the EPA launched a program that requires many suppliers of hydrocarbon fuels or industrial chemicals, manufacturers of vehicles and engines, and other facilities that emit 25,000 metric tons or more of carbon dioxide equivalent per year to report their annual greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In November 2010, the EPA issued final regulations requiring such annual reporting of GHG emissions from qualifying facilities in the upstream oil and natural gas sector, including onshore production (Subpart W). The first annual reports under Subpart W were due in 2012 for 2011 emissions. Substantially all of our onshore US properties are subject to the Subpart W reporting requirements. Information in such reports could form the basis of future GHG regulations.On August 16, 2012, the EPA issued New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) and National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants to control air emissions associated with crude oil and natural gas production, including natural gas wells that are hydraulically fractured. These regulations require technologies and processes that, while reducing emissions, will enable companies to collect additional natural gas that can be sold. The EPA's final standards also address emissions from storage tanks and other equipment. The final rules establish a phase-in period that is intended to ensure that manufacturers have time to make and broadly distribute the required emissions reduction technology. During the first phase, until January 2015, owners and operators must either flare their emissions or use emissions reduction technology called “green completions,” technologies that are already widely deployed at wells. In 2015, all newly fractured natural gas wells will be required to use green completions. The EPA's final rules are expected to have minimal impact on our business. The reduction of GHG emissions is already one of our priorities and we have been working to improve our methods to reduce GHGs through operational and business practices. We use green completions or flaring on a number of our wells to comply with Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission (COGCC) rules. Additionally we have undertaken emission reduction projects such as our US Vapor Recovery Unit (VRU) program, where we have installed VRUs to capture natural gas that would otherwise be flared on a substantial number of our tank batteries.Most of the states within which we operate have separate agencies with authority to regulate related operational and environmental matters. Colorado Examples of such regulation on the operational side include the Greater Wattenberg Area Special Well Location Rule 318A (Rule 318A), which was adopted by the COGCC to address oil and gas well drilling, production, commingling and spacing in Wattenberg (located in the DJ Basin). On August 9, 2011, the COGCC approved amendments to Rule 318A. The amendments, which became effective on October 1, 2011, remove the limit on the number of wells which can produce from a particular formation, allowing wellbore spacing units and permitting wells to cross section lines. The amendments also address areas such as infill drilling, water sampling and waste management plans. In February 2013, the COGCC approved new setback rules for oil and gas wells and production facilities located in close proximity to occupied buildings. Previously, the COGCC allowed setback distances of 150 feet in rural areas and 350 feet in high density urban areas. These have been increased to a uniform 500 feet statewide setback from occupied buildings and 1,000 feet from high occupancy building units. The new setback rules also require operators to utilize increased mitigation measures to limit potential drilling impacts to surface owners and the owners of occupied building units. In addition, the new rules require advance notice to surface owners, the owners of occupied buildings and local governments prior to the filing of an Application for Permit to Drill or Oil and Gas Location Assessment as well as expanded outreach and communication efforts by an operator. The COGCC also approved two new rules making Colorado the first state to require sampling of groundwater for hydrocarbons and other indicator compounds both before and after drilling. Those new statewide rules require sampling of up to four water wells within a half mile radius of a new oil and gas well before drilling, between six and 12 months after completion, and between five and six years after completion. For the Greater Wattenberg Area, the rule requires operators to sample only one water well per quarter governmental section before drilling and between six to 12 months after completion.On the environmental side, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, under delegation from the EPA, has adopted measures to regulate air emissions, water protection and waste handling and disposal relating to our oil and gas 24Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statementsexploration and production. Moreover, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment has proposed extending the EPA’s air standards for oil and gas operations by directly controlling methane emissions.In November 2013, the state of Colorado proposed rules to regulate detection and reduction of methane emissions associated with oil and gas drilling. The proposed rules, which would cover the life cycle of oil and gas development, production, and maintenance, reflect a collaborative effort by the Environmental Defense Fund, Noble Energy and other oil and gas operators.Pennsylvania On February 14, 2012, Governor Tom Corbett of Pennsylvania signed into law what is known as Act 13 of 2012 (Act 13). Act 13 represents the first comprehensive legislation regarding the development of the Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania. Act 13, among other things, enacted stronger environmental standards and established impact fees, which in 2012 equaled $50,000 for each horizontal Marcellus Shale well. Act 13 also increased the notice distance of unconventional well permit applications from 1,000 feet to 3,000 feet, and extended the setback distance for unconventional wells from 200 feet to 500 feet. The statute also increased the distance and duration of presumed liability for water pollution to 2,500 feet from a well site and twelve months after well drilling, completion, stimulation, or alteration. In addition, Act 13 imposed spill prevention requirements applicable to well site construction, wastewater transportation, and gathering lines. These requirements may result in increased costs and lower rates of return for our Marcellus Shale development project.In March 2012, seven municipalities filed suit against Act 13's statewide zoning provisions, claiming that Act 13 violated the state constitution. On July 26, 2012, the Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court declared the statewide zoning provisions in Act 13 unconstitutional, null, void and unenforceable. The Court also struck down the provision of the law that required the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection to grant waivers to the setback requirements in Pennsylvania's Oil and Gas Act. This decision was appealed to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court and arguments were presented on October 18, 2012. The Supreme Court upheld the lower court's decision, which could make it more difficult to develop our Marcellus Shale acreage in some municipalities within Pennsylvania. NETL Study The US Department of Energy's National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) is conducting a comprehensive assessment of the environmental effects of shale gas production at two industry-provided Marcellus Shale test sites in southwestern Pennsylvania. Goals include: •documentation of environmental changes that are coincident with shale gas production; •development of technology or management practices that mitigate any unintended environmental changes; and•development of monitoring technologies to (1) assess the impact of shale gas production on air quality and (2)determine if zonal isolation between producing formations and drinking water aquifers is maintained after hydraulic fracturing.We will monitor the results of the NETL study in order to assess any potential impact on our onshore US development programs.Other Jurisdictions In December 2011, the West Virginia legislature passed, and the governor signed, the Natural Gas Horizontal Wells Control Act, which, among other things, provides for increased well permit fees, well location restrictions, well site safety, public notice requirements for municipalities, and regulations regarding water use and wastewater handling.Some of the counties and municipalities where we operate have adopted regulations or ordinances that impose additional restrictions on our oil and gas exploration and production. An example is Garfield County, Colorado, which provides local land and road use restrictions affecting our Piceance Basin operations and requires us to post bonds to secure any restoration obligations. Beyond that, in 2012, Longmont, Colorado prohibited the use of hydraulic fracturing. The oil and gas industry is challenging that ban, and the authority of local jurisdictions to regulate oil and gas development, in court. In November 2013, several other Colorado municipalities passed ballot measures supporting restrictions or bans on the practice of hydraulic fracturing within their boundaries. See Hydraulic Fracturing.Update on Israel's Natural Gas Policy In 2011, the Interministerial Committee to Examine Government Policy Regarding the Natural Gas Industry in Israel (the Committee) was charged with the task of proposing a government policy for developing the natural gas economy. Objectives include the following:•ensuring energy security in the economy;•providing a framework for substantial resource exports;•designating a certain percentage of production from each field for domestic natural gas demand;•maintaining competition in the different sectors of the local economy;•maximizing economic and political benefits; and•leveraging environmental advantages with respect to the use of natural gas.The Committee was also asked to examine, among other items, the desired policy to maintain reserves to supply local demand and export of natural gas. In September 2012, the Committee issued its final recommendations. In its report, the Committee stated that permitting export of natural gas does not harm, but rather promotes the needs of domestic users and encourages development of natural gas-based domestic industry. The recommendations included, among others, the following points:25Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements•as a rule, all reservoirs should be charged with supplying a certain percentage of natural gas to the local economy, with minimum requirements based on reservoir size (minimum of 25%-50%). The minimum supply obligations will not apply for reservoirs under a certain size (25 BCM) but the reservoirs will be required to be connected to the domestic market. The recommendations allow for a lease in a developed reservoir to exchange its export quota against an "obligation to supply to the domestic market" which applies to any other leaseholder which submitted a development plan so long as approval therefor is given by the Petroleum Commissioner in the Ministry of Energy and Water Resources and by the Israeli Antitrust Authority;•a determination that the quantity of natural gas that should be guaranteed in favor of the local economy should be 450 BCM and that the quantity should be updated in five years;•the export of natural gas should be permitted as long as the quantity from all reservoirs does not exceed 500 BCM, which amount may be reassessed;•regulatory approval required for export, with export licenses eligible for periods up to 25 years;•there should be an absolute preference for the export of natural gas from a facility in an area under Israeli control, including Israel's exclusive economic zone, although further study of various export means (such as export from a foreign area governed by bilateral agreement) and statutory feasibility is necessary; and•steps should be taken to increase competition in the natural gas market.On June 23, 2013, the Israeli government approved the main recommendations of the Committee with certain amendments, including a limitation on the exports allowed from the Tamar field (50% of uncontracted quantities). However, certain members of the Knesset, the Israeli parliament, demanded that natural gas policy, including exports, be legislated by the Knesset as opposed to a government decision. The legality of the government decision was appealed to the Israeli High Court of Justice (High Court). The High Court rejected the appeal on October 21, 2013.Together with the approval of the Committee recommendations on June 23, 2013, the government has required the Ministry of Finance to submit recommendations on export pricing guidelines. The Ministry of Finance has established a work team, which includes representatives from the Tax Authority, the Budgets Department, and the Department of the Chief Economist. The work team was assigned with the aim of presenting a taxation model that will suit all types of export transactions in accordance with the principles detailed in the government resolution. In accordance with a Ministry of Finance notice, we and our partners have submitted several comprehensive responses to the work team and also conducted several follow-up meetings. The work team is expected to publish its recommendations in early 2014.With our partners, we are continuing to study the official export and natural gas development policies and are monitoring any additional developments to assess the possible impact, positive or negative, of any resulting laws or regulations on our future development activities in Israel. Certain changes in Israel's fiscal and/or regulatory regimes or energy policies occurring as a result of Antitrust Authority rulings or government policy on natural gas development and/or exports could delay or reduce the profitability of our Tamar and/or Leviathan development projects, delay closing of a farm-out agreement which we and our partners are negotiating with Woodside or preclude such an agreement entirely, and/or render future exploration and development projects uneconomic.Additionally, the Israeli Antitrust Commissioner (Commissioner) has been actively engaged to encourage competition in developing Israel's natural gas resources. The Commissioner ruled that all domestic natural gas sales contracts are subject to review and approval of the Antitrust Authority and has intervened regarding the terms used in long term contracts with certain gas customers. In addition, the Commissioner has initiated a hearing process to evaluate a contention that allegedly the original acquisition agreement for the Leviathan acreage is a restrictive arrangement. The Commissioner has publicly expressed concerns regarding ownership concentration in exploration blocks and development projects and its potential impacts on a competitive domestic natural gas market. We continue to engage with the Israeli government on this matter. Antitrust Commissioner decisions and actions could potentially result in a requirement to divest assets, reduce or relinquish revenue interests, and/or implement the marketing of our working interest share of production. We have cooperated with the Antitrust Authority's review and, at this time, cannot predict the outcome. Impact of Dodd-Frank Act Derivatives Regulation  The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act), which was passed by Congress and signed into law in July 2010, provides for federal oversight of the over-the-counter derivatives market and entities that participate in that market. The Dodd-Frank Act mandates that the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) adopt rules and regulations implementing the derivatives market provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act , including requirements that certain transactions be cleared on exchanges and that collateral (commonly referred to as “margin”) be posted for uncleared swaps and other derivatives transactions. Although there is an exception from swap clearing and trade execution requirements for commercial end-users that meet certain conditions (commonly referred to as the “end-user exception”), certain market participants, including most if not all of our counterparties, will be required to clear many of their swap transactions with entities that do not satisfy the end-user exception and will have to transact many of their swaps on swap execution facilities or designated contract markets, rather than over-the-counter on a bilateral basis.26Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsWe have determined that we qualify as a ‘‘non-financial entity’’ for purposes of the end-user exception and satisfy the other requirements of the end-user exception. As a result, our hedging activity will not be subject to mandatory clearing. We do not expect to clear our swaps, and our swap transactions will not be subject to the margin requirements imposed by derivatives clearing organizations. Because the margin regulations for uncleared swaps have not been adopted, it is possible that the CFTC, in conjunction with prudential banking regulators, may mandate that financial counterparties entering into swap transactions with end-users must do so with credit support agreements in place, which could result in negotiated credit thresholds above which an end-user must post collateral. If this should occur, we intend to manage our credit relationships to minimize collateral requirements. These requirements may increase the cost to our counterparties of hedging the swap positions they enter into with us, and thus may increase our cost of entering into hedges, which could reduce the relative effectiveness of our hedges and our profitability. To the extent we incur increased costs or are required to post collateral in periods of rising commodity prices, there could be a corresponding decrease in amounts available for our capital investment program. The changes in the regulation of swaps may also result in certain market participants deciding to curtail or cease their derivatives activities. While many regulations have been promulgated and are already in effect, the rulemaking and implementation process is ongoing, and the ultimate effect of the adopted rules and regulations and any future rules and regulations on our business cannot be determined at this time. Impact of Dodd-Frank Act Section 1504 Section 1504 of the Dodd-Frank Act requires disclosure of certain payments made by resource extraction companies to a foreign government or the U.S. federal government for the commercial development of oil, natural gas or minerals. The Dodd-Frank Act mandates that the SEC promulgate rules to implement this disclosure requirement. On August 22, 2012, the SEC adopted Rule 13q-1 under the Exchange Act, which would have required resource extraction companies, such as us, to publicly file information about the type and total amount of payments made for each project related to the commercial development of oil, natural gas, or minerals, and the type and total amount of payments made to each government. That rule, however, was vacated by the District Court for the District of Columbia on the grounds that (i) the SEC misread the statute to require public filing of the information and (ii) the SEC erred in denying an exemption where foreign law prohibits disclosure of payments. The SEC declined to appeal the court’s decision and, instead, is expected to promulgate a revised rule that is responsive to the court’s holdings. We expect that the new rule proposal will be subject to a process of public notice and comment, which generally takes several months to complete, and will not become effective until after the publication of a final revised rule.Environmental Matters As a developer, owner and operator of crude oil and natural gas properties, we are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign country laws and regulations relating to the discharge of materials into, and the protection of, the environment. We must take into account the cost of complying with environmental regulations in planning, designing, drilling, operating and abandoning wells. In most instances, the regulatory requirements relate to the handling and disposal of drilling and production waste products, water and air pollution control procedures, facility siting and construction, and the remediation of petroleum-product contamination. Under state and federal laws, we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes, including wastes disposed of or released by us, or by prior owners or operators in accordance with current laws, to suspend or cease operations in contaminated areas, or to perform remedial well plugging operations or cleanups to prevent future contamination. The EPA and various state agencies have limited the disposal options for hazardous and non-hazardous wastes and may continue to do so. The owner and operator of a site, and persons that treated, disposed of or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances found at a site, may be liable, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. The EPA, state environmental agencies and, in some cases, third parties are authorized to take actions in response to threats to human health or the environment and to seek to recover from responsible classes of persons the costs of such action. Furthermore, certain wastes generated by our crude oil and natural gas operations that are currently exempt from treatment as hazardous wastes may in the future be designated as hazardous wastes and, therefore, be subject to considerably more rigorous and costly operating and disposal requirements. See Item 1A. Risk Factors.Federal and state occupational safety and health laws require us to organize information about hazardous materials used, released or produced in our operations. Certain portions of this information must be provided to employees, state and local governmental authorities and local citizens. We are also subject to the requirements and reporting set forth in federal workplace standards. Certain state or local laws or regulations and common law may impose liabilities in addition to, or restrictions more stringent than, those described herein.We have made and will continue to make expenditures necessary to comply with environmental requirements. We do not believe that we have, to date, expended material amounts in connection with such activities or that compliance with such requirements will have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. Although such requirements do have a substantial impact on the crude oil and natural gas industry, they do not appear to affect us to any greater or lesser extent than other companies in the industry. 27Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsHydraulic Fracturing Concerns The practice of hydraulic fracturing, especially the hydraulic fracturing processes associated with drilling in shale formations, is the subject of significant focus among some environmentalists and regulators. Concerns over potential hazards associated with the use of hydraulic fracturing and its impact on the environment and, potentially, the general public health, have been raised at all levels including US federal, state and local, as well as internationally. Hydraulic fracturing requires the use and disposal of water, and public concern has been growing over its possible effects on drinking water supplies, as well as the adequacy of supply. Our Operations Hydraulic fracturing techniques have been used by the industry since 1947, and, currently, more than 90% of all oil and natural gas wells drilled in the US employ hydraulic fracturing. We strive to adopt best practices and industry standards and comply with all regulatory requirements regarding well construction and operation. For example, the qualified service companies we use to perform hydraulic fracturing, as well as our personnel, monitor rate and pressure to assure that the services are performed as planned. Our well construction practices include installation of multiple layers of protective steel casing surrounded by cement that are specifically designed and installed to protect freshwater aquifers by preventing the migration of fracturing fluids into aquifers. We strive to procure non-hydrologic water (water that is not connected to a natural surface stream); a large proportion of our water is from non-tributary sources, such as deep ground water. In the DJ Basin, we are in the process of securing additional water rights in support of our drilling program, and we engage in recycling efforts in both the DJ Basin and Marcellus Shale. We believe that these processes help ensure hydraulic fracturing is safe and does not and will not pose a risk to water supplies, the environment or general public health. Potential Rulemaking  Although hydraulic fracturing is regulated primarily at the state level, governments and agencies at all levels from federal to municipal are conducting studies and considering regulations. For example, in 2011, the US Secretary of Energy formed the Shale Gas Production Subcommittee (Subcommittee), a subcommittee of the Secretary of Energy Advisory Board. The Subcommittee issued final recommendations in November 2011 that included better communications with the public, better air quality controls, protection of water supply and quality, disclosure of fracturing fluid composition, reduction of diesel fuel use, continuous development of best practices, and federal sponsorship of research and development with respect to unconventional gas. In 2012, the US BLM proposed regulations governing hydraulic fracturing on federal lands, which were withdrawn and then reissued in 2013. Also during 2012, the EPA proposed new guidelines under the Safe Drinking Water Act regarding the issuance of permits for the use of diesel fuel as a component in hydraulic fracturing activities. The guidance outlines for EPA permit writers, where EPA is the permitting authority, requirements for diesel fuels used for hydraulic fracturing of wells, technical recommendations for permitting those wells, and a description of diesel fuels for EPA underground injection control permitting.The EPA is also currently studying the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources. Results are expected to be released in a draft for public and peer review in 2014.In June 2012, OSHA and the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) issued a joint hazard alert for workers who use silica (sand) in hydraulic fracturing activities. OSHA is working with industry and other government agencies to review existing regulations for applicability to hydraulic fracturing. In 2012, several communities in Colorado became interested in increasing regulatory requirements on oil and gas development. The most notable situation occurred in the City of Longmont, Colorado where voters chose to ban hydraulic fracturing activities within city limits. Subsequently, the State of Colorado, through the COGCC, sued the City of Longmont in Boulder County District Court to set aside a city ordinance that promulgated stricter oil and gas rules than the COGCC Rules asserting that portions of these rules are preempted by State statutes and COGCC rules. The Colorado Oil and Gas Association (COGA) moved to intervene in this action and intervention was granted. The case is expected to go to trial in 2014. In the Colorado 2013 general election, the municipalities of Boulder, Broomfield, Fort Collins and Lafayette each passed ballot measures supporting restrictions or bans on the practice of hydraulic fracturing within their boundaries. The Broomfield election results are under review by State officials for potential voting irregularities. For other communities, the specific prohibitions and moratoria were effective upon passage. The large majority of our DJ Basin acreage is not located in these municipalities and, therefore, we do not expect our operations to be impacted by these developments. However, in the future, should additional Colorado ballot initiatives be undertaken to regulate, limit or ban hydraulic fracturing or other facets of oil and gas exploration, development or operations, our business could be impacted resulting in delay or inability to develop oil and gas reserves, reducing our long-term reserves, production and cash flow growth, and have a potential negative impact on our stock price.28Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsOn May 16, 2013, the US Department of the Interior issued proposed rules governing hydraulic fracturing on federal lands. The proposed rules would affect drilling operations on the 700 million acres of federally-owned minerals administered by the BLM, as well as 56 million acres of Native American-owned minerals. The proposed rules would require companies to:•disclose chemicals they inject by using an online database, with an exception for chemicals deemed to be trade secrets; •verify that wells are drilled properly so that toxic fluids do not contaminate groundwater; and •submit plans for managing drilling wastewater in lined pits or storage tanks.The proposed rules could see further revision. Because oil and gas drilling and development activities, including hydraulic fracturing practices, are already regulated at the state level, compliance with federal hydraulic fracturing regulations may result in additional costs and reporting burdens. In Nevada, the State Assembly recently adopted legislation that requires the development of a program to regulate the use of hydraulic fracturing in Nevada. State regulators are in the process of proposing rules and holding public hearings. We continue to monitor new and proposed legislation and regulations to assess the potential impact on our operations. We are currently evaluating the possible impact any proposed rules, such as those described above, could have on our business. Any additional federal, state or local restrictions on hydraulic fracturing that may be imposed in areas in which we conduct business could result in substantial incremental operating, capital and compliance costs as well as delay our ability to develop oil and gas reserves.Public Disclosure Several states have issued regulations requiring disclosure of certain information regarding the components used in the hydraulic-fracturing process. In 2011, the Texas Railroad Commission (RRC) adopted the Hydraulic Fracturing Chemical Disclosure rule, which requires companies to disclose, on a public registry, chemical ingredients used to hydraulically fracture wells. The registry, FracFocus.org, is operated jointly by the Interstate Oil & Gas Compact Commission and the Ground Water Protection Council. In December 2011, the COGCC adopted hydraulic fracturing fluid ingredient regulations requiring disclosure of all chemicals and establishing ways to protect proprietary information. The regulations allow disclosure through the FracFocus web site. The State of Wyoming also requires disclosure of the types and amounts of chemicals. In 2012, through legislation known as Act 13, Pennsylvania established a requirement that operators submit information regarding hydraulic fracturing chemicals to FracFocus.org. Other states have proposed, or are considering, similar regulations which require specific disclosures by operators and/or outline requirements for construction and operation of wells and monitoring of well activity. We are currently providing disclosure information on FracFocus.org for all onshore US areas in which we operate. Additional Information See: •Items 1. and 2. Business and Properties – Regulations;•Item 1A. Risk Factors; and•Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources – Risk and Insurance Program.Undeveloped Oil and Gas Leases   Oil and gas exploration is a lengthy process of obtaining data, evaluating, and de-risking prospects, and it takes time to develop resources in a responsible manner. The period of time from lease acquisition to discovery can take many years of ongoing effort. We begin by leasing acreage (or deepwater lease blocks) from individuals, other operators or the host government. It may take years for us to assemble sufficient acreage to cover the areal extent of a prospect that we wish to explore. Once the acreage position is assembled, we obtain seismic data either through purchase of available data or by contracting for seismic services. Our exploration staff then begin a lengthy process of analyzing the seismic and other data in order to identify a potential optimal location for drilling an initial exploratory well. Once we decide to drill an exploratory well, we must obtain permits and contract a drilling rig with the specifications for the depth and well pressures which we expect to drill. For example, in 2009 we began acquiring our 370,000 fairly contiguous acreage position in northeast Nevada. It took over two years to assemble adequate acreage to warrant data collection. Once the acreage position had been established, we conducted extensive 3D seismic surveys and obtained other data, which our exploration staff analyzed and used to plan an initial drilling program. During 2013, we initiated an exploratory vertical well pilot program. Drilling locations were driven by analysis of the 3D seismic surveys. We must integrate data, such as core samples and well logs obtained from the drilling process, with our seismic and other data to determine if we have discovered hydrocarbons. In northeast Nevada, we expect to see results of our pilot well program by late 2014. If there is a discovery, we may need to obtain additional data and/or drill appraisal wells in order to estimate the extent of the reservoir and the volume of resources that could potentially be recovered. Appraisal or development drilling requires additional 29Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statementstime to contract for an appropriate drilling rig, and obtain pipe, other equipment, and supplies. Due to the current strong onshore and offshore drilling activity, drilling rigs and hydraulic fracturing crews are in high demand, and there could be delays as we wait for rigs or crews to become available.We strive to maintain an appropriate inventory of onshore and offshore exploration prospects suitable to our experience as an operator, financial resources, and current development timeline. Competition The crude oil and natural gas industry is highly competitive. We encounter competition from other crude oil and natural gas companies in all areas of operations, including the acquisition of seismic data and lease rights on crude oil and natural gas properties and for the labor and equipment required for exploration and development of those properties. Our competitors include major integrated crude oil and natural gas companies, state-controlled national oil companies, independent crude oil and natural gas companies, service companies engaging in exploration and production activities, drilling partnership programs, private equity, and individuals. Many of our competitors are large, well-established companies. Such companies may be able to pay more for seismic information and lease rights on crude oil and natural gas properties and exploratory prospects and to define, evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit. Our ability to acquire additional properties and to discover reserves in the future will be dependent upon our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment. See Item 1A. Risk Factors. Geographical DataWe have operations throughout the world and manage our operations by region. Information is grouped into four components that are all primarily in the business of crude oil, natural gas and NGL exploration, development and production: United States, West Africa, Eastern Mediterranean, and Other International and Corporate. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 15. Segment Information. Employees Our total number of employees increased 15%, from 2,190 at December 31, 2012 to 2,527 at December 31, 2013, in support of our major development and exploration projects. The 2013 year-end employee count includes 248 foreign nationals working as employees in Israel, Cyprus, Equatorial Guinea, Cameroon, Nicaragua, and the UK. We regularly use independent contractors and consultants to perform various field and other services. Offices Our principal corporate office is located at 1001 Noble Energy Way, Houston Texas, 77070. We maintain additional offices in Houston, Texas; Ardmore, Oklahoma; Denver, Colorado; Greeley, Colorado; Canonsburg, Pennsylvania; Washington, D. C.; and in China, Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea, Israel, Cyprus, Nicaragua, Falkland Islands, the UK and the Netherlands. Title to Properties We believe that our title to the various interests set forth above is satisfactory and consistent with generally accepted industry standards, subject to exceptions that would not materially detract from the value of the interests or materially interfere with their use in our operations. Individual properties may be subject to burdens such as royalty, overriding royalty and other outstanding interests customary in the industry. In addition, interests may be subject to obligations or duties under applicable laws or burdens such as production payments, net profits interest, liens incident to operating agreements and for current taxes, development obligations under crude oil and natural gas leases or capital commitments under PSCs or exploration licenses.Title Defects Subsequent to a lease or fee interest acquisition, such as our Marcellus Shale acquisition in 2011, the buyer usually has a period of time in which to examine the leases for title defects. Adjustments for title defects are generally made within the terms of the sales agreement, which may provide for arbitration between the buyer and seller. Curative efforts for remaining uncured defects related to the Marcellus Shale acreage are ongoing. Options to address uncured title defects include a reduction in the remaining amount of the CONSOL Carried Cost Obligation, an indemnity agreement, or the transfer of additional interests.Conflicts with Surface Rights Mineral rights are property rights that include the right to use land surface that is reasonably necessary to access minerals beneath. Lawsuits regarding conflicts between surface rights and mineral rights are currently pending in several states. In several cases, owners of surface rights are suing to prevent companies from using their land surface to drill horizontal wells to explore for or produce natural gas from neighboring mineral tracts. If a plaintiff were to prevail in such a case, it could become more difficult and expensive for a company to place multi-acre well pads and/or limit the length of horizontal wells drilled from a pad.30Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsRisk ManagementThe oil and gas business is subject to many significant risks, including operational, strategic, financial and compliance/regulatory risks. We strive to maintain a proactive enterprise risk management (ERM) process to plan, organize, and control our activities in a manner which is intended to minimize the effects of risk on our capital, cash flows and earnings. ERM expands our process to include risks associated with accidental losses, as well as financial, strategic, operational, regulatory, political, and other risks.Our ERM process is designed to operate in an annual cycle, integrated with our long range plans, and supportive of our capital structure planning. Elements include, among others, cash flow at risk analysis, credit risk management, a commodity hedging program to reduce the impacts of commodity price volatility, an insurance program to protect against disruptions in our cash flows, a robust global compliance program, and government and community relations initiatives. We benchmark our program against our peers and other global organizations. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for a discussion of specific risks we face in our business.Available InformationOur website address is www.nobleenergyinc.com.

Copies of the Code of Conduct, and the Code of Ethics for Chief Executive and Senior Financial Officers (the Codes) are posted on our website under the “Corporate Governance” section. Within the time period required by the SEC and the NYSE, as applicable, we will post on our website any modifications to the Codes and any waivers applicable to senior officers as defined in the applicable Code, as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.Item 1A. Risk FactorsDescribed below are certain risks that we believe are applicable to our business and the oil and gas industry in which we operate. There may be additional risks that are not presently material or known. You should carefully consider each of the following risks and all other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If any of the events described below occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity or access to the capital markets could be materially adversely affected. In addition, the current global economic and political environment intensifies many of these risks. Crude oil, natural gas, and NGL prices are volatile and a reduction in these prices could adversely affect our results of operations, our liquidity, and the price of our common stock.Our revenues, operating results and future rate of growth depend highly upon the prices we receive for our crude oil, natural gas, and NGL production. Historically, the markets for crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs have been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile in the future. For example, high and low daily average settlement prices for prompt month contracts for crude oil and natural gas during 2013 were as follows:  Daily Average Settlement Price for Prompt Month Contracts  High LowYear Ended December 31, 2013    NYMEX     Crude Oil - WTI (Per Bbl) $110.53 $86.68 Natural Gas - HH (Per MMBtu) 4.46 3.11Brent     Crude Oil (Per Bbl) 118.90 97.69Prices for our US NGL production are determined at two primary market centers, Conway and Mt. Belvieu. For the year ended December 31, 2013, US average realized NGL prices were approximately 35% of average realized crude oil prices and tended to track the volatility of NYMEX WTI.31Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsThe application of new drilling technologies in the US has unlocked significant crude oil resources in shale formations, resulting in increased domestic supply. This has resulted in US crude oil prices becoming disconnected from global crude oil price indices such as Brent. Current crude oil forward price curves indicate market expectations are that US oil is likely to continue trading at a discount to global prices. In addition, changes may occur in regional US crude oil and natural gas markets with the markets moving from being undersupplied (premium prices) to being oversupplied (discounted prices). Regional US supply/demand changes could significantly impact netback charges and, ultimately, project economics. Finally, a current federal export ban on crude oil and/or governmental regulations regarding LNG exports could limit pricing as domestic supply increases.Markets and prices for crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs depend on factors beyond our control, factors including, among others:•economic factors impacting global gross domestic product growth rates; •global demand for crude oil, natural gas and NGLs;•global factors impacting supply quantities of crude oil, natural gas and NGLs, in particular, US crude oil and NGL supply growth resulting from shale oil development;•Organization of Petroleum-Exporting Countries (OPEC) spare capacity relative to global crude oil supply;•further application of horizontal drilling techniques which could increase production and significantly impact both domestic and global supplies of crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs;•ability to develop natural gas in shale or crude oil in tight formations relatively inexpensively which could increase the supply of natural gas or crude oil;•developments in the global LNG market, including potential exports from the US;•actions taken by foreign hydrocarbon-producing nations;•political conditions and events (including instability or armed conflict) in hydrocarbon-producing regions;•the existence of government imposed price and/or product subsidies;•the price and availability of alternative fuels, including coal, solar, wind, nuclear energy and biofuels;•the long-term impact on the crude oil market of the use of natural gas as an alternative fuel for road transportation;•the availability of pipeline capacity and infrastructure;•the availability of crude oil transportation and refining capacity;•weather conditions;•demand for electricity as well as natural gas used as fuel for electricity generation; •fuel efficiency regulations, such as the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards, and its impacts on crude oil demand as a transportation fuel;•access to government-owned and other lands for exploration and production activities; and•domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes.Declines in commodity prices or inadequate transportation and storage of our product may have the following effects on our business:•reduction of our revenues, operating income and cash flows;•curtailment or shut-in of our production due to lack of transportation or storage capacity;•reduction in the amount of crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs that we can produce economically;•certain properties in our portfolio may become economically unviable;•delay or postponement of some of our capital projects;•significant reductions in our capital investment programs, resulting in a reduced ability to develop our reserves;•limitations on our financial condition, liquidity, and/or ability to finance planned capital expenditures and operations;•limitations on our access to sources of capital, such as equity and debt; and•declines in our stock price.In addition, lower commodity prices, including declines in the commodity forward price curves, may result in the following:•asset impairment charges resulting from reductions in the carrying values of our crude oil and natural gas properties at the date of assessment; •additional counterparty credit risk exposure on commodity hedges; or •reduction in the carrying value of goodwill.Failure to effectively execute our major development projects could result in significant delays and/or cost over-runs, damage to our reputation, and limit our growth with negative impact on our operating results, liquidity and financial position.We currently have an extensive inventory of major development projects in various stages of development. We have expanded our horizontal drilling programs in the DJ Basin and Marcellus Shale and recently sanctioned deepwater development projects at Gunflint and Big Bend. Our Leviathan, Cyprus, Carla and Diega discoveries are being appraised and, as such, not yet sanctioned. It will take several years before first production is achieved. 32Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsSome projects, such as crude oil and natural gas projects offshore West Africa and the Eastern Mediterranean, entail significant technical and other complexities including subsea tiebacks to an FPSO or production platform, pressure maintenance systems, gas re-injection systems, onshore receiving terminals, or other specialized infrastructure. Our Leviathan project also includes potential LNG or floating LNG infrastructure. Additionally, we have multiple unsanctioned integrated development plans for our onshore US acreage. This level of development activity requires significant effort from our management and technical personnel and places additional requirements on our financial resources and internal financial controls. In addition, we depend on third-party technology and service providers and other supply chain participants for these complex projects. We may not be able to fully execute these projects due to:•inability to attract and/or retain a sufficient quantity of personnel with the skills required to bring these complex projects to production on schedule and on budget;•significant delays in delivery of essential items or performance of services, cost overruns, supplier insolvency, or other critical supply failure which could adversely affect project development;•lack of government approval for projects;•civil disturbances, anti-development activities, legal challenges or other potential interruptions which could prevent access; and•drilling hazards or accidents or natural disasters. We may not be able to compensate for, or fully mitigate, these risks.Our international operations may be adversely affected by economic and political developments.We have significant international operations, with approximately 42% of our 2013 total consolidated sales volumes coming from international areas. We are also conducting exploration activities in these and other international areas. Our operations may be adversely affected by political and economic developments, including the following:•renegotiation, modification or nullification of existing contracts, such as may occur pursuant to future regulations enacted as a result of changes in Israel's export and natural gas development policies, or the hydrocarbons law enacted in 2006 by the government of Equatorial Guinea, which can result in an increase in the amount of revenues that the host government receives from production (government take) or otherwise decrease project profitability;•loss of revenue, property and equipment as a result of actions taken by host nations, such as expropriation or nationalization of assets or termination of contracts; •disruptions caused by territorial or boundary disputes in certain international regions; •changes in drilling or safety regulations in other countries as a result of the Deepwater Horizon Incident, a large oil spill occurring in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010, or other incidents that have occurred;•laws and policies of the US and foreign jurisdictions affecting foreign investment, taxation, trade and business conduct;•foreign exchange restrictions;•international monetary fluctuations and changes in the relative value of the US dollar as compared with the currencies of other countries in which we conduct business; and•other hazards arising out of foreign governmental sovereignty over areas in which we conduct operations.Certain of these risks could be intensified by large crude oil or natural gas discoveries in areas where we are currently conducting offshore exploration activities, such as Cyprus, the Falkland Islands, or Nicaragua. Large discoveries, such as ours in the Levant Basin, may have impacts on global natural gas supplies.Such political and economic developments as mentioned above could have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows and reduce the fair values of our properties, resulting in impairment charges. Our operations may be adversely affected by changes in the fiscal regimes and related government policies and regulations in the countries in which we operate.Fiscal regimes impact oil and gas companies through laws and regulations governing resource access along with government participation in oil and gas projects, royalties and taxes. We operate in the US and other countries whose fiscal regimes may change over time. Changes in fiscal regimes result in an increase or decrease in the amount of government financial take from developments, and a corresponding decrease or increase in the revenues of an oil and gas company operating in that particular country. For example, a significant portion of our production comes from Israel and Equatorial Guinea; therefore, changes in the fiscal regimes of these countries could have a significant impact on our operations and financial performance. Further, we cannot predict how government agencies or courts will interpret existing regulations and tax laws or the effect such interpretations could have on our business.33Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsCurrently, many governments globally are seeking additional revenue sources, including, potentially, increases in government financial take from oil and gas projects. In developing nations, additional revenues may be sought to support infrastructure and economic development and for social spending. In many OECD (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development) nations, governments are facing significant budget deficits and growing national debt levels, as well as pressure from financial markets to address structural spending imbalances. In the US, certain measures have been proposed that would alter current tax expense on oil and gas companies, for example: the repeal of percentage depletion for oil and natural gas properties; the deferral of expensing intangible drilling and development costs (IDC); the inability to expense costs of certain domestic production activities; and a lengthening of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures. It is likely that some of these proposals to increase tax expense on the oil and gas industry will continue to be reviewed by the US Congress in 2014 or future years. The enactment of some or all of these proposals would have a significant negative impact on our capital investment, production and growth. In particular, we estimate that the elimination of the deductibility of IDC expenditures would impact our cash available for investment and could curtail our domestic capital spending program up to 20%.Changes in fiscal regimes have long-term impacts on our business strategy, and fiscal uncertainty makes it difficult to formulate and execute capital investment programs. The implementation of new, or the modification of existing, laws or regulations increasing the tax costs on our business could disrupt our business plans and negatively impact our operations in the following ways, among others: •restrict resource access or investment in lease holding;•reduce exploration activities, which could have a long-term negative impact on the quantities of proved reserves we record and inhibit future production growth; •have a negative impact on the ability of us and/or our partners to obtain financing;•cause delay in or cancellation of development plans, which could also have a long-term negative impact on the quantities of proved reserves we record and inhibit future production growth;•reduce the profitability of our projects, resulting in decreases in net income and cash flows with the potential to make future investments uneconomical;•result in currently producing projects becoming uneconomic, to the extent fiscal changes are retroactive, thereby reducing the amount of proved reserves we record and cash flows we receive, and possibly resulting in asset impairment charges;•require that valuation allowances be established against deferred tax assets, with offsetting increases in income tax expense, resulting in decreases in net income and cash flow;•restrict our ability to compete with imported volumes of crude oil or natural gas; and/or•adversely affect the price of our common stock.Our operations may be adversely affected by violent acts such as from civil disturbances, terrorist acts, regime changes, cross-border violence, war, piracy, or other conflicts that may occur in regions that encompass our operations.Violent acts resulting in loss of life, destruction of property, environmental damage and pollution occur around the world. Many incidents are driven by civil, ethnic, religious or economic strife. In addition, the number of incidents attributed to various terrorist organizations has increased significantly. We operate in regions of the world that have experienced such incidents or are in close proximity to areas where violence has occurred.We monitor the economic and political environments of the countries in which we operate. However, we are unable to predict the occurrence of disturbances such as those noted above. In addition, we have limited ability to mitigate their impact. Civil disturbances, terrorist acts, regime changes, war, or conflicts, or the threats thereof, could have the following results, among others: •volatility in global crude oil prices which could negatively impact the global economy, resulting in slower economic growth rates, which could reduce demand for our products;•negative impact on the world crude oil supply if infrastructure or transportation are disrupted, leading to further commodity price volatility; •difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified personnel to work in areas with potential for conflict;•inability of our personnel or supplies to enter or exit the countries where we are conducting operations;•disruption of our operations due to evacuation of personnel;•inability to deliver our production due to disruption or closing of transportation routes;•reduced ability to export our production due to efforts of countries to conserve domestic resources;•damage to or destruction of our wells, production facilities, receiving terminals or other operating assets;•damage to or destruction of property belonging to our natural gas purchasers leading to interruption of gas deliveries, claims of force majeure, and/or termination of natural gas sales contracts, resulting in a reduction in our revenues;34Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements•inability of our service and equipment providers to deliver items necessary for us to conduct our operations resulting in a halt or delay in our planned exploration activities, delayed development of major projects, or shut-in of producing fields;•lack of availability of drilling rig, oilfield equipment or services if third party providers decide to exit the region;•shutdown of a financial system, communications network, or power grid causing a disruption to our business activities; and•capital market reassessment of risk and reduction of available capital making it more difficult for us and our partners to obtain financing for potential development projects.Loss of property and/or interruption of our business plans resulting from civil unrest could have a significant negative impact on our earnings and cash flow. In addition, we may not have enough insurance to cover any loss of property or other claims resulting from these risks. Concentration of our operations in a few core areas may increase our risk of production loss. Our operations are concentrated in five core areas: the DJ Basin, the Marcellus Shale, and the deepwater Gulf of Mexico in the US, offshore West Africa, and the Eastern Mediterranean. These core areas provide approximately 95% of our current production, and account for approximately 90% of our 2014 capital investment program and most of our exploration potential. In addition, a large portion of our production is from a relatively few deepwater wells. For example, approximately 40% of our 2013 production came from four offshore developments. Although, individually, none of the core areas represented more than 35% of our 2013 total sales volumes, disruption of our business in one of these areas, such as from an accident, natural disaster, government intervention, or other event, would result in a significant impact on our production profile, cash flows and overall business plan. We do not maintain business interruption (loss of production) insurance for all of our assets. Loss of production or limitations on our access to reserves in one of our core operating areas could have a significant negative impact on our cash flows and profitability.Exploration, development and production activities as well as natural disasters or adverse weather conditions could result in liability exposure or the loss of production and revenues.Our operations are subject to hazards and risks inherent in the drilling, production and transportation of crude oil and natural gas, including:•injuries and/or deaths of employees, supplier personnel, or other individuals;•pipeline ruptures and spills;•fires, explosions, blowouts and well cratering;•equipment malfunctions and/or mechanical failure on high-volume, high-impact wells;•leaks or spills occurring during the transfer of hydrocarbons from an FPSO to an oil tanker;•loss of product occurring as a result of transfer to a rail car or train derailments;•formations with abnormal pressures and basin subsidence;•release of pollutants;•surface spillage of, or contamination of groundwater by, fluids used in operations;•security breaches, cyber attacks, piracy, or terroristic acts;•theft or vandalism of oilfield equipment and supplies, especially in areas of active onshore operations;•hurricanes, cyclones, windstorms, or “superstorms” which could affect our operations in areas such as the Gulf Coast, deepwater Gulf of Mexico, Marcellus Shale, Eastern Mediterranean or offshore China; •winter storms and snow which could affect our operations in the DJ Basin and Marcellus Shale;•extremely high temperatures, which could affect third party gathering and processing facilities in the DJ Basin;•volcanoes which could affect our operations offshore Equatorial Guinea;•flooding which could affect our operations in low-lying areas; •harsh weather and rough seas offshore the Falkland Islands, which could limit certain exploration activities; and•other natural disasters.Any of these can result in loss of hydrocarbons, environmental pollution and other damage to our properties or the properties of others.35Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsOffshore development involves significant operational and financial risks. We have ongoing major development projects in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, offshore West Africa and offshore Eastern Mediterranean. In addition, we are conducting offshore exploration activities in these and other international locations. In certain areas or at certain times, there may be limited availability of suitable drilling rigs, drilling equipment, support vessels, and qualified operating personnel. Deepwater drilling rigs are typically subject to long-term contracts. In addition, frontier areas may lack the physical and oilfield service infrastructure necessary for production and transportation. As a result, development of an offshore discovery may be a lengthy process and require substantial capital investment. Difficulty and delays in consistently obtaining drilling rigs and other equipment and services at acceptable rates may lead to project delay, increased costs, inability to meet delivery requirements, and/or inability to deliver forecasted production, which could prevent the realization of our targeted return on capital or lead to unexpected future losses.In the event of a well control incident, containment and, potentially, cleanup activities are costly. Additionally, the resulting regulatory costs or penalties, and the results of third party lawsuits, as well as associated legal and support expenses, including costs to address negative publicity, could well exceed the actual costs of containment and cleanup. As a result, a well control incident could result in substantial liabilities for us, and have a significant negative impact on our earnings, cash flows, liquidity, financial position, and stock price.Development drilling may not result in commercially productive quantities of oil and gas reserves.Our exploration success has provided us with a number of major development projects which we are progressing to production. We depend on these projects to provide long life, sustained cash flows after investment and attractive financial returns. However, development drilling is not always successful and the profitability of development projects may change over time.For example, in new development areas available data may not allow us to completely know the extent of the reservoir or choose the best locations for drilling development wells. Therefore, a development well we drill may be a dry hole or result in noncommercial quantities of hydrocarbons. Projects in frontier areas may require the development of technology for development drilling or well completion. Our efforts may result in a dry hole or a well that finds noncommercial quantities of hydrocarbons. Development drilling has many of the same risks as exploratory drilling, which can result in the drilling of a development dry hole or the incurrence of substantial development costs without a corresponding increase in proved reserves.All costs of development drilling and other development activities are capitalized, even if the activities do not result in commercially productive quantities of oil and gas reserves. This puts a property at higher risk for future impairment if commodity prices decrease or future operating or development costs increase.Even if development drilling is successful and we find commercial quantities of reserves, we may encounter difficulties or delays in completing development wells. For example, frontier areas may not have adequate infrastructure for gathering, processing or transportation, and production may be delayed until they are constructed. This results in a decrease in current cash flows and reduces the return on our investment.Costs of drilling, completing and operating wells are often uncertain, and cost factors can adversely affect the economic viability of a project. Even a development project that is currently economically viable can become uneconomic in the future if commodity prices decrease or operating or development costs increase, resulting in impairment charges and a negative impact on our results of operations.The magnitude of our offshore Eastern Mediterranean discoveries will present financial and technical challenges for us and our partners due to the large-scale development requirements.We are currently evaluating potential development scenarios for Leviathan and Cyprus Block 12. Due to the scale of these discoveries, realization of their full economic value depends on the ability to export via pipeline or LNG. Each of these development options would require a multi-billion dollar investment and a number of years to complete.As a result, we have been seeking partners to provide technical and financial support as well as midstream and downstream expertise. We and our existing partners in the Leviathan project are working on an agreement to sell a portion of our working interests in the Leviathan licenses to Woodside Energy Ltd. (Woodside). The transaction is subject to the negotiations and execution of definitive agreements among the parties, as well as customary government approvals, prior to closing. Failure to reach a definitive agreement with Woodside could result in a delay in the Leviathan development project.We continue to study the official export and natural gas development policies in Israel and are monitoring any additional developments to assess the possible impact, positive or negative, of any resulting laws or regulations on our future development activities. Certain changes in Israel's fiscal, and/or regulatory regimes or energy policies occurring as a result of Antitrust Authority rulings or government policy on natural gas development and/or exports could: delay or reduce the profitability of our Tamar and/or Leviathan development projects; delay closing of a farm-out agreement which we and our partners are negotiating with Woodside or preclude such an agreement entirely; and/or render future exploration and development projects uneconomic.36Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsRestrictions on resource access or controls over natural gas pricing could have a negative impact on our business including reduction on future growth rates, profitability and cash flows.Failure to execute successful development scenarios for Leviathan and Cyprus Block 12 could reduce our future growth and have negative effects on our operating results.Failure of our partners to fund their share of development costs or obtain project financing could result in delay or cancellation of future projects, thus limiting our growth and future cash flows.Some of our major development projects entail significant capital expenditures and have long development cycle times. For example, our joint venture arrangement with CONSOL provides for the long-term development of our Marcellus Shale acreage. In the Eastern Mediterranean, each of our natural gas development options would require a multi-billion dollar investment and span multiple years from project sanction to production.As a result, our partners must be able to fund their share of investment costs through the development cycle, through cash flow from operations, external credit facilities, or other sources, including project financing arrangements. Factors which could reduce our partners' available cash flows or impair their ability to obtain adequate financing include, among others:•declines in commodity prices, which reduce revenues and available cash flows;•changes in fiscal regimes impacting royalties, taxes, fees, resource access, or level of government participation in projects;•delay in government project approval, which could have a negative impact on the ability to obtain financing;•downgrades in credit rating or liquidity problems; •increased banking regulation which could reduce access to sources of funding or make funding more expensive; and•regional conflict, which could result in capital market reassessment of risk and withdrawal of capital.If these issues occurred and impacted our project partners, it could result in a delay or cancellation of a project, resulting in a reduction of our reserves and production, negatively impacting the timing and receipt of planned cash flows and expected profitability.Our operations require us to comply with a number of US and international laws and regulations, violations of which could result in substantial fines or sanctions and/or impair our ability to do business. Our operations require us to comply with complex and frequently-changing US and international laws and regulations, such as those involving anti-corruption, competition and antitrust, anti-boycott, anti-money laundering, import-export control, marketing, environmental and/or taxation.For example, the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and similar laws and regulations enacted or promulgated by countries pursuant to the 1997 Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development Anti-Bribery Convention generally prohibit improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business. The scope and enforcement of anti-corruption laws and regulations may vary. The UK Bribery Act of 2010, which became effective in 2011, is broader in scope than the FCPA and applies to public and private sector corruption and contains no facilitating payments exception. The import/export of equipment and supplies necessary for oil and gas exploration and development activities, as well as the export of crude oil and liquids production are regulated by the import/export laws of the US and other countries in which we operate. In the US, certain items required for oil and gas development activities may be considered “dual-use”, having both commercial and military applications and, therefore, may be subject to specific import or export restrictions. In addition, the US government imposes economic and trade sanctions against certain foreign countries and regimes. The sanctions are based on US foreign policy and national security goals and may change over time.Mergers of businesses often require the approval of certain government or regulatory agencies and such approval could contain terms, conditions, or restrictions that would be detrimental to our business after a merger. US antitrust laws require waiting periods and even after completion of a merger, governmental authorities could seek to block or challenge a merger as they deem necessary or desirable in the public interest. We have merged with or acquired other companies in the past. Prevention of a merger by antitrust laws could impair our ability to do business.In addition, in certain areas, legal enforcement may be impacted by significant new incentives for whistleblowers. Violations of any laws or regulations caused by either failure of our internal controls related to regulatory compliance or failure of our employees to comply with our internal policies could result in substantial civil or criminal fines, sanctions, or loss of our license to operate. In addition, as we continue to farm-in to exploration opportunities with new partners in new geographical locations, the risk of actual or alleged violation increases. Actual or alleged violations could damage our reputation, be expensive to defend, and impair our ability to do business. 37Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsDerivatives regulation included in current or proposed financial legislation and rulemaking could impact our ability to manage business and financial risks by restricting our use of derivative instruments as hedges against fluctuating commodity prices and interest rates. In the US, the Dodd-Frank Act, which was passed by Congress and signed into law in July 2010, contains significant derivatives regulation, including a requirement that certain transactions be cleared on exchanges and a requirement to post collateral (commonly referred to as “margin”) for such transactions. The Act provides for an exception from these clearing and collateral requirements for commercial end-users, such as us, and it includes a number of defined terms that will be used in determining how this exception applies to particular derivative transactions and the parties to those transactions. As required by the Dodd-Frank Act, the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has promulgated numerous rules to define these terms.In addition, it is possible that the CFTC, in conjunction with US prudential regulators, may mandate that financial counterparties entering into swap transactions with end-users must do so with credit support agreements in place, which could result in us being required to post collateral.We use derivative instruments with respect to a portion of our expected crude oil and natural gas production in order to reduce the impact of commodity price uncertainty and enhance the predictability of cash flows relating to the marketing of our production and in support of our capital investment program. We may use interest rate derivative instruments to minimize the impact of interest rate fluctuations associated with anticipated debt issuances. As commodity prices increase or interest rates decrease, our derivative liability positions increase; however, given our current investment grade status, none of our current derivative contracts require the posting of margin or similar cash collateral.Depending on the rules and definitions adopted by the CFTC and prudential regulators, we could be required to post significant amounts of collateral with our dealer counterparties for our derivative transactions. A sudden margin call triggered by rising commodity prices or falling interest rates would have an immediate negative impact on our business plan, forcing us to divert capital from exploration, development and production activities. Requirements to post cash collateral could result in negative impacts on our liquidity and financial flexibility and also cause us to incur additional debt and/or reduce capital investment. In addition, a requirement for our counterparties to post collateral would likely result in additional costs being passed on to us, thereby decreasing the effectiveness of our hedges and our profitability. In addition, the final CFTC rules may also require the counterparties to our derivative instruments to spin off some of their derivative activities to a separate entity, which may not be as creditworthy as the current counterparty.We face various risks associated with global populism.Globally, certain individuals and organizations are attempting to focus public attention on income distribution, wealth distribution, and corporate taxation levels, and implement income and wealth redistribution policies. These efforts, if they gain political traction, could result in increased taxation on individuals and/or corporations, as well as, potentially, increased regulation on companies and financial institutions. Our need to incur costs associated with responding to these developments or complying with any resulting new legal or regulatory requirements, as well as any potential increased tax expense, could increase our costs of doing business, reduce our financial flexibility and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of our operations.We face various risks associated with the trend toward increased anti-development activity. As new technologies have been applied to our industry, we have seen significant growth in non-OPEC crude oil and natural gas supply in recent years, particularly in the US. With this expansion of oil and gas development activity, opposition toward oil and gas drilling and development activity has been growing both in the US and globally. Companies in the oil and gas industry, such as us, can be the target of opposition to development from certain stakeholder groups. These anti-development efforts could be focused on: limiting hydrocarbon development; reducing access to national and state government lands; delaying or canceling certain projects such as offshore drilling, shale development, and pipeline construction; limiting or banning the use of hydraulic fracturing; blocking activity in certain areas such as the Arctic; denying air-quality permits for drilling; and advocating for increased regulations on shale drilling and hydraulic fracturing.In addition, the use of social media channels can be used to cause rapid, widespread reputational harm.Future anti-development efforts could result in the following:•blocked development;•denial or delay of drilling permits;•shortening of lease terms or reduction in lease size;•restrictions on installation or operation of gathering or processing facilities;38Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements•restrictions on the use of certain operating practices, such as hydraulic fracturing;•reduced access to water supplies or restrictions on water disposal;•limited access or damage to or destruction of our property;•legal challenges or lawsuits;•increased regulation of our business;•damaging publicity about the Company;•increased costs of doing business;•reduction in demand for our products; and•other adverse effects on our ability to develop our properties and expand production.Our need to incur costs associated with responding to these initiatives or complying with any new legal or regulatory requirements resulting from these activities that are substantial and not adequately provided for, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. A cyber incident could result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption and/or financial loss. The oil and gas industry has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct day-to-day operations including certain exploration, development and production activities. For example, software programs are used to interpret seismic data, manage drilling rigs, production equipment and gathering and transportation systems, conduct reservoir modeling and reserves estimation, and for compliance reporting. The use of mobile communication devices has increased rapidly. Industrial control systems such as SCADA (supervisory control and data acquisition) now control large scale processes that can include multiple sites and long distances, such as power generation and transmission, communications and oil and gas pipelines.We depend on digital technology, including information systems and related infrastructure as well as cloud applications and services, to process and record financial and operating data, communicate with our employees and business partners, analyze seismic and drilling information, estimate quantities of oil and gas reserves as well as other activities related to our business. Our business partners, including vendors, service providers, purchasers of our production, and financial institutions, are also dependent on digital technology. The technologies needed to conduct oil and gas exploration and development activities in deepwater, ultra-deepwater and shale, and global competition for oil and gas resources make certain information the target of theft or misappropriation.As dependence on digital technologies has increased, cyber incidents, including deliberate attacks or unintentional events, also has increased. A cyber attack could include gaining unauthorized access to digital systems for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, corrupting data, or causing operational disruption, or result in denial-of-service on websites. SCADA-based systems are potentially vulnerable to targeted cyber attacks due to their critical role in operations.Our technologies, systems, networks, and those of our business partners may become the target of cyber attacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of proprietary and other information, or other disruption of our business operations. In addition, certain cyber incidents, such as surveillance, may remain undetected for an extended period.A cyber incident involving our information systems and related infrastructure, or that of our business partners, could disrupt our business plans and negatively impact our operations in the following ways, among others:•unauthorized access to seismic data, reserves information or other sensitive or proprietary information could have a negative impact on our ability to compete for oil and gas resources;•data corruption, communication interruption, or other operational disruption during drilling activities could result in a dry hole cost or even drilling incidents;•data corruption or operational disruption of production infrastructure could result in loss of production, or accidental discharge;•a cyber attack on a vendor or service provider could result in supply chain disruptions which could delay or halt one of our major development projects, effectively delaying the start of cash flows from the project;•a cyber attack on a third party gathering or pipeline service provider could prevent us from marketing our production, resulting in a loss of revenues;•a cyber attack involving commodities exchanges or financial institutions could slow or halt commodities trading, thus preventing us from marketing our production or engaging in hedging activities, resulting in a loss of revenues;•a cyber attack which halts activities at a power generation facility or refinery using natural gas as feed stock could have a significant impact on the natural gas market, resulting in reduced demand for our production, lower natural gas prices, and reduced revenues;•a cyber attack on a communications network or power grid could cause operational disruption resulting in loss of revenues;•a deliberate corruption of our financial or operational data could result in events of non-compliance which could lead to regulatory fines or penalties; and39Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements•business interruptions could result in expensive remediation efforts, distraction of management, damage to our reputation, or a negative impact on the price of our common stock.As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities.Federal, state and local hydraulic fracturing legislation and regulation could increase our costs or restrict our ability to produce crude oil and natural gas economically and in commercial quantities.While hydraulic fracturing has been used for decades, opponents of hydraulic fracturing have called for further study of the technique's alleged environmental and health effects, additional regulation and, in some cases, a moratorium on the use of the technique. Several bills have been filed in the US Congress that, if implemented, would subject hydraulic fracturing to further regulation thereby limiting its use or increasing its cost. Because of elevated public sensitivity around the topic, federal and state governments are continually evaluating their regulatory programs and considering additional requirements on hydraulic fracturing practices. Additionally, some local municipalities have restricted or prohibited drilling activities, or are considering doing so. The U.S. Department of the Interior is currently working on its second draft of a federal regulation for hydraulic fracturing on federal and Native American lands. The draft rule has been estimated to have a potentially significant economic impact on the industry operating on federal or Native American lands. The final version of the rule is expected to be published and possibly implemented before the end of 2014. Additional federal, state or local restrictions on hydraulic fracturing that may be imposed in areas in which we conduct business, such as the DJ Basin or Marcellus Shale, could significantly increase our operating, capital and compliance costs as well as delay or halt our ability to develop crude oil and natural gas reserves. See Items 1. and 2. Business and Properties – Hydraulic Fracturing.The marketability of our onshore US, and deepwater Gulf of Mexico production is dependent upon transportation and processing facilities over which we may have no control.The marketability of our production from our onshore US areas and deepwater Gulf of Mexico depends in part upon the availability, proximity and capacity of pipelines, natural gas gathering systems, rail service, and processing facilities. We deliver crude oil and natural gas produced from these areas through gathering systems and pipelines, some of which we do not own. The lack of availability of capacity on third-party systems and facilities could reduce the price offered for our production or result in the shut-in of producing wells or the delay or discontinuance of development plans for properties. Even where we have some contractual control over the transportation of our production through firm transportation arrangements, third-party systems and facilities may be temporarily unavailable due to market conditions or mechanical reliability or other reasons, including adverse weather conditions.Third-party systems and facilities may not be available to us in the future at a price that is acceptable to us. Any significant change in market factors or other conditions affecting these infrastructure systems and facilities, as well as any delays in constructing new infrastructure systems and facilities, could delay production, thereby harming our business and, in turn, our results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.Restricted land access could reduce our ability to explore for and develop crude oil and natural gas reserves. Our ability to adequately explore for and develop crude oil and natural gas resources is affected by a number of factors related to access to land. Examples of factors which reduce our access to land include, among others:•new municipal or state land use regulations, which may restrict drilling locations or certain activities such as hydraulic fracturing;•local and municipal government control of land or zoning requirements, which can conflict with state law and deprive land owners of property development rights;•landowner and/or foreign governments' opposition to infrastructure development;•regulation of federal land by the BLM;•anti-development activities, which can reduce our access to leases through legal challenges or lawsuits, disruption of drilling, or damage to equipment;•disputes regarding leases; and•disputes with landowners, royalty owners, or other operators over such matters as title transfer, joint interest billing arrangements, revenue distribution, or production or cost sharing arrangements.Loss of access to land for which we own mineral rights could result in a reduction in our proved reserves and a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows. Reduced ability to obtain new leases could constrain our future growth and opportunity set by limiting the expansion of our portfolio.40Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsOur entry into new exploration ventures in areas which have no current hydrocarbon production subjects us to risks.We hold working interests in certain areas, each of which currently has minimal or no crude oil or natural gas production: northeast Nevada, offshore Cyprus, offshore the Falkland Islands, offshore Nicaragua and offshore Sierra Leone. Our activities will be subject to risks including, among others:•exploration activities in frontier areas may not result in commercially productive quantities of crude oil and natural gas reserves;•exploration activities on federal lands in northeast Nevada subject us to additional regulatory requirements as compared with such activities conducted on private land;•the remote location of the Falkland Islands makes it more difficult and time-consuming to transport personnel, equipment and supplies; •the operating environment offshore the Falkland Islands includes harsh weather and rough seas which could limit seismic surveys and other exploration activities during certain periods; and•there have been numerous acts of piracy, kidnapping, civil strife, regional conflict, border disputes, cross-border violence, and war, as well as violence associated with corruption, drug trafficking and regime changes in certain areas.These risks could be intensified if commercial quantities of oil or natural gas are discovered. We may not be able to compensate for or fully mitigate these risks. Our ability to produce crude oil and natural gas economically and in commercial quantities could be impaired if we are unable to acquire adequate supplies of water for our drilling operations or are unable to dispose of or recycle the water we use economically and in an environmentally safe manner.Drilling and development activities require the use of water. For example, the hydraulic fracturing process which we employ to produce commercial quantities of crude oil and natural gas from many reservoirs requires the use and disposal of significant quantities of water. In certain regions, there may be insufficient local capacity to provide a source of water for drilling activities. In those cases, water must be obtained from other sources and transported to the drilling site, adding to the operating cost. The development of new environmental initiatives or regulations related to water acquisition or waste water disposal could also limit our ability to use techniques such as hydraulic fracturing. Compliance with environmental regulations and permit requirements governing the withdrawal, storage and use of surface water or groundwater necessary for hydraulic fracturing of wells may increase our operating costs and cause delays, interruptions or termination of our operations, the extent of which cannot be predicted, all of which could have an adverse effect on our operations and financial condition. See Items 1. and 2. Business and Properties – Hydraulic Fracturing.Indebtedness may limit our liquidity and financial flexibility.As of December 31, 2013, we had $4.8 billion of long-term debt, of which $258 million is due within 12 months. Our indebtedness represented 35% of our total book capitalization (sum of debt plus shareholders' equity) at December 31, 2013.Our indebtedness affects our operations in several ways, including the following:•a portion of our cash flows from operating activities must be used to service our indebtedness and is not available for other purposes;•we may be at a competitive disadvantage as compared to similar companies that have less debt;•a covenant contained in our Credit Agreement provides that our total debt to capitalization ratio (as defined) will not exceed 65% at any time, which may limit our ability to borrow additional funds, thereby affecting our flexibility in planning for, and reacting to, changes in the economy and in our industry; •additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate or other purposes may have higher costs and more restrictive covenants;•changes in the credit ratings of our debt may negatively affect the cost, terms, conditions and/or availability of future financing, and lower ratings will increase the interest rate and fees we pay on our unsecured revolving credit facility (Credit Facility); and•we may be more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions.We may incur additional debt in order to fund our exploration, development and acquisition activities. A higher level of indebtedness increases the risk that our financial flexibility may deteriorate and we may default on our debt obligations. Our ability to meet our debt obligations and service our debt depends on future performance. General economic conditions, crude oil, natural gas, and NGL prices, and financial, business and other factors will affect our operations and our future performance. Many of these factors are beyond our control and we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to pay the interest on our debt, and future working capital, borrowings and equity financing may not be available to pay or refinance such debt. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 10. Long-Term Debt.41Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsIncreased banking regulation could result in reduced access to traditional sources of funding and limit our growth. In response to the global economic crisis of 2008, banking regulation has increased. New regulation includes the Basel III rules issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and the Final Report of the UK's Independent Commission on Banking (also known as the Vickers Report). These, and other potential regulations being considered by governing bodies in the US and other countries, are expected to impact the amount of capital required to be held by banks and the nature of such capital. As a result, traditional lending practices could change, resulting in more restricted access to funds or reduced availability of funds at rates and terms we consider to be economic. Increased regulation could also negatively impact the project finance market, even for investment grade companies such as we are, and reduce our ability to obtain funding for the capital requirements of future major development projects, such as a potential LNG project. Inability of us and/or our partners to obtain financing could result in delay or cancellation of future development projects, thus limiting our growth and future cash flows.Slower global economic growth rates may materially adversely impact our operating results and financial position. The recovery from the global economic crisis of 2008 and resulting recession has been slow and uneven. Market volatility and reduced consumer demand have increased economic uncertainty, and the current global economic growth rate is slower than what was experienced in the decade preceding the crisis. Many developed countries are constrained by long term structural government budget deficits and international financial markets and credit rating agencies are pressing for budgetary reform and discipline. This need for fiscal discipline is balanced by calls for continuing government stimulus and social spending as a result of the impacts of the global economic crisis. As major countries implement government fiscal reform, such measures, if they are undertaken too rapidly, could further undermine economic recovery, reducing demand and slowing growth. Impacts of the crisis could spread to China and other emerging markets, which have fueled global economic development in recent years, slowing their growth rates, reducing demand, and resulting in further drag on the global economy.Global economic growth drives demand for energy from all sources, including hydrocarbons. A lower future economic growth rate is likely to result in decreased demand growth for our crude oil and natural gas production. A decrease in demand, notwithstanding impacts from other factors, could potentially result in lower commodity prices, which would reduce our cash flows from operations, our profitability and our liquidity and financial position.We face significant competition and many of our competitors have resources in excess of our available resources.We operate in highly competitive areas of crude oil and natural gas exploration, development, acquisition and production. We face intense competition from: •large multi-national, integrated oil companies;•state-controlled national oil companies;•US independent oil and gas companies;•service companies engaging in exploration and production activities; and•private oil and gas equity funds.We face competition in a number of areas such as:•seeking to acquire desirable producing properties or new leases for future exploration;•marketing our crude oil and natural gas production;•seeking to acquire the equipment and expertise necessary to operate and develop properties; and•attracting and retaining employees with certain skills.Many of our competitors have financial and other resources substantially in excess of those available to us. Such companies may be able to pay more for seismic information and lease rights on crude oil and natural gas properties and exploratory prospects and to define, evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit. This highly competitive environment could have an adverse impact on our business.Exploratory drilling may not result in the discovery of commercially productive reservoirs.We depend on exploration success to provide growth in production and reserves and are planning an active exploratory drilling program in 2014. Exploratory drilling requires significant capital investment and does not always result in commercial quantities of hydrocarbons or new development projects.Exploratory dry holes can occur because seismic data and other technologies we use to determine potential exploratory drilling locations do not allow us to know conclusively prior to drilling a well that crude oil or natural gas is present or may be produced economically. In addition, a well may be successful in locating hydrocarbons, but we and our partners may decide not to develop the prospect due to other considerations. 42Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsExploratory drilling activities may be curtailed, delayed or canceled, or development plans may change, resulting in significant exploration expense, as a result of a variety of factors, including:•title problems;•near-term lease expiration;•decisions impacting allocation of capital;•compliance with environmental and other governmental requirements;•increases in the cost of, or shortages or delays in the availability of, drilling rigs, equipment and qualified personnel;•unexpected drilling conditions;•pressure or other irregularities in formations;•equipment failures or accidents; and•adverse weather conditions.In addition, companies seeking new reserves often face more difficult environments, such as oil sands, deepwater, or ultra-deepwater, and often need to develop or invest in new technologies. This increases cost as well as drilling risk.For certain capital-intensive offshore projects, it may take several years to evaluate the future potential of an exploratory well and make a determination of its economic viability, resulting in delays in cash flows from production start-up and a lower return on our investment.Due to our level of planned exploration activity, future dry hole cost could be material and have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows.Estimates of crude oil and natural gas reserves are not precise. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating crude oil and natural gas reserves and their value, including factors that are beyond our control. Reservoir engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of crude oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner. In accordance with the SEC's rules for oil and gas reserves reporting, our reserves estimates are based on 12-month average prices; therefore, reserves quantities will change when actual prices increase or decrease. The reserves estimates depend on a number of factors and assumptions that may vary considerably from actual results, including:•historical production from the area compared with production from other areas;•the assumed effects of regulations by governmental agencies, including the SEC;•assumptions concerning future crude oil, natural gas, and NGL prices;•anticipated development cycle time;•future development costs; •future operating costs;•impacts of cost recovery provisions in contracts with foreign governments;•severance and excise taxes; and•workover and remedial costs.For these reasons, estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of crude oil and natural gas attributable to any particular group of properties, classifications of those reserves based on risk of recovery, and estimates of the future net cash flows expected from them prepared by different petroleum engineers or by the same petroleum engineers but at different times may vary substantially. Estimation of crude oil and natural gas reserves in emerging areas or areas with limited historical production is inherently more difficult, and we may have less experience in such areas. Accordingly, reserves estimates may be subject to positive or negative revisions, and actual production, revenues and expenditures with respect to our reserves likely will vary, possibly materially, from estimates.Additionally, because some of our reserves estimates are calculated using volumetric analysis, those estimates are less reliable than the estimates based on a lengthy production history. Volumetric analysis involves estimating the volume of a reservoir based on the net feet of pay of the structure and an estimation of the area covered by the structure. In addition, realization or recognition of proved undeveloped reserves will depend on our development schedule and plans. A change in future development plans for proved undeveloped reserves could cause the discontinuation of the classification of these reserves as proved. See Items 1. and 2. Business and Properties – Proved Reserves Disclosures.We may be unable to make attractive acquisitions, successfully integrate acquired businesses and/or assets, or adjust to the effects of divestitures, causing a disruption to our business.One aspect of our business strategy calls for acquisitions of businesses and assets that complement or expand our current business. This may present greater risks for us than those faced by peer companies that do not consider acquisitions as a part of their business strategy. We may not be able to identify attractive acquisition opportunities. Even if we do identify attractive opportunities, we may not be able to complete the acquisition due to capital market constraints, even if such capital is available 43Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statementson commercially acceptable terms. If we acquire an additional business, we could have difficulty integrating its operations, systems, management and other personnel and technology with our own, or could assume unidentified or unforeseeable liabilities, resulting in a loss of value.We maintain an ongoing portfolio management program which includes sales of non-core, non-strategic assets. These transactions can also result in changes in operations, systems, or management and other personnel.Organizational modifications due to acquisitions, divestitures or other portfolio management actions, or other strategic changes can alter the risk and control environments, disrupt ongoing business, distract management and employees, increase expenses and adversely affect results of operations. Even if these challenges can be dealt with successfully, we cannot provide assurance that the anticipated benefits of any acquisition, divestiture or other strategic change may be realized.We may be unable to dispose of non-core, non-strategic assets on financially attractive terms, resulting in reduced cash proceeds and/or losses.We maintain an ongoing portfolio management program according to which we may divest non-core, non-strategic assets, such as our sale of certain onshore US and North Sea assets in 2013 and 2012. Asset divestitures can generate organizational and operational efficiencies as well as cash for use in our capital investment program or to repay outstanding debt. We strive to obtain the most attractive prices for our assets. However, various factors can materially affect our ability to dispose of assets on terms acceptable to us. Such factors include current commodity prices, laws and regulations impacting oil and gas operations in the areas where the assets are located, willingness of the purchaser to assume certain liabilities such as asset retirement obligations, our willingness to indemnify buyers for certain matters, and other factors. Inability to achieve a desired price for the assets, or underestimation of amounts of retained liabilities or indemnification obligations, can result in a reduction of cash proceeds, a loss on sale due to an excess of the asset's net book value over proceeds, or liabilities which must be settled in the future at amounts that are higher than we had expected.We operate in a litigious environment.Some of the jurisdictions within which we operate have proven to be litigious environments. Oil and gas companies, such as us, can be involved in various legal proceedings, such as title, royalty, or contractual disputes, in the ordinary course of business. For example, in the state of Louisiana, oil and gas companies are often the target of “legacy lawsuits,” by which a landowner claims that oil and gas operations, often performed many years ago and by another operator, caused pollution or contamination of a property. Various properties we have owned over the past decades potentially expose us to "legacy lawsuit" claims. Because we maintain a diversified portfolio of assets that includes both US and international projects, the complexity and types of legal procedures with which we may become involved may vary, and we could incur significant legal and support expenses in different jurisdictions. If we are not able to successfully defend ourselves, there could be a delay or even halt in our exploration, development or production activities or other business plans, resulting in a reduction in reserves, loss of production and reduced cash flows. Legal proceedings could result in a substantial liability and/or negative publicity about us and adversely affect the price of our common stock. In addition, legal proceedings distract management and other personnel from their primary responsibilities. Failure to fund continued capital expenditures could adversely affect our properties.Our exploration, development, and acquisition activities require substantial capital expenditures especially in the case of our major development projects. Development of LNG terminals or underwater pipelines for export of gas from Leviathan will require a multi-billion dollar investment. In addition, our CONSOL Carried Cost Obligation requires us to pay one-third of CONSOL's working interest share of certain future drilling and completion costs, up to approximately $2.1 billion, generally during periods in which average Henry Hub natural gas prices are above $4.00 per MMBtu. Major offshore projects have a long development cycle time, which means that development spending occurs for several years before the project begins producing and generating cash flows. Historically, we have funded our capital expenditures through a combination of cash flows from operations, our Credit Facility, debt issuances, and occasional sales of non-strategic assets. Future cash flows from operations are subject to a number of variables, such as the level of production from existing wells, prices of crude oil, natural gas and NGLs, and our success in finding, developing and producing new reserves. If revenues were to decrease as a result of lower crude oil, natural gas, or NGL prices or decreased production, and/or our access to debt or capital were limited, we would have a reduced ability to replace our reserves, resulting in lower production over time. If our cash flows from operations are not sufficient to meet our obligations and fund our capital investment program, we may not be able to access capital markets on an economic basis to meet these requirements. If we are not able to fund our capital expenditures, our ownership interests or rights to participate in some properties might be reduced or forfeited as a result. See Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – 2014 Capital Investment Program.44Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsWe are exposed to counterparty credit risk as a result of our receivables, hedging transactions and cash investments.We are exposed to risk of financial loss from trade, joint venture, and other receivables. We sell our crude oil, natural gas and NGLs to a variety of purchasers. In addition, we are the operator on a majority of our large joint venture development projects. As operator of the joint ventures, we pay joint venture expenses and make cash calls on our nonoperating partners for their respective shares of joint venture costs. These projects are capital cost intensive and, in some cases, a nonoperating partner may experience a delay in obtaining financing for its share of the joint venture costs. For example our partners in the Eastern Mediterranean must obtain financing for their share of significant development expenditures at Leviathan, which potentially includes an LNG project and/or major underwater pipeline, and offshore Cyprus.In addition, some of our purchasers and joint venture partners are not as creditworthy as we are and may experience credit downgrades or liquidity problems that may hinder their ability to obtain financing. Counterparty liquidity problems could result in a delay in our receiving proceeds from commodity sales or reimbursement of joint venture costs. Credit enhancements have been obtained from some parties in the way of parental guarantees, letters of credit or credit insurance; however, not all of our trade credit is protected through guarantees or credit support. Nonperformance by a trade creditor or joint venture partner could result in significant financial losses.Our hedging transactions expose us to risk of financial loss if a counterparty fails to perform under a derivative contract. During periods of falling commodity prices, our commodity derivative receivable positions increase, which increases our counterparty credit exposure. We conduct our hedging activities with a diverse group of investment grade major banks and market participants, and we monitor and manage our level of financial exposure. We use master agreements which allow us, in the event of default, to elect early termination of all contracts with the defaulting counterparty. If we choose to elect early termination, all asset and liability positions with the defaulting counterparty would be “net settled” at the time of election. “Net settlement” refers to a process by which all transactions between counterparties are resolved into a single amount owed by one party to the other.We had $1.1 billion in cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2013, a majority of which was invested in money market funds and short-term deposits with major financial institutions. We monitor the creditworthiness of the banks and financial institutions with which we invest and review the securities underlying our investment accounts. However, we are unable to predict sudden changes in solvency of our financial institutions. We monitor the creditworthiness of our trade creditors, joint venture partners, hedging counterparties and financial institutions on an ongoing basis. However, if one of them were to experience a sudden change in liquidity, it could impair their ability to perform under the terms of our contracts. We are unable to predict sudden changes in creditworthiness or ability to perform. Even if we do accurately predict sudden changes, our ability to negate the risk may be limited and we could incur significant financial losses.Commodity, interest rate and exchange rate hedging transactions may limit our potential gains.In order to reduce the impact of commodity price uncertainty and increase cash flow predictability relating to the marketing of our crude oil and natural gas, we enter into crude oil and natural gas price hedging arrangements with respect to a portion of our expected production. Our hedges, consisting of a series of derivative instrument contracts, are limited in duration, usually for periods of one to three years. While intended to reduce the effects of volatile crude oil and natural gas prices, such transactions may limit our potential gains if crude oil and natural gas prices rise over the price established by the arrangements.Global commodity prices are volatile. Such volatility challenges our ability to forecast and, as a result, it may become more difficult to manage our hedging program. In trying to manage our exposure to commodity price risk, we may end up hedging too much or too little, depending upon how our crude oil or natural gas volumes and our production mix fluctuate in the future. In addition, hedging transactions may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including instances in which: our production is less than expected; there is a widening of price basis differentials between delivery points for our production and the delivery point assumed in the hedge arrangement; the counterparties to our futures contracts fail to perform under the contracts; or a sudden unexpected event materially impacts crude oil or natural gas prices. We use interest rate derivative instruments to minimize the impact of interest rate fluctuations associated with anticipated debt issuances. Interest rates are variable and we may also end up hedging too much or too little when we attempt to effectively fix cash flows related to interest payments on an anticipated debt issuance.We have significant international operations and may enter into foreign currency derivative instruments in the future. Currency exchange rates are variable and we may also end up hedging too much or too little when we attempt to mitigate our foreign currency exchange risk.Our hedging transactions may not reduce the risk or minimize the effect of volatility in crude oil or natural gas prices, interest rates, or exchange rates. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 8. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.45Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsThe insurance we carry is insufficient to cover all of the risks we face, which could result in significant financial exposure. Exploration for and production of crude oil and natural gas can be hazardous, involving natural disasters and other unfortuitous events such as blowouts, well cratering, fire and explosion and loss of well control which can result in damage to or destruction of wells or production facilities, injury to persons, loss of life, or damage to property and the environment. Exploration and production activities are also subject to risk from political developments such as terrorist acts, piracy, civil disturbances, war, expropriation or nationalization of assets, which can cause loss of or damage to our property. As is customary with industry practices, we maintain insurance against many, but not all, potential perils confronting our operations and in coverage amounts and deductible levels that we believe to be economic. Consistent with that profile, our insurance program is structured to provide us financial protection from unfavorable loss severity resulting from damages to or the loss of physical assets or loss of human life, liability claims of third parties, and business interruption (loss of production) attributed to certain assets and including such occurrences as well blowouts and resulting oil spills, at a level that balances cost of insurance with our assessment of risk and our ability to achieve a reasonable rate of return on our investments. Although we believe the coverages and amounts of insurance carried are adequate and consistent with industry practice, we do not have insurance protection against all the risks we face, because we chose not to insure certain risks, insurance is not available at a level that balances the cost of insurance and our desired rates of return, or actual losses exceed coverage limits. We regularly review our risks of loss and the cost and availability of insurance and revise our insurance program accordingly.We expect the future availability and cost of insurance to be impacted by such events as hurricanes, earthquakes, tsunami and other natural disasters. Impacts could include: tighter underwriting standards; limitations on scope and amount of coverage; and higher premiums, and will depend, in part, on future changes in laws and regulations regarding exploration and production activities in the Gulf of Mexico and other areas in which we operate, including possible increases in liability caps for claims of damages from oil spills. We will continue to monitor the legislative and regulatory response to the Deepwater Horizon incident and its impact on the insurance market and our overall risk profile, and adjust our risk and insurance program to provide protection, at a level that we can afford considering the cost of insurance and our desired rates of return, against disruption to our operations and cash flows. If an event occurs that is not covered by insurance or not fully protected by insured limits, it could have a significant adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. See Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Risk and Insurance Program.We are subject to increasing governmental regulations and environmental requirements that may cause us to incur substantial incremental costs.Our business is subject to laws and regulations adopted or promulgated by international, federal, state and local authorities relating to the exploration for, and the development, production and marketing of, crude oil and natural gas. From time to time, in varying degrees, political developments and international, federal and state laws affect our operations. Changes in price controls, taxes and environmental laws relating to the crude oil and natural gas industry have the ability to substantially affect crude oil and natural gas production, operations and economics. We cannot always predict with certainty how agencies or courts will interpret existing laws and regulations or the effect these interpretations may have on our business or financial condition.Some of the complex laws and regulations our industry is subject to include: the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, as amended, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended, the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Endangered Species Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, and the Occupational Safety and Health Act. Environmental laws, in particular, can change frequently and at times may force us to incur additional costs as those changes are implemented, or in instances of possible non-compliance, we may be subject to penalties. Additionally, the discharge of natural gas, crude oil, or other pollutants into the air, soil or water may give rise to substantial liabilities on our part to government agencies and third parties, and may require us to incur substantial costs of remediation. Future legislation or regulation could potentially result in an increased risk of civil or criminal fines or sanctions. For example, fines or sanctions associated with a well incident or spill could well exceed the actual cost of containment and cleanup. Governmental fines or penalties could also be excessive. Further expansion of safety and performance regulations or an increase in liability for drilling activities, including punitive fines, may have one or more of the following impacts on our business:•increase the costs of drilling exploratory and development wells;•cause delays in, or preclude, the development of our projects resulting in longer development cycle times;•result in additional operating costs;•divert our cash flows from capital investments in order to maintain liquidity;•increase or remove liability caps for claims of damages from oil spills;46Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements•increase our share of civil or criminal fines or sanctions for actual or alleged violations if a well incident were to occur; and•limit our ability to obtain additional insurance coverage, at a level that balances the cost of insurance and our desired rates of return, to protect against any increase in liability.Any of the above operating or financial factors may result in a reduction of our cash flows, profitability, and the fair value of our properties or reduce our financial flexibility. Because we strive to achieve certain levels of return on our projects, an increase in our financial responsibility could result in certain of our planned projects becoming uneconomic. See Items 1. and 2. Business and Properties – Regulations.A change in US energy policy could have a significant impact on our operations and profitability.US energy policy and laws and regulations could change quickly, and substantial uncertainty exists about the nature of many potential rules and regulations that could impact the sources and uses of energy in the US. For example, new CAFE standards enacted in 2012 will result in a significant increase in the fuel economy of cars and light trucks and will reduce the future demand for crude oil for road transport use. GHG emissions regulations may increase the demand for natural gas as fuel for power generation. We design our exploration and development strategy and related capital investment programs years in advance. As a result, we are impacted in our ability to plan, invest and respond to potential changes in our business. This can result in a reduction of our cash flows and profitability to the extent we are unable to respond to sudden or significant changes in our operating environment due to changes in US energy policy.The unavailability or high cost of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies, other oil field services and personnel could adversely affect our ability to execute our exploration and development plans on a timely basis and within our budget.Our industry is cyclical and, from time to time, there is a shortage of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies and oilfield services. There may also be a shortage of trained and experienced personnel. During these periods, the costs of such items are substantially greater and their availability may be limited, particularly in areas of high activity and demand in which we concentrate, such as our core US operating areas, and in some international locations that typically have limited availability of equipment and personnel. During periods of increasing levels of industry exploration and production, such as is occurring in the DJ Basin and Marcellus Shale, the demand for, and cost of, drilling rigs and oilfield services increases. As exploration and production activity increases, so does the demand pressure for drilling rigs and oilfield services, which could result in sector inflation. In addition, regulatory changes, such as in response to the Deepwater Horizon incident or related to hydraulic fracturing, may also result in reduced availability and/or higher costs for these rigs and services. As a result, drilling rigs and oilfield services may not be available at rates that provide a satisfactory return on our investment. See Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Contractual Obligations. Provisions in our Certificate of Incorporation and Delaware law may inhibit a takeover of us. Under our Certificate of Incorporation, our Board of Directors is authorized to issue shares of our common or preferred stock without approval of our shareholders. Issuance of these shares could make it more difficult to acquire us without the approval of our Board of Directors as more shares would have to be acquired to gain control. In addition, Delaware law imposes restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15% or more of our outstanding common stock. These provisions may deter hostile takeover attempts that could result in an acquisition of us that would have been financially beneficial to our shareholders.
