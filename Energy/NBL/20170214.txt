Item 1A. Risk Factors and other sections of this report, which describe factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.PART IItems 1. and 2. Business and PropertiesIn this report, unless otherwise indicated or where the context otherwise requires, information includes that of Noble Energy, Inc. and its subsidiaries (Noble Energy, the Company, we or us). All references to production, sales volumes and reserves quantities are net to our interest unless otherwise indicated. For a summary of commonly used industry terms and abbreviations used in this report, see the Glossary, located at the end of this report.Noble Energy is a leading independent crude oil and natural gas exploration and production company with a diversified high-quality portfolio spanning three continents and consisting of both US unconventional and global offshore conventional assets. Founded in 1932, Noble Energy is a Delaware corporation, incorporated in 1969, and has been publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) since 1980. We have a unique history of growth, evolving from a regional crude oil and natural gas producer to a global exploration and production company included in the Standard & Poor's 500 (S&P 500). Our purpose, Energizing the World, Bettering People's Lives®, reflects our commitment to find and deliver energy through crude oil, natural gas and NGL exploration and production while living our commitment to contribute to the betterment of people's lives in the communities in which we operate. We strive to build trust through stakeholder engagement, act on our values, provide a safe work environment, respect our environment and care for our employees and the communities where we operate.Our portfolio of assets is diversified through US and international projects and production mix among crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs. In particular, our business is focused on both US unconventional basins and certain global conventional basins. We endeavor to maintain a high-quality, growth-oriented portfolio of assets that are well-positioned on the global industry cost supply curve. In addition, our asset portfolio offers operational and investment flexibility. In US unconventional basins, we have demonstrated competence in applying geological capabilities, drilling and completion expertise and midstream synergies to deliver incremental value. In onshore US, we typically apply a major project development concept to a US unconventional basin by utilizing an Integrated Development Plan (IDP) approach. In the global offshore, we have had notable exploration successes over the past decade, which have led to our entry into new conventional offshore basins, and have executed several major offshore development projects both on schedule and within budget which have provided long-lived cash flows to our business. 2Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsApproximately 75% of our 2017 capital program is allocated to US onshore development, primarily focused on liquids-rich opportunities in the DJ Basin, Delaware Basin and Eagle Ford Shale. Eastern Mediterranean capital expenditures, including initial development costs associated with the Leviathan project, represent over 20% of the total. As we manage our asset portfolio, we will consider expanding the portfolio to include additional long-term and/or large-scale exploration opportunities.In addition, the majority of our assets are held by production, which provides for further investment and financial flexibility. Occasional strategic acquisitions of producing or non-producing properties, combined with the periodic divestment of assets, have allowed us to pursue our objective of a well-diversified, growing portfolio delivering attractive financial returns. Oil and Gas Properties and Activities We search for crude oil and natural gas properties onshore and offshore, and seek to acquire exploration rights and conduct exploration activities in numerous areas of interest. Our activities include geophysical and geological evaluation; analysis of commercial, regulatory and political risks; and exploratory drilling, where appropriate. Our current portfolio consists primarily of interests in developed and undeveloped crude oil and natural gas leases and concessions. These properties contribute all of our crude oil, natural gas and NGL production, provide continual investment opportunities in proved areas, and offer further exploration opportunities. Our new venture areas provide frontier exploration opportunities, which may result in the establishment of new operational areas in the future. We also own midstream assets primarily used in the processing and transportation of our onshore US production.The map below illustrates the locations of our significant crude oil and natural gas exploration and production activities:Operating Segments  We manage our operations by region. Our segments, each of which is primarily in the business of crude oil, natural gas and NGL exploration, development, production and acquisition, include:•United States, including the onshore DJ Basin, Permian Basin, Eagle Ford Shale, Marcellus Shale, and offshore deepwater Gulf of Mexico, as well as the consolidated accounts of Noble Midstream Partners LP (Noble Midstream Partners), which completed its initial public offering of common units in 2016;•Eastern Mediterranean, including offshore Israel and Cyprus; •West Africa, including offshore Equatorial Guinea, Cameroon, and Gabon; and•Other International and Corporate, including new ventures such as offshore the Falkland Islands, Suriname, and Newfoundland. Development Activities Our development projects have resulted from both exploration success as well as periodic strategic acquisitions. These projects provide multiple opportunities for consistent growth at attractive financial returns. Each project progresses, as appropriate, through the various development phases including appraisal, engineering and design, development drilling, construction and production. While development projects require significant capital investments, typically over a multi-year period, they offer sustained cash flows and attractive financial returns, while generally increasing net asset value over the oil and gas business cycle. 3Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsOnshore US, our low production-risk development programs, typically centered around IDPs, provide a stable base of production. These programs, which have delivered significant historical production growth, accommodate a flexible capital investment program that can be varied in response to changes in the commodity price environment. We continue to enhance project performance in these areas through technology and operational efficiencies. Offshore, we engage in long-cycle development projects, such as the Tamar natural gas development, offshore Israel, which is currently undergoing expansion. We are also progressing a final investment decision for the first phase of development at the Leviathan natural gas field, offshore Israel, the largest natural gas discovery in our history.Our development activities are discussed in more detail in the sections below. Exploration Activities We primarily focus on organic growth from exploration and development drilling activities, concentrating on basins or plays where we have strategic competitive advantages. These advantages are derived from proprietary seismic data and operational expertise, which we believe will generate superior returns over the oil and gas business cycle. We have had substantial historic exploration success in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, the Levant Basin offshore Eastern Mediterranean and the Douala Basin offshore West Africa, resulting in the successful completion of numerous major development projects over the past decade. In 2016, we performed limited exploration activities due to the commodity price environment. Also, after review of additional 3D seismic data, modeling and economic assessment, we determined that certain discoveries offshore West Africa were impaired in the current forward outlook for crude oil prices and wrote off related capitalized costs of $468 million, which is included in exploration expense. See International – West Africa (Equatorial Guinea, Cameroon and Gabon) discussion, below. For 2017, we anticipate engaging in seismic acquisition and processing and potentially drilling an exploratory well offshore Suriname.Acquisition and Divestiture Activities We maintain an ongoing portfolio management program. Accordingly, we may engage in acquisitions of additional crude oil or natural gas properties and related assets through either direct acquisitions of the assets or acquisitions of entities that own the assets. We may also periodically divest assets through asset or equity sales, exchanges, dissolutions of joint ventures or other transactions. During 2016, we generated cash of approximately $1.5 billion through asset sales and the initial public offering of Noble Midstream Partners common units. See Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 3. Acquisitions, Divestitures and Merger. Pending Acquisition of Clayton Williams Energy, Inc. On January 13, 2017, we executed a definitive agreement to acquire all of the outstanding common stock of Clayton Williams Energy, Inc. (Clayton Williams Energy) for $2.7 billion in Noble Energy stock and cash. The acquisition includes 71,000 highly contiguous net acres in the core of the Southern Delaware Basin in Reeves and Ward counties in Texas (directly adjacent to our existing 47,200 net acres). In addition, there are an additional 100,000 net acres in other areas of the Permian Basin. The acquisition provides for increased opportunities to drill longer lateral wells on our combined acreage positions, enhances our crude oil production base and future crude oil growth potential, adds to our midstream assets and provides future midstream buildout opportunities.The transaction has been unanimously approved by the Boards of Directors of both Noble Energy and Clayton Williams Energy and is subject to approval by stockholders of Clayton Williams Energy. If approved, Clayton Williams Energy stockholders will receive 2.7874 shares of Noble Energy common stock and $34.75 in cash for each share of common stock held. In the aggregate, this totals 55 million shares of Noble Energy stock and $665 million in cash. The enterprise value of the transaction, based on Noble Energy's closing stock price as of January 13, 2017, is approximately $3.2 billion in the aggregate including the assumption of approximately $500 million in net debt. We intend to fund the cash portion of the acquisition through a draw on our revolving credit facility.Closing is expected to occur second quarter 2017 and is subject to customary regulatory approvals, approval by the holders of a majority of Clayton Williams Energy common stock, and certain other conditions.4Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsProved Oil and Gas Reserves Proved reserves at December 31, 2016 were as follows:  December 31, 2016  Proved Reserves  Crude Oil andCondensate Natural Gas NGLs TotalReserves Category (MMBbls) (Bcf) (MMBbls) (MMBoe) (1)Proved Developed        United States 138 1,817 113 554Israel 3 1,600 — 270Equatorial Guinea 34 486 12 127Total Proved Developed Reserves 175 3,903 125 951Proved Undeveloped        United States 158 1,021 94 422Israel — 384 — 64Total Proved Undeveloped Reserves 158 1,405 94 486Total Proved Reserves 333 5,308 219 1,437(1) Million barrels oil equivalent. Natural gas is converted on the basis of six Mcf of gas per one barrel of crude oil equivalent. This ratio reflects an energy content equivalency and not a price or revenue equivalency. Given commodity price disparities, the price for a barrel of crude oil equivalent for US natural gas and NGLs is significantly less than the price for a barrel of crude oil. In Israel, we sell natural gas under contracts where the majority of the price is fixed, resulting in less commodity price disparity. Our proved reserves totaled 1,437 MMBoe as of December 31, 2016 as compared with 1,421 MMBoe as of December 31, 2015. Changes primarily included the following:•positive revisions of 117 MMBoe related to our onshore US horizontal drilling programs and Alba field, offshore Equatorial Guinea, driven by increased well performance and/or lower operating or development costs in onshore US and the startup of the Alba B3 compression platform; and•extensions and other additions of 179 MMBoe related to our onshore US horizontal drilling programs due to successful expansion of our extended reach lateral well programs;offset by: •production volumes of 154 MMBoe; •negative revisions of 53 MMBoe that were commodity price driven; and •reduction of 77 MMBoe primarily due to our 3.5% reduction in ownership in Tamar, the impact of the Marcellus Shale acreage exchange, and other smaller onshore US divestitures.Our proved reserves are 68% US and 32% international, and the mix is 38% global liquids (crude oil and NGLs), 29% international natural gas and 33% US natural gas.See Proved Reserves Disclosures, below, and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Supplemental Oil and Gas Information (Unaudited) for further discussion of proved reserves.5Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsUnited StatesWe have been engaged in crude oil, natural gas and NGL exploration and development activities throughout onshore US since 1932 and in the Gulf of Mexico since 1968. US operations accounted for 73% of 2016 total consolidated sales volumes and 68% of total proved reserves at December 31, 2016. Approximately 48% of the proved reserves in the US are natural gas, 30% are crude oil and condensate and 22% are NGLs.Sales of production and estimates of proved reserves for our US operating areas were as follows:   Year Ended December 31, 2016 December 31, 2016  Sales Volumes Proved Reserves  Crude Oil &Condensate NaturalGas NGLs Total Crude Oil &Condensate NaturalGas NGLs Total  (MBbl/d) (MMcf/d) (MBbl/d) (MBoe/d) (MMBbls) (Bcf) (MMBbls) (MMBoe)DJ Basin 56 225 21 114 177 981 80 421Eagle Ford Shale 10 129 22 54 30 453 76 181Permian Basin 6 9 2 9 56 75 13 82Marcellus Shale 1 486 8 91 5 1,275 36 253Deepwater Gulf of Mexico 25 20 1 30 24 30 2 31Other Onshore US 1—12———3 4 24 — 8Total 99 881 54 301 296 2,838 207 976Wells drilled in 2016 and productive wells at December 31, 2016 for our US operating areas were as follows:   Year Ended December 31, 2016 December 31, 2016  Gross Wells Drilledor Participated in (1) Gross ProductiveWellsDJ Basin 134 6,961Eagle Ford Shale 22 318Permian Basin 19 242Marcellus Shale 17 238Deepwater Gulf of Mexico 2 15Other Onshore US — 21Total 194 7,795(1) Excludes exploratory wells drilled and suspended awaiting a sanctioned development plan or being assessed for economic viability. See Drilling Activity, below.6Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsUS OnshoreOur onshore US operations are located in proven basins with long-life production profiles and are typically developed utilizing an IDP, such as in the DJ Basin and now in the Permian Basin. These assets provide low production-risk drilling opportunities that offer predictable and long-term production, and a balanced commodity mix of crude oil, natural gas and NGLs. Locations of our onshore US operations as of December 31, 2016 are shown on the map below: DJ Basin   With the advent of horizontal drilling technology, the DJ Basin is recognized as a premier US crude oil resource play and is a key driver of our business and future growth. Our position in the area covers approximately 350,000 net acres. In 2016 and currently, we are focusing our drilling and development activity on IDP areas, such as Wells Ranch and East Pony, allowing us to consolidate processing and handling infrastructure across large areas (typically 30,000 to 80,000 acres). IDP’s are areas of highly contiguous acreage where we can accelerate drilling and completion activities and drill a much higher percentage of extended reach lateral wells. Additionally, our IDP approach has provided an opportunity to efficiently and economically support production growth by constructing and expanding our infrastructure, including constructing our own centralized production facilities, gathering systems, and water infrastructure, across the DJ Basin. 2016 Activity  In response to the current commodity price environment, we adopted a reduced but flexible 2016 capital program, and drilling efficiencies gained through longer laterals allowed us to continue an active drilling program in the basin. Operationally, we focused on reducing per unit operating costs while increasing operating efficiencies to support project returns and margin improvements. Through material efficiency gains in drilling, midstream expansions and synergies, and enhanced completion techniques, we were able to deliver 2016 production at lower capital and per unit operating costs than 2015.Through strategic acreage transactions, we expanded our extended reach lateral well program to approximately 50% of wells drilled in 2016. During the year, we spud 106 horizontal wells, of which 55 were extended reach lateral wells, and 124 wells initiated production. We also participated in approximately 28 non-operated development wells during 2016. Through continued active management of our portfolio, we facilitated certain asset monetizations which allow for the acceleration of asset development. In 2016, we:•closed an acreage exchange agreement to receive approximately 11,700 net acres within our Wells Ranch development area in exchange for approximately 13,500 net acres primarily from our Bronco development area, located southwest of Wells Ranch. The exchange enhances our ability to develop the field by improving our contiguous acreage position, increasing our lateral length potential and optimizing our access to central gathering facilities;•entered into an agreement to divest approximately 33,100 producing and undeveloped net acres in the Greeley Crescent area of Weld County, Colorado for $505 million, representing approximately 8% of our total DJ Basin acreage. We received proceeds of $486 million in 2016 and expect to receive the remaining proceeds in mid-2017. Proceeds received were applied to the field's basis with no recognition of gain or loss. As part of the transaction, all of the acreage in the Greeley Crescent IDP remains subject to dedications to Noble Midstream Partners for crude oil gathering, produced water services and fresh water services; and7Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements•sold certain other producing and non-producing assets, generating net proceeds of $20 million, which were applied to the field basis, with no recognition of gain or loss.See Proved Reserves Disclosures, below, and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Supplemental Oil and Gas Information (Unaudited) for discussion of proved reserves.The DJ Basin contributed an average of 114 MBoe/d of sales volumes in 2016, representing approximately 28% of total consolidated sales volumes. DJ Basin sales volumes were approximately 49% crude oil and 18% NGLs. At December 31, 2016, proved reserves in the DJ Basin represented approximately 29% of our total proved reserves. See Proved Reserves Disclosures, below.We exited 2016 with a two rig drilling program and intend to increase to three rigs in the second quarter of 2017. We remain engaged in a comprehensive effort to focus on capital and cost efficiencies and have adopted a capital spending program for 2017 that is supported by operating cash flows. Our spending program further provides flexibility to reassess activity levels in response to the commodity price environment as it evolves during the remainder of 2017.Midstream Activity On September 20, 2016, Noble Midstream Partners completed its initial public offering of common units, which provided access to capital markets to support funding of our onshore US midstream investment program. Noble Midstream Partners owns, operates and will develop certain of our DJ Basin crude oil, natural gas and water-related midstream infrastructure and will also develop crude oil and produced water midstream infrastructure in our Delaware Basin position of the Permian Basin.Permian Basin Our Permian Basin and Eagle Ford assets were added to our portfolio through the merger with Rosetta Resources Inc., on July 20, 2015 (Rosetta Merger), which increased our development inventory and further diversified our portfolio. Our operations in the Permian Basin are focused in Reeves County in the Southern Delaware Basin and as of December 31, 2016, we held approximately 40,000 net acres in the Delaware Basin and approximately 10,000 net acres in the Midland Basin.Encouraged by our 2016 well results, we executed strategic leasing initiatives and entered into a bolt-on acquisition, for $295 million, which closed in early 2017. The acquisition included seven producing wells, of which four will be operated by us. The combined transactions added approximately 7,200 net acres with 2,400 Boe/d, net, of production near our producing properties and increased our contiguous acreage position in the Reeves County area. Including our recently-announced acquisition of Clayton Williams Energy, which is expected to close in second quarter 2017, our Southern Delaware Basin acreage position will increase to approximately 120,000 net acres. See Pending Acquisition of Clayton Williams Energy, Inc., above. 2016 Activity We have tested multiple drilling and completion techniques utilizing slickwater, high intensity completions, increased proppant concentrations and longer laterals, which have led to stronger well performance and capital efficiencies. In 2016, we operated one to three drilling rigs, drilled nine horizontal wells and commenced production on nine operated wells. In addition, we engaged in the construction of certain midstream assets, including our first central gathering facility, which we expect will be online in 2017. For 2016, our assets in the Permian Basin contributed an average of 9 MBoe/d of sales volumes, representing approximately 2% of total consolidated sales volumes, and were approximately 67% crude oil and 17% NGLs. These assets represented approximately 6% of total proved reserves at December 31, 2016. For 2017, we started the year with three rigs operating on our current acreage in the Permian Basin, and Clayton Williams Energy started the year with one rig operating on its acreage. We plan to add a second rig to the new acreage in second quarter 2017, following closing of the Clayton Williams Energy acquisition, and a third rig later in the year, in order to exit 2017 with a combined six rigs running in the Delaware Basin. While our 2017 capital program will focus on long laterals, pad drilling and multi-zone testing for our Permian Basin assets, it provides for flexibility and can be modified in response to changes in the commodity price environment. Eagle Ford Shale  Since our entry into the Eagle Ford Shale, we have applied IDP learnings from other onshore US assets to realize cost efficiencies, enhance completion designs and optimize well placement, thereby positively impacting costs and performance associated with our Texas assets.We hold approximately 35,000 net acres located in the liquids-rich area of the play, including producing assets in Webb and Dimmit counties. Since acquiring these assets, we have worked to optimize drilling and completion designs to further develop both the Upper and Lower Eagle Ford zones, including the utilization of slickwater as a completion fluid and testing varying cluster spacing, lateral lengths and proppant quantities. 8Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements2016 Activity Our 2016 capital program was primarily focused within Webb and Dimmit counties where we operated one to two drilling rigs, drilled 22 horizontal wells and commenced production on 27 operated wells. We also closed the divestiture of certain assets located in La Salle, Atascosa, Live Oak and Dimmit counties where we had not engaged in drilling activities since the Rosetta Merger. Proceeds received totaled $68 million and were applied to the field's basis with no recognition of gain or loss.For 2016, our assets in the Eagle Ford Shale contributed an average of 54 MBoe/d of sales volumes, representing approximately 13% of total consolidated sales volumes, and were approximately 19% crude oil and 41% NGLs. These assets represented approximately 13% of total proved reserves at December 31, 2016. We exited 2016 with a two rig drilling program and in 2017, we will continue to evaluate results from our development program. Our capital program in 2017 provides flexibility to prudently manage our resources in response to changes in the commodity price environment.Marcellus Shale The Marcellus Shale contains a significant quantity of natural gas resources, and its proximity to high-demand East Coast markets has made it a desirable area for development. Infrastructure improvements and expanding firm transportation capacity are expected to improve export of product to areas outside the basin, reduce basis differentials, and have a positive impact on project economics. In an effort to allow flexibility and enhance control over the pace and scale of development of our Marcellus Shale investment, we and our joint venture partner, CONSOL Energy Inc. (CONSOL), agreed to terminate our 50-50 Joint Development Agreement (JDA) on October 29, 2016 with an effective date of October 1, 2016. In connection with the terminated JDA, we executed and closed an exchange agreement whereby we and CONSOL each transferred all of our interest in a portion of co-owned properties to one another. As a result, we now hold an almost 100% interest in approximately 363,000 acres, primarily located in the wet gas area of northwest West Virginia and a small acreage position in southwest Pennsylvania, with associated sales volumes of approximately 450 MMcfe/d. We anticipate a decline in sales volumes of approximately 100 MMcfe/d in 2017 and our proved reserves as of December 31, 2016 reflect divestment of approximately 185 Bcf (or 25 MMBoe, net of 4 MMBls of NGL reserves acquired) in the Marcellus Shale driven by our asset exchange. In addition to the acreage and production realignment between the two companies, we remitted a cash payment of approximately $213 million to CONSOL at closing. Terminating the JDA resulted in the elimination of the remaining outstanding contingent carry cost obligation of $1.6 billion due from us.2016 Activity  Prior to the termination of the JDA, the joint venture completed 17 wells and initiated production on 42 wells. During the year, we focused on well completions, while not performing any drilling activities in response to low commodity prices. However, operational performance remained strong, with volumes increasing 18% compared to 2015 and we achieved material reductions in operating expense as compared with the prior year. Our allocated capital investment in the Marcellus Shale was limited to the completion of previously-drilled wells in our non-operating dry gas areas. After the termination of the JDA, we focused on the completion of two wells in our wet gas areas.  The Marcellus Shale contributed an average of 546 MMcfe/d of sales volumes, approximately 22% of total consolidated sales volumes in 2016, and represented approximately 18% of total proved reserves at December 31, 2016. See also Proved Reserves Disclosures, below.Our 2017 capital program is flexible and includes the completion of previously drilled wells. We currently have no rigs running in the Marcellus Shale but have the potential to add one rig at year-end 2017.CONE Gathering We and CONSOL each own a 50% interest, and have joint control of CONE Gathering LLC (CONE Gathering), which constructs, owns and operates midstream infrastructure servicing our production in the Marcellus Shale. CONE Gathering owns the general partner controlling interest in CONE Midstream Partners LP (CONE Midstream), a master limited partnership, formed in late 2014. Through our 50% ownership interest in the general partner of CONE Midstream, we have significant influence over the management and operations of CONE Gathering and CONE Midstream in accordance with overall strategic plans, including the maintenance and development of our Marcellus Shale assets and monetization of natural gas production within the basin. During 2016, CONE Midstream continued to increase both revenues and average throughput as a result of new well connections and the impact of de-bottlenecking projects coming online. In fourth quarter 2016, CONE Midstream completed an acquisition of assets from CONE Gathering, which increased our ownership of CONE Midstream common units from 32.1% to 33.5%. CONE Gathering distributed cash of $70 million to us. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 7. Equity Method Investments.Bowdoin Sale  During 2016, we completed the sale of our Bowdoin property (north central Montana), generating proceeds of $43 million, and recognizing a $23 million loss.Deepwater Gulf of Mexico Locations of our operations in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico as of December 31, 2016 are shown on the map below: Our deepwater Gulf of Mexico operations resulted from lease acquisition, expansion of our 3D seismic database, and an oil-levered drilling program. We have several producing fields and an inventory of identified prospects, which are a combination of both high impact subsalt prospects and smaller tie-back opportunities. These prospects are subject to an ongoing technical maturation process and may or may not emerge as drillable options. We currently hold leases on approximately 70 deepwater Gulf of Mexico blocks, representing approximately 51,000 net developed acres and approximately 192,000 net undeveloped acres. We are the operator on nearly 80% of our leases. See also Developed and Undeveloped Acreage – Future Acreage Expirations, below. 2016 Activity  Our activity in 2016 primarily focused on commencing production from our Gunflint crude oil discovery, drilling our exploratory Silvergate prospect and the Katmai 2 appraisal well and performing certain remediation activities. We also successfully completed the planned decommissioning of the Raton field and the plug and abandonment work for Lorien. See Offshore Producing Properties and Update to Major Gulf of Mexico Projects, below. The deepwater Gulf of Mexico contributed an average of 30 MBoe/d of sales volumes in 2016, approximately 7% of total consolidated sales volumes, and represented approximately 2% of total proved reserves at December 31, 2016. Our 2016 capital program included the use of the Atwood Advantage drillship, which is under a multi-year contract for services and has been redeployed to offshore Israel. See Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Contractual Obligations. Our 2017 exploration budget has been reduced, but provides flexibility to respond to commodity price changes.During 2016, we completed our geological evaluation of certain deepwater Gulf of Mexico leases and determined that several leases, representing $91 million of undeveloped leasehold cost, should be impaired and written off. As a result, we recognized $58 million of undeveloped leasehold impairment expense and recorded a $33 million decrease in our valuation pool of individually insignificant leases. We have remaining capitalized undeveloped leasehold cost of approximately $105 million related to deepwater Gulf of Mexico prospects that have not yet been drilled. Leases representing over 75% of this cost are scheduled to expire over the years 2018 to 2020. In addition, some leases may become impaired if production is not established or should we not take action to extend the terms of the leases. As a result of our exploration activities, future undeveloped leasehold amortization and impairment expense could be significant.Offshore Producing Properties 9Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsGunflint (Mississippi Canyon Block 948; 31% operated working interest)  Gunflint is a 2008 crude oil discovery, utilizing a two-well subsea tieback to the Gulfstar 1 spar platform. Production commenced in July 2016 and contributed 4 MBoe/d of sales volumes in 2016. Rio Grande Development including Big Bend (Mississippi Canyon Block 698; 54% operated working interest) and Dantzler (Mississippi Canyon Block 782; 45% operated working interest) The Rio Grande crude oil development project consists of a single producing well from Big Bend, a 2012 crude oil discovery, and two producing wells from Dantzler, a 2013 crude oil discovery, flowing to the Thunder Hawk platform for which we assumed operatorship in 2016. The Rio Grande development commenced production in October 2015 and contributed an average of 16 MBoe/d of sales volumes in 2016.Galapagos Development Project including Isabela (Mississippi Canyon Block 562; 33.33% non-operated working interest), Santa Cruz (Mississippi Canyon Blocks 519/563; 23.25% operated working interest) and Santiago (Mississippi Canyon Block 519; 23.25% operated working interest)  The Galapagos crude oil development project consists of Isabela, a 2007 discovery, Santa Cruz, a 2009 discovery, and Santiago, a 2011 discovery. The Galapagos development began producing in 2012 and is connected to existing infrastructure through subsea tiebacks. During 2016, workover activities were conducted at Isabela to remediate the well, production commenced in the second half of 2016, and well stimulation was performed in fourth quarter 2016 to enhance recovery. Galapagos contributed an average of 5 MBoe/d of sales volumes in 2016.Swordfish (Viosca Knoll Blocks 917; 961 and 962; 85% operated working interest)  Swordfish is a 2001 crude oil discovery and began producing in 2005. The Swordfish project currently includes two producing wells flowing to the Neptune Spar, our floating offshore production platform. Ticonderoga (Green Canyon Block 768; 50% non-operated working interest) Ticonderoga is a 2004 crude oil discovery and began producing in 2006. The project currently includes two producing wells. These properties are connected to existing infrastructure through subsea tiebacks.Update to Major Gulf of Mexico Projects Silvergate (Mississippi Canyon Block 339; 50% operated working interest) Drilling operations were completed at our Silvergate exploration well. The well did not encounter commercial quantities of hydrocarbons and has been plugged and abandoned. In 2016, we recorded dry hole expense of $87 million associated with this well. Katmai (Green Canyon Block 40; 50% operated working interest)  During 2014, we announced successful final well results at the Katmai exploratory well. Katmai was drilled to a total depth of 27,900 feet in 2,100 feet of water. Wireline logging data indicated a total of 154 net feet of crude oil pay discovered in multiple reservoirs, including 117 net feet in Middle Miocene and 37 net feet in Lower Miocene reservoirs. In second quarter 2016, we spud our Katmai 2 appraisal well (38% operated working interest), located in Green Canyon Block 39, and encountered high pressure in the untested fault block. In response, we temporarily abandoned the well and are assessing plans to complete appraisal. As of December 31, 2016, we have capitalized approximately $43 million of costs associated with our Katmai 2 appraisal well. Troubadour (Mississippi Canyon Block 699; 60% operated working interest) Troubadour is a 2013 natural gas discovery for which we are currently evaluating development scenarios, including subsea tieback to existing infrastructure. Asset Impairments  We recorded property impairment expense of $158 million in 2015. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 5. Asset Impairments.Regulatory Environment Various federal agencies overseeing certain of our activities in the Gulf of Mexico have adopted new regulations and are considering others. See Regulations - US Offshore Regulatory Developments, Item 1A. Risk Factors, and Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Oil and Gas Exploration Expense. InternationalOur international business focuses on offshore opportunities in a number of countries and diversifies our portfolio. Development projects in the Eastern Mediterranean and West Africa contributed substantially to our growth over the last decade.Previous exploration successes offshore Israel, West Africa, and Cyprus have identified multiple major development projects that have the potential to contribute to production growth in the future.On the development side, during 2016, we began drilling the Tamar 8 development well and advanced Eastern Mediterranean regional natural gas export opportunities. Offshore Equatorial Guinea, the operator of the Alba field completed the Alba field compression project, resulting in extension of field life and improved field economics. We also wrote off capitalized exploratory costs related to certain discoveries offshore West Africa. See Eastern Mediterranean (Israel and Cyprus) and West Africa (Equatorial Guinea, Cameroon and Gabon), below.10Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsInternational operations accounted for 27% of total consolidated sales volumes in 2016 and 32% of total proved reserves at December 31, 2016. International proved reserves are approximately 89% natural gas and 11% crude oil, NGLs and condensate. Operations in Cyprus, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon and Suriname are conducted in accordance with the terms of Production Sharing Contracts (PSCs). In Cameroon, we operate in accordance with the terms of a mining concession. Operations in Israel, the Falkland Islands, and other foreign locations are conducted in accordance with concession agreements, permits or licenses. See Item 1A. Risk Factors.Locations of our international operations as of December 31, 2016 are shown on the map below:  Sales volumes and estimates of proved reserves for our international operating areas were as follows:  Year Ended December 31, 2016 December 31, 2016  Sales Volumes Proved Reserves  Crude Oil &Condensate Natural Gas NGLs Total Crude Oil &Condensate NaturalGas NGLs Total  (MBbl/d) (MMcf/d) (MBbl/d) (MBoe/d) (MMBbls) (Bcf) (MMBbls) (MMBoe)International                Israel — 281 — 47 3 1,984 — 334Equatorial Guinea 26 235 — 65 34 486 12 127Total International 26516—112372,47012 461Equity Investee 2 — 5 7 — — — —Total 28 516 5 119 37 2,470 12 461Equity Investee Share of Methanol Sales (MMgal) 162        11Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsWells drilled in 2016 and productive wells at December 31, 2016 in our international operating areas were as follows:  Year Ended December 31, 2016 December 31, 2016  Gross Wells Drilledor Participated in Gross ProductiveWellsInternational    Israel — 8Equatorial Guinea — 26Total International — 34Eastern Mediterranean (Israel and Cyprus) One of our operating areas is the Eastern Mediterranean, where we have drilled 12 successful exploration and appraisal wells and identified the existence of substantial natural gas resources since we obtained our first exploration license offshore Israel in 1998.Israel, the only producing country in our Eastern Mediterranean area, contributed an average of 281 MMcf/d of natural gas sales volumes in 2016, approximately 11% of total consolidated sales volumes, and represented approximately 23% of total proved reserves at December 31, 2016. Our leasehold position in the Eastern Mediterranean at December 31, 2016, included four leases and three licenses operated offshore Israel and one license operated offshore Cyprus. At December 31, 2016, the Eastern Mediterranean position included approximately 78,000 net developed acres and 116,000 net undeveloped acres located between 10 and 90 miles offshore Israel in water depths ranging from 700 feet to 6,500 feet. The license offshore Cyprus covers approximately 33,000 net undeveloped acres adjacent to our Israel acreage. Locations of our operations in the Eastern Mediterranean as of December 31, 2016 are shown below:Offshore Israel  Noble Energy and our partners have delivered reliable and cost effective natural gas to Israeli citizens for over a decade. During this time, we have reliably and consistently delivered approximately 1.9 Tcf, gross, of natural gas to Israeli customers, including the Israel Electric Corporation (IEC), the largest supplier of electricity in the country.We are the first company to construct, operate and produce from a major natural gas development project offshore Israel. Our Mari-B discovery provided the country with its first supply of domestic natural gas in 2004. In 2009, we discovered the Tamar field, another substantial natural gas resource. To maintain and increase natural gas supply to Israel, we developed the Tamar 12Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statementsfield with a discovery to production cycle time of approximately four years, which is exceptionally fast by global industry standards for an offshore natural gas project of this magnitude and complexity. We continue to partner with customers and the Government of Israel to provide a reliable fuel source to support affordable energy for the people of Israel. In 2010 we discovered the Leviathan field, our largest natural gas discovery to date. The quantity of discovered natural gas resources at Tamar and Leviathan positions Israel to meet domestic needs for decades and to become a significant natural gas exporter. Multiple natural gas customers exist in the region, and Israel’s domestic demand is predicted to continue to grow over the next decade primarily driven by increased use of natural gas over coal to fuel power generation.In addition to our natural gas discoveries, the Levant Basin is prospective for crude oil discoveries at greater depths. We conducted preliminary exploration activities in 2012 and are analyzing the potential for future exploration.Domestic Natural Gas Demand  As the Israeli economy continues to grow, the demand for natural gas used primarily for electricity generation is also expected to grow. Demand for natural gas in the industrial sector, including refineries, chemical, desalination, cement and other plants, as well as residential uses, is also increasing. These sectors are gaining confidence that a long-term supply of natural gas will be available and are now investing the capital necessary to convert facilities and infrastructure to use natural gas. In addition, government requirements for emissions reductions has also driven incremental demand for natural gas beginning in 2016. We have executed numerous natural gas sales and purchase agreements (GSPAs) with domestic customers. See International Marketing Activities and Delivery Commitments, below. Regional Demand and Exports  The Eastern Mediterranean presents an opportunity to match our low cost, abundant supply of natural gas with a substantially undersupplied regional market, including customers in Jordan and Egypt. With the Tamar field online providing reliable production, and the Leviathan Plan of Development approved by the Government of Israel and nearing final investment decision, we are well positioned to supply natural gas to the region for many years. Israel Natural Gas Projects Tamar  (32.5% operated working interest) The Tamar project began production in March 2013 and has peak flow rates of approximately 1.1 Bcf/d, gross, to support seasonal high demand periods. In 2015, we completed the Tamar compression project, which expanded field production capacity by adding compression at the Ashdod onshore terminal (AOT). Growth in power, industrial and residential demand in Israel, coupled with almost 100% uptime, enabled us to set new records for sales from our Tamar field, both on a quarterly basis of 313 MMcfe/d, net, during third quarter 2016 and on a cumulative gross production milestone of one trillion cubic feet from our Tamar field since initial production in first quarter 2013. Net production from Tamar averaged 281 MMcfe/d for 2016. In late October 2016, we spud the Tamar 8 development well which will increase supply reliability as demand for natural gas increases domestically.The Israel Natural Gas Framework (Framework) provides for reduction in our ownership interest in Tamar to 25% by year-end 2021. In mid-2016, we signed a definitive agreement to divest a portion of our interest in the Tamar field, and in December 2016, we closed the divestiture of 3.5% ownership interest, partially fulfilling this commitment required by the Framework. The total sales price was $431 million. After consideration of timing and tax adjustments, we received cash proceeds of $316 million at closing. Proceeds received were ratably allocated to the field's basis and resulted in the recognition of a $261 million gain. Our proved reserves as of December 31, 2016 reflect a reduction of 214 Bcf of natural gas driven by the divestiture.Tamar Southwest  (32.5% operated working interest) We continue to work with the Government of Israel to obtain regulatory approval of the development plan for our 2013 Tamar Southwest discovery, which is intended to utilize current Tamar infrastructure. Timely development of Tamar Southwest would help reinforce the reliability for our Tamar project and support increased customer demand.Tamar Expansion Project  (32.5% operated working interest) We have also engaged in the planning phase for the Tamar expansion project. The project would expand field deliverability to approximately 2.1 Bcf/d, a quantity that would allow for regional export. Expansion would include a third flow line component and additional producing wells. Leviathan Natural Gas Project (39.66% operated working interest)  The development of Leviathan will substantially expand our capacity to deliver natural gas to Israel and the region, as well as provide a second source of domestic natural gas supply and redundancy of infrastructure. Due to Leviathan's size, full field development is expected to require several development phases. Our Plan of Development was approved by the Government of Israel during mid-2016 and we and our partners are performing front-end engineering design (FEED) studies necessary to progress the project to final investment decision (project sanction) in early 2017 and are targeting production by the end of 2019. The initial Leviathan field development will be a subsea tie-back to a shallow-water platform with a connection to the Israel Natural Gas Lines (INGL) pipeline network. In fourth quarter 2016, we wrote off $88 million of capitalized concept selection costs associated with certain abandoned development concepts that are no longer viable. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 5. Asset Impairments.13Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsTiming of Leviathan project sanction depends on numerous factors, including completion of necessary marketing activities, engineering and construction planning and availability of funds from us and our partners to invest in the project. We have made significant progress on these fronts and are nearing project sanction.The marketing and development of natural gas from this asset is intended to serve both domestic demand and regional export. We are actively engaged in natural gas marketing activities and have executed multiple GSPAs for a total of up to approximately 525 MMcf/d, gross, or approximately 180 MMcf/d, net to Noble Energy, of natural gas from the Leviathan field. Our largest Leviathan GSPA, with the National Electric Power Company Ltd. (NEPCO) of Jordan, provides for sales of natural gas intended for consumption in power production facilities over a 15-year period. The execution of this agreement is subject to regulatory approvals from both Israel and Jordan. Sales to NEPCO are anticipated to commence at field startup. See Israel Natural Gas Framework and Regulatory Environment, below.Karish and Tanin  The Framework also provided for the divestiture of the Karish and Tanin discoveries, and, in November 2015, we executed an agreement to divest our 47% interest in the Alon A and Alon C offshore Israel licenses, which include the Karish and Tanin fields. The transaction closed in early 2016 for a total transaction value of $73 million ($67 million for asset consideration and $6 million from adjustment of costs). No gain or loss was recognized.Other Discoveries Offshore Israel Our development plan for the Dalit field (36% operated working interest), a 2009 natural gas discovery, was approved by the Government of Israel. Development includes a tieback to the Tamar platform. We are also analyzing 3D seismic data to evaluate the additional potential of the area, including the possible existence of hydrocarbons at deeper intervals. In July 2016, the Petroleum Commissioner of Israel deemed our Dolphin 1 (39.66% operated working interest) 2011 natural gas discovery to be non-commercial. As a result, we recorded exploration expense of $26 million in 2016 due to the expiration of our exploration license. Asset Impairments  During 2016 and 2015, we recorded impairment expense of $88 million and $36 million, respectively, related to offshore Israel properties. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 5. Asset Impairments.Israel Natural Gas Framework and Regulatory Environment We are subject to certain fiscal, antitrust and other regulatory challenges in Israel. These challenges have been addressed with the enactment of a comprehensive regulatory natural gas framework by the Government of Israel. See Regulations – Israel Natural Gas Framework and Item 1A. Risk Factors – Our Eastern Mediterranean natural gas marketing activities bear certain geopolitical, regulatory, economic and financial risks that could adversely impact our ability to monetize our Israel and Cyprus natural gas assets.Cyprus Project (Offshore Cyprus) During fourth quarter 2015, we entered into a farm-out agreement with a partner for a 35% interest in Block 12, which includes the Aphrodite natural gas discovery, for $171 million. We received initial proceeds of $131 million related to the farm-out agreement and received the remaining consideration, subject to post-close adjustments, in January 2017. The proceeds were applied to the field's basis with no gain or loss recognized. We will continue to operate with a 35% interest. As part of the farm-out process, we negotiated a waiver of our remaining exploration well obligation.During 2015, we submitted a Declaration of Commerciality and in mid-2016, we submitted an updated Development Plan to the Government of Cyprus. We continue to work with the Government of Cyprus to obtain approval of the development plan and the issuance of an Exploitation License for the Aphrodite field. Receiving an Exploitation License, in conjunction with securing markets for Aphrodite natural gas, will allow us and our partners to perform the necessary FEED studies and progress the project to final investment decision. In preparation for FEED, we and our partners are currently performing preliminary engineering and design (pre-FEED) for the potential development of Aphrodite field that, as currently planned, would deliver natural gas to potential customers in Cyprus and Egypt.West Africa (Equatorial Guinea, Cameroon and Gabon)  West Africa is one of our operating areas and includes the Alba field, Block O and Block I offshore Equatorial Guinea, the YoYo mining concession, offshore Cameroon, and one block offshore Gabon. In West Africa, our working interests can be burdened by overriding royalty interests and/or other government interests. As such, our working interests may differ from our revenue interests. Equatorial Guinea is currently our only producing country in our West Africa segment and, excluding the impact of equity investees, Equatorial Guinea contributed an average of 65 MBoe/d of sales volumes in 2016 and represented approximately 16% of total consolidated sales volumes. At December 31, 2016, Equatorial Guinea represented approximately 9% of total proved reserves. We held approximately 118,000 net developed acres and 10,000 net undeveloped acres in Equatorial Guinea, 168,000 net undeveloped acres in Cameroon, and 403,000 net undeveloped acres in Gabon at December 31, 2016. 14Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsLocations of our operations in Equatorial Guinea and Cameroon, as of December 31, 2016 are shown on the map below: Aseng Field  Aseng is an oil field on Block I (40% operated working interest, 38% revenue interest), offshore Equatorial Guinea, which began producing in 2011. The development includes five horizontal producing wells flowing to the Aseng FPSO where the crude oil is stored until sold, and natural gas and water are reinjected into the reservoir to maintain pressure and maximize crude oil recoveries. In late 2016, the Aseng field reached several milestones including cumulative crude oil production of 80 MMBbls since coming online in 2011. We also completed the first major turnaround since production commenced. During 2016, the Aseng Field produced approximately 9 MBoe/d, net.The Aseng FPSO is designed to act as a crude oil production hub, as well as liquids storage and offloading facility, with capabilities to support future subsea oil field developments in the area. It also has the ability to process and store condensate from natural gas condensate fields in the area, the first of which is Alen. Since it first came online, the Aseng field has maintained reliable and safe performance, averaging over 99% production uptime. Alen Field  Alen is a natural gas and condensate field primarily on Block O (51% operated working interest, 45% revenue interest), offshore Equatorial Guinea, which includes three production wells and three natural gas injection wells connected to a production platform that utilizes the Aseng FPSO for storage and offloading. Alen has been producing since 2013 and produced approximately 8 MBoe/d, net, during 2016. In December 2016, Alen surpassed the 30 MMBbls cumulative gross production milestone. This accomplishment was achieved with a remarkable safety record of over 900 days without a recordable or lost time incident.The Alen platform is expected to be utilized in our natural gas monetization efforts. See West Africa Natural Gas Monetization below.Alba Field Alba is a natural gas and condensate field located offshore, Equatorial Guinea (35% non-operated working interest, 34% revenue interest), which has been producing since 1991. Operations include the Alba field and related production and condensate storage facilities, an LPG processing plant where additional condensate is extracted along with LPGs, and a methanol plant capable of producing up to 3,100 gross metric tons per day. The LPG processing plant and the methanol plant are located on Bioko Island, Equatorial Guinea. During 2016, the Alba field produced an average of 55 MBoe/d, net, reflecting 48 MBoe/d attributable to total sales volumes and 7 MBoe/d attributable to an equity investee.During 2016, we along with the Alba field operator completed the Alba B3 compression project. Adding a compression platform to Alba is expected to extend the field life, and resulted in positive proved reserves revisions of 10 MMBoe at December 31, 2016.We sell our share of primary condensate produced in the Alba field under short-term contracts at market-based prices. We sell our share of natural gas production from the Alba field to the LPG plant, the methanol plant and an unaffiliated LNG plant. The LPG plant is owned by Alba Plant LLC (Alba Plant), in which we have a 28% interest. The methanol plant is owned by Atlantic Methanol Production Company, LLC (AMPCO), in which we have a 45% interest. AMPCO purchases natural gas from the Alba field under a contract that runs through 2026 and subsequently markets the produced methanol primarily to customers in the US and Europe. Alba Plant sells its LPG products and secondary condensate at our marine terminal at 15Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statementsprevailing market prices. In the first half of 2016, we completed scheduled turnaround activities for both the AMPCO methanol plant and the Alba LPG plant. We account for both Alba Plant and AMPCO as equity method investments and present our share of income as a component of revenues. We consider these equity method investments essential components of our business as well as necessary and integral elements of our value chain in support of ongoing operations in our West Africa operating area. Our Alba asset teams are fully engaged in operational and financial decisions and exert significant influence in the monetization of the Alba field and Alba Plant. We hold a voting position on AMPCO's leadership team through AMPCO's management committee, and our asset teams influence decisions regarding capital investments, budgets, turnarounds, maintenance and other project matters. Other Block O & I Projects In 2016, we analyzed, interpreted and evaluated acquired 3D seismic data across Blocks O and I. We determined that certain discoveries were impaired in the current forward outlook for crude oil prices and charged $468 million of capitalized exploratory well cost to exploration expense. We believe that the acreage attributable to the properties is currently subject to Blocks O and I PSCs which expire in 2036 and 2034, respectively.Cameroon We have an interest in approximately 168,000 undeveloped acres offshore Cameroon in our YoYo mining concession (100% operated working interest). The YoYo-1 exploratory well was drilled in 2007, discovering natural gas and condensate. We are working with the government of Cameroon to evaluate natural gas development options, as well as to convert the YoYo mining concession to a PSC, which will provide a more robust framework directly related to oil and gas operational activities. We have completed reprocessing of 3D seismic data over our YoYo mining concession and are currently evaluating the data. In 2016, we relinquished our acreage position in the Tilapia block (46.67% operated working interest), which covered an area of approximately 916,000 gross acres, to the Cameroon government and have exited this block. There was no significant impact to our 2016 financial results as dry hole costs relating to the Cheetah exploration well were expensed in 2015.West Africa Natural Gas Monetization We continue our efforts to monetize the significant natural gas resources represented by our discoveries offshore West Africa, including our 2007 Yolanda discovery (Block I) and 2008 Felicita discovery (Block O), offshore Equatorial Guinea, the YoYo discovery, offshore Cameroon, as well as natural gas from our Aseng and Alen fields. A natural gas development team is working with both governments to evaluate natural gas monetization concepts at Bioko Island. Our current development concept provides for subsea tieback of Blocks I and O discoveries to the Alen platform. In third quarter 2016, a data exchange agreement for the 2007 Yolanda discovery (Block I) and 2007 YoYo discovery was executed between the governments of Equatorial Guinea and Cameroon. The execution of the agreement marks a significant milestone as a first step towards unitization of any cross border resources. Offshore Gabon We are the operator of Block Doukou Dak (60% working interest), an undeveloped, deepwater area, covering approximately 671,000 gross acres. Our exploration commitment includes an obligation for 3D seismic, which was acquired during second quarter 2016 and is currently being processed. Final product delivery is anticipated early 2017.See also Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 6. Capitalized Exploratory Well Costs and Undeveloped Leasehold Costs.Other InternationalOur other international operations contributed no sales volumes for 2016 and had no proved reserves at December 31, 2016.Offshore Falkland Islands  In 2015, we experienced material operational issues with a drilling rig while drilling the Humpback well. The same drilling rig was scheduled to drill another prospect but due to significant safety and operational concerns, the drilling contract was terminated in first quarter 2016. As a result, we expensed $41 million of capitalized rig costs relating to pre-drill activities which is reflected in other operating expense, net, in the consolidated statements of operations. We have been working closely with our partners and the Falkland Islands Government to evaluate a path forward for our Rhea prospect, located in the North Falkland Basin adjacent to a third party's 2010 Sea Lion discovery, and in 2016, we received a three-year extension for this license. We also held certain other licenses located in the South Falkland Basin and following completion of our geological assessment, we exited all licenses outside of PL-001, which contains the Rhea prospect, which resulted in $25 million undeveloped leasehold impairment expense in 2016. An Argentine court has initiated a criminal investigation against Noble Energy and other oil and gas companies regarding their exploration activities offshore Falkland Islands. The court has also issued a preservation order against the relevant companies to preserve assets in the event of any judgment. The investigation is premised on Argentina’s claim that the Falkland Islands are a part of its territory. Argentina does not recognize the United Kingdom’s sovereignty over the Falkland Islands or the Falkland Islanders rights to exploit their natural resources. The Falkland Islands are part of the United Kingdom’s overseas territories and are afforded full self-governance. Our concessions are with the Falkland Islands Government and we do not believe that Argentina has any authority over our operations in the Falkland Islands. 16Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsOffshore Suriname In October 2015, we acquired a non-operated 20% working interest in Block 54 offshore Suriname in the Atlantic Ocean via farm-in from Tullow Oil plc (Tullow). Tullow is the operator with a 30% interest. We have acquired and processed 3D seismic information and are currently interpreting data. We currently anticipate participating in drilling activities in late 2017.Offshore Newfoundland, Canada  In November 2016, we acquired a non-operated 25% working interest in exploration parcels (blocks) 3, 4, and 8, and a non-operated 40% working interest in exploration parcel (block) 10. BP Canada Energy Group ULC is the operator of the blocks. We have acquired 3D seismic data which will allow us to assess the economic viability of this exploration prospect.North Sea The non-operated MacCulloch field is currently undergoing decommissioning activities. Due to its size and location, field abandonment is a multi-year process, requiring several phases. Therefore, our share of estimated field abandonment costs, recorded as an asset retirement obligation, may change over time.The operator of the MacCulloch field has notified working interest owners that the scope and magnitude of decommissioning activities has been revised downward, resulting in a potential adjustment of the project timeline with lower field abandonment costs. As of December 31, 2016, we had a total asset retirement obligation of $85 million related to this remediation project. As the operator moves beyond the initial decommissioning phase, we will continue to monitor the status and costs of the project and will adjust our estimate accordingly. Proved Reserves DisclosuresInternal Controls Over Reserves Estimates  Our policies and processes regarding internal controls over the recording of reserves estimates require reserves to be in compliance with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) definitions and guidance and prepared in accordance with Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Engineers. Our internal controls over reserves estimates also include the following:•the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors reviews significant reserves changes on an annual basis;•fields that meet a minimum reserve quantity threshold, newly sanctioned development projects, and certain fields selected on a rotational basis, which combined represent over 80% of our proved reserves, are audited by Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc. (NSAI), a third-party petroleum consulting firm, on an annual basis; and•NSAI is engaged by, and has direct access to, the Audit Committee. See Third-Party Reserves Audit, below.Responsibility for compliance in reserves estimation is delegated to our Corporate Reservoir Engineering group. Qualified petroleum engineers in our Houston and Denver offices prepare all reserves estimates for our different geographical regions. These reserves estimates are reviewed and approved by regional management and senior engineering staff with final approval by the Senior Vice President – Corporate Development and certain other members of senior management.Our Senior Vice President – Corporate Development oversees our corporate business development, strategic planning, environmental analysis and reserves departments. He is the technical person primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of our reserves estimates and the third-party audit of our reserves estimates. He has Bachelor of Science and Master of Science degrees in Petroleum Engineering and over 36 years of industry experience with positions of increasing responsibility in engineering, evaluations, and business unit management at the Company. The Senior Vice President – Corporate Development reports directly to our Chief Executive Officer.Technologies Used in Reserves Estimation The SEC’s reserves rules allow the use of techniques that have been proved effective by actual production from projects in the same reservoir or an analogous reservoir or by other evidence using reliable technology that establishes reasonable certainty. Reliable technology is a grouping of one or more technologies (including computational methods) that has been field tested and has been demonstrated to provide reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability in the formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation.We used a combination of production and pressure performance, wireline wellbore measurements, simulation studies, offset analogies, seismic data and interpretation, wireline formation tests, geophysical logs and core data to calculate our reserves estimates, including the material additions to the 2016 reserves estimates.Based on reasonable certainty of reservoir continuity in US onshore formations where we operate, we may record proved reserves associated with wells more than one offset location away from an existing proved producing well. All of our wells drilled that were more than one offset away from a proved producing well at the time of drilling were determined to be economically producible.Third-Party Reserves Audit  In each of the years 2016, 2015, and 2014, we retained NSAI to perform audits of proved reserves. The reserves audit for 2016 included a detailed review of nine of our major onshore US, deepwater Gulf of Mexico and international fields, which covered approximately 88% of US proved reserves and 99.9% of international proved reserves (92% of total proved reserves). The reserves audit for 2015 included a detailed review of nine of our major fields and covered 17Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statementsapproximately 91% of total proved reserves. The reserves audit for 2014 included a detailed review of eight of our major fields and covered approximately 88% of total proved reserves.In connection with the 2016 reserves audit, NSAI prepared its own estimates of our proved reserves. In order to prepare its estimates of proved reserves, NSAI examined our estimates with respect to reserves quantities, future production rates, future net revenue, and the present value of such future net revenue. NSAI also examined our estimates with respect to reserves categorization, using the definitions for proved reserves set forth in Regulation S-X Rule 4-10(a) and subsequent SEC staff interpretations and guidance.In the conduct of the reserves audit, NSAI did not independently verify the accuracy and completeness of information and data furnished by us with respect to ownership interests, crude oil and natural gas production, well test data, historical costs of operation and development, product prices, or any agreements relating to current and future operations of the fields and sales of production. However, if in the course of the examination something came to the attention of NSAI which brought into question the validity or sufficiency of any such information or data, NSAI did not rely on such information or data until it had satisfactorily resolved its questions relating thereto or had independently verified such information or data.NSAI determined that our estimates of reserves have been prepared in accordance with the definitions and regulations of the SEC, including the criteria of “reasonable certainty,” as it pertains to expectations about the recoverability of reserves in future years, under existing economic and operating conditions, consistent with the definition in Rule 4-10(a)(24) of Regulation S-X. NSAI issued an unqualified audit opinion on our proved reserves at December 31, 2016, based upon their evaluation. NSAI concluded that our estimates of proved reserves were, in the aggregate, reasonable and have been prepared in accordance with Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Engineers. NSAI’s report is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.When compared on a field-by-field basis, some of our estimates are greater and some are less than the estimates of NSAI. Given the inherent uncertainties and judgments that go into estimating proved reserves, differences between internal and external estimates are to be expected. For proved reserves at December 31, 2016, on a quantity basis, the NSAI field estimates ranged from 3.1 MMBoe or 2% above to 6 MMBoe or 7% below as compared with our estimates on a field-by-field basis. Differences between our estimates and those of NSAI are reviewed for accuracy but are not further analyzed unless the aggregate variance is greater than 10%. Reserves differences at December 31, 2016 were, in the aggregate, approximately 27.9 MMBoe, or 2%.Proved ReservesWe have historically added reserves through our exploration program, development activities, and acquisition of producing properties. Changes in proved reserves were as follows:  Year Ended December 31,  2016 2015 2014(MMBoe)      Proved Reserves Beginning of Year 1,421 1,404 1,406Revisions of Previous Estimates 64 (216) 21Extensions, Discoveries and Other Additions 179 100 120Purchase of Minerals in Place 4 269 —Sale of Minerals in Place (77) (6) (33)Production (154) (130) (110)Proved Reserves End of Year 1,437 1,421 1,404Revisions  Revisions of previous estimates represent changes in previous reserves estimates, either upward (positive) or downward (negative), resulting from new information normally obtained from development drilling and production history or resulting from a change in economic factors, such as commodity prices, operating costs, development costs or abandonment costs. Revisions included the following:•changes for the year ended December 31, 2016 include positive revisions of 43 MMBoe for the DJ Basin, 42 MMBoe for the Marcellus Shale, 11 MMBoe for the Permian Basin, 6 MMBoe for deepwater Gulf of Mexico, 5 MMBoe for other onshore US and 10 MMBoe for Alba field, offshore Equatorial Guinea, due to increased performance and/or lower development or operating costs; partially offset by negative revisions of 53 MMBoe due to lower commodity prices; •changes for the year ended December 31, 2015 include negative revisions of 307 MMBoe due to lower commodity prices, downward revisions of 9 MMBoe and 5 MMBoe for the DJ Basin and Eagle Ford Shale, respectively, primarily due to current drilling and development plans in the DJ Basin and expected reserve recovery from existing producing wells in the Eagle Ford Shale, and downward revisions of 3 MMBoe due to natural field decline from the Mari-B field, 18Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statementsoffshore Israel; offset by positive performance revisions of 81 MMBoe for the Marcellus Shale, 17 MMBoe for the Permian Basin and 10 MMBoe for Alba field; and•changes for the year ended December 31, 2014 included positive performance revisions of 18 MMBoe for the Marcellus Shale, 4 MMBoe for deepwater Gulf of Mexico, 4 MMBoe for Alba field, and 3 MMBoe for the Tamar field; offset by a downward revision of 8 MMBoe for the DJ Basin primarily due to planned reduction in pace of drilling activity due to lower commodity prices.Extensions, Discoveries and Other Additions  These are additions to proved reserves that result from (1) extension of the proved acreage of previously discovered reservoirs through additional drilling in periods subsequent to discovery and (2) discovery of new fields with proved reserves or of new reservoirs of proved reserves in old fields. Extensions, discoveries and other additions included the following:•changes for the year ended December 31, 2016 include increases of 83 MMBoe in the DJ Basin, 42 MMBoe in the Marcellus Shale, 33 MMBoe in the Permian Basin and 21 MMBoe in the Eagle Ford Shale, all associated with our horizontal drilling programs;•changes for the year ended December 31, 2015 include increases of 86 MMBoe in the DJ Basin and 14 MMBoe in the Marcellus Shale associated with our horizontal drilling programs; and•changes for the year ended December 31, 2014 included increases of 48 MMBoe in the DJ Basin, 62 MMBoe in the Marcellus Shale, and 10 MMBoe deepwater Gulf of Mexico primarily attributable to sanction of the Dantzler development. Approximately 75% of our 2017 capital program is allocated to onshore US, primarily in the DJ Basin, Delaware Basin and Eagle Ford Shale, and over 20% is allocated to offshore Israel. In turn, we expect that future reserves additions will primarily come from our development projects onshore US and offshore Israel. Potential new discoveries resulting from our exploration programs in our operational areas as well as global new ventures programs could also lead to future reserve additions. In addition, we may also purchase proved properties in strategic acquisitions. See Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources – Acquisition, Capital and Other Exploration Expenditures.Purchase of Minerals in Place  We occasionally enhance our asset portfolio with strategic acquisitions of producing properties. Purchases included the following:•an increase of 4 MMBoe of NGL reserves primarily resulting from our Marcellus Shale acreage exchange in 2016; and •the acquisition of additional acreage, primarily in the Eagle Ford Shale and Permian Basin in Texas in 2015 in connection with the Rosetta Merger. Sale of Minerals in Place We maintain an ongoing portfolio management program through which we may periodically divest assets. Sales included the following:•a reduction of 36 MMBoe in Israel driven by our 3.5% sale of Tamar working interest, divestment of 29 MMBoe in the Marcellus Shale driven by our asset exchange, and other smaller divestments in onshore US resulting in a reduction of 12 MMBoe in 2016;•the sale of onshore US assets in 2015; and•the sale of onshore US and China assets in 2014.See Items 1. and 2.

Changes in PUDs that occurred during the year are summarized below:  United States Israel EquatorialGuinea Total(MMBoe)        Proved Undeveloped Reserves Beginning of Year 344 71 70 485Revisions of Previous Estimates 32 — — 32Extensions, Discoveries and Other Additions 166 — — 166Purchase of Minerals in Place — — — —Sale of Minerals in Place (22) (7) — (29)Conversion to Proved Developed (98) — (70) (168)Proved Undeveloped Reserves End of Year 422 64 — 486Revisions of previous estimates include the transfer of PUDs to unproved reserve categories as a result of changes in development plans and/or the impact of changes in commodity prices, and the addition of new PUDs arising from current development plans. Positive revisions of 32 MMBoe in the US for 2016 included:•53 MMBoe positive revisions primarily in the DJ Basin, Marcellus Shale and Permian Basin due to current drilling and development plans; offset by: •negative revisions of 21 MMBoe due to lower commodity prices.Extensions, discoveries and other additions include addition of proved reserves through additional drilling or the discovery of new reservoirs in proven fields. During 2016, we recorded the following additions as a result of successful expansion of our extended reach lateral well programs:•76 MMBoe in the DJ Basin;•31 MMBoe in the Permian Basin; •19 MMBoe in the Eagle Ford Shale; and •40 MMBoe in the Marcellus Shale.Conversion to proved developed reserves included the following transfers:•26 MMBoe in the DJ Basin;•1 MMBoe in the Permian;•25 MMBoe in the Eagle Ford Shale;•33 MMBoe in the Marcellus Shale; •13 MMBoe in deepwater Gulf of Mexico; and •70 MMBoe in the Alba Field, offshore Equatorial Guinea.In 2016, we converted 98 MMBoe of our US PUDs, or 28% of our US PUDs balance, to developed status. Based on our current inventory of identified horizontal well locations and our anticipated rate of drilling and completion activity, we expect our US PUDs recorded as of December 31, 2016 to be converted to proved developed reserves within five years of initial disclosure.US PUDs Locations As of December 31, 2016, our US PUDs included:•199 MMBoe in the DJ Basin;•70 MMBoe in the Permian Basin; •92 MMBoe in the Eagle Ford Shale; and•61 MMBoe in the Marcellus Shale.Our PUDs are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage or from existing wells where additional capital expenditures are required for completion, such as drilled but uncompleted (DUC) wells. As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 81 MMBoe of proved undeveloped reserves associated with DUC well locations related to our onshore US operations, approximately 40% and 30% of which are in the Marcellus Shale and the Eagle Ford Shale, respectively, and the remainder are in the DJ Basin and Permian Basin.International PUDs Locations As of December 31, 2016, our international PUDs included 64 MMBoe in Israel primarily in the Tamar and Tamar Southwest fields, including PUDs of 29 MMBoe related to the Tamar Southwest field, which is awaiting government approval of the development plan. We expect these PUDs to be converted to proved developed reserves within five years of initial disclosure.20Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsDevelopment Costs Costs incurred to advance the development of PUDs were approximately $656 million in 2016, $1.5 billion in 2015, and $2.0 billion in 2014. A significant portion of costs incurred in 2016 related to the DJ Basin, deepwater Gulf of Mexico and Marcellus Shale development projects.Estimated future development costs relating to the development of PUDs are projected to be approximately $1.1 billion in 2017, $0.9 billion in 2018, and $0.8 billion in 2019. Estimated future development costs include capital spending on development projects and PUDs related to development projects will be reclassified to proved developed reserves when production commences.Drilling Plans  Our long range development plans will result in the conversion of all PUDs to developed reserves within five years of their initial disclosure. All PUD drilling locations are scheduled to be drilled prior to the end of 2021. Initial production from these PUDs is expected to begin during the years 2017 to 2021.PUDs with Negative PV10  In accordance with US GAAP, we disclose a standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows related to our proved reserves. In order to standardize the measure, all companies are required to use a 10% discount rate and SEC pricing rules. Although our PUD reserves meet the SEC definition, this prescribed calculation can result in some PUDs having negative present worth, meaning while we have positive cash flows, the rate of return is lower than 10%.At December 31, 2016, we had 133 well locations, primarily located in the DJ Basin and Marcellus Shale, with a negative present worth when discounted at 10% and based on SEC prices. Although these PUD reserves had a negative present worth when discounted at 10%, they generated positive future net revenues.We consider the economic development of reserves based on our estimates of future pricing, future investments, production and other economic factors that are excluded from the SEC reserves requirements and are committed to developing these reserves within five years of initial disclosure.

The methanol and LPG plants are owned by affiliated entities accounted for under the equity method.(3) Volumes represent sales of condensate and LPG from the LPG plant in Equatorial Guinea. Revenues from sales of crude oil, natural gas and NGLs have accounted for 90% or more of consolidated revenues for each of the last three fiscal years.At December 31, 2016, our operated properties accounted for the majority of our total production. Being the operator of a property improves our ability to directly influence production levels and the timing of projects, while also enhancing our control over operating expenses and capital expenditures.Productive Wells  The number of productive crude oil and natural gas wells in which we held an interest at December 31, 2016 was as follows:  Crude Oil Wells Natural Gas Wells Total  Gross Net Gross Net Gross NetUnited States 3,974 3,628 3,821 3,501 7,795 7,129Israel — — 8 3 8 3Equatorial Guinea 5 2 21 8 26 10Total 3,979 3,630 3,850 3,512 7,829 7,142 Productive wells are producing wells and wells mechanically capable of production. A gross well is a well in which a working interest is owned. The number of gross wells is the total number of wells in which a working interest is owned. The number of net wells is the sum of the fractional working interests owned in gross wells expressed as whole numbers and fractions thereof. Wells with multiple completions are counted as one well in the table above.Developed and Undeveloped Acreage Developed and undeveloped acreage (including both leases and concessions) held at December 31, 2016 was as follows:   Developed Acreage Undeveloped Acreage  Gross Net Gross Net(thousands of acres)        United States        Onshore 902 768 694 430Deepwater Gulf of Mexico 100 51 282 192Total United States 1,002 819 976 622International        Israel 185 78 284 116Equatorial Guinea (1) 284 118 26 10Suriname — — 2,095 419Newfoundland — — 1,942 525Gabon — — 671 403Cyprus — — 95 33Falkland Islands (2) — — 280 210Cameroon — — 168 168United Kingdom 2 — 4 1Total International 471 196 5,565 1,885Total 1,473 1,015 6,541 2,507(1) Undeveloped acreage excludes an exploration lease totaling approximately 55,000 gross (19,000 net) acres which expired in 2016. We are negotiating with the government of Equatorial Guinea to extend the lease. (2) Following completion of our geological assessment in 2016, we exited all licenses in the Falklands Islands, outside of License PL-001, which contains the Rhea prospect, thereby reducing our acreage position by approximately 10 million, gross, and 3 million, net, acres. Developed acreage is comprised of leased acres that are within an area spaced by or assignable to a productive well.Undeveloped acreage is comprised of leased acres with defined remaining terms and not within an area spaced by or assignable to a productive well.A gross acre is any leased acre in which a working interest is owned. A net acre is comprised of the total of the owned working interest(s) in a gross acre expressed in a fractional format. 23Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsFuture Acreage Expirations If production is not established or we take no other action to extend the terms of the leases, licenses, or concessions, undeveloped acreage will expire over the next three years as follows.

Oil Spill Response Preparedness In the US, we maintain membership in Clean Gulf Associates (CGA), a nonprofit association of production and pipeline companies operating in the Gulf of Mexico, and Marine Spill Response Corporation, the largest, dedicated oil spill and emergency response organization in the US. For well capping and containment services we have contracted with HWCG, which has contracted with Helix Energy Solutions Group (HESG) for the provision of subsea intervention, containment, capture and shut-in capacity for deepwater Gulf of Mexico exploratory wells. 24Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsInternationally, we maintain membership in Oil Spill Response Limited (OSRL), an industry-owned cooperative. We also maintain agreements internationally with National Response Corporation and PolyEco Group, which provide leased response equipment as well as supplemental oil spill response services. Additionally, in Equatorial Guinea, we are members of the Oil and Gas Operators Emergency Resource Allocation Group which shares equipment and resources in the event of a spill. Domestic Marketing Activities Crude oil, natural gas, condensate and NGLs produced onshore US and in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico are sold under short-term and long-term contracts at market-based prices adjusted for location and quality. Onshore production of crude oil and condensate is distributed through pipelines and by trucks and rail cars to gatherers, transportation companies and refineries. Gulf of Mexico production is distributed through pipelines.Certain onshore US areas in which we operate have had minimal infrastructure in place for the processing and transportation of our production. Company and third party infrastructure projects that came online in 2015 and 2016 have improved flow assurance. Future projects, such as near our Marcellus Shale assets in the Northeast, coming online in the next few years are expected to continue to enhance transportation of production to end markets.International Marketing Activities Our share of crude oil and condensate from the Aseng and Alen fields is sold at market-based prices to Glencore Energy UK Ltd (Glencore Energy) under a long-term sales contract through 2018. Our share of crude oil and condensate from the Alba field is sold to Glencore Energy under a short-term sales contract, subject to renewal. These products are transported by tanker. Natural gas from the Alba field is sold for $0.25 per MMBtu to a methanol plant, an LPG plant, an unaffiliated LNG plant and a power generation plant. The sales contract with the methanol plant runs through 2026, and the sales contract with the LNG plant runs through 2023. The methanol and LPG plants are owned by affiliated entities accounted for under the equity method. In Israel, we sell natural gas from the Tamar field, and have agreements with multiple customers to sell natural gas under long-term contracts, with initial terms ranging from 15 to 17 years. See Delivery and Firm Transportation Commitments, below. Delivery and Firm Transportation Commitments Domestic Contracts We have entered into various long-term gathering, processing and transportation contracts for some of our onshore US production, with remaining terms of one to 32 years. We use long-term contracts such as these to provide production flow assurance and ensure access to markets for our products at the best possible price and at the lowest possible logistics cost.  Certain of these contracts require us to make payments for any shortfalls in delivering or transporting minimum volumes under the commitments. As properties are undergoing development activities, we may experience temporary shortfalls until production volumes increase to meet or exceed the minimum volume commitments. For 2016, 2015, and 2014, we incurred expense of approximately $58 million, $33 million, and $16 million, respectively, related to volume deficiencies and/or unutilized commitments primarily in our onshore US operations. These amounts are recorded as marketing expense in our consolidated statements of operations.We expect to continue to incur expense related to deficiency and/or unutilized commitments in the near-term. Should commodity prices decline or if we are unable to continue to develop our properties as planned, or certain wells become uneconomic and are shut-in, we could incur additional shortfalls in delivering or transporting the minimum volumes and we could be required to make payments in the event that these commitments are not otherwise offset. We continually seek to optimize under-utilized assets through capacity release and third-party arrangements, as well as, for example, through the shifting of transportation of production from rail cars to pipelines when we receive a higher netback price. We may continue to experience these shortfalls both in the near and long-term.Our financial commitments under these contracts are included in our contractual obligations disclosures. See Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources – Contractual Obligations.Israel Natural Gas Sales and Purchase Agreements We currently sell natural gas from our Tamar field, offshore Israel, to the Israel Electric Corporation (IEC) and numerous other Israeli purchasers, including independent power producers, cogeneration facilities and industrial companies. Most contracts provide for the sale of natural gas over an initial term of 15 to 17 years. Some of the contracts provide for increase or reduction in total quantities, and some contracts are interruptible during certain contract periods. Sales prices may be based on an initial base price subject to price indexation over the life of the contract and have a contractual floor. The IEC contract provides for price reopeners in certain years with limits on the increase/decrease from the contractual price.25Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsUnder the contracts, we and our partners have a financial exposure in the event we cannot fully deliver the contract quantities. This exposure is capped by contract and will be reflected as a reduction in sales price for periods in which we are delivering partial contract quantities, or as a direct payment to the customer under certain circumstances and with a cap. The cap is subject to force majeure considerations. We believe that any such sales price adjustments or direct payments would not have a material impact on our earnings or cash flows. As of December 31, 2016, a total of approximately 5.7 Tcf, gross (1.847 Tcf, net), of natural gas remained to be delivered under the contracts. As of December 31, 2016, we have recorded 2.0 Tcf, net, of proved natural gas reserves, including proved developed reserves of 1.6 Tcf, net, and PUD reserves of 384 Bcf, net, for offshore Israel. Based on current production levels and future development plans, our available quantities of proved reserves are more than sufficient to meet near-term delivery commitments. We are also engaged in marketing activities related to the Leviathan natural gas project. See Eastern Mediterranean (Israel and Cyprus), above.Significant Purchasers Glencore Energy and Shell Trading (US) (Shell) were the largest single purchasers of our 2016 production.Glencore purchased our share of crude oil and condensate production from the Alba, Aseng and Alen fields in Equatorial Guinea. Sales to Glencore Energy accounted for 12% of 2016 total crude oil, natural gas and NGL sales, or 22% of 2016 crude oil sales. Shell purchased crude oil and condensate domestically from the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, the DJ Basin and the Marcellus Shale. Sales to Shell accounted for 13% of our 2016 total crude oil, natural gas and NGL sales, or 24% of crude oil sales.No other single purchaser accounted for 10% or more of crude oil, natural gas and NGL sales in 2016. We maintain credit insurance associated with specific purchasers and believe that the loss of any one purchaser would not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations since there are numerous potential purchasers of our production. Hedging Activities Commodity prices continue to be volatile and are affected by a variety of factors beyond our control. We use derivative instruments to reduce the impact of commodity price uncertainty and increase cash flow predictability relating to the marketing of our crude oil and natural gas. As a result of hedging, a portion of near-term cash flow volatility is reduced. We exercise strong management of our hedging program with strong oversight by our Board of Directors. For additional information, see Item 1A. Risk Factors, Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 8. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. Regulations Exploration for, and production and marketing of, crude oil, natural gas and NGLs are extensively regulated at the federal, state, and local levels in the US, and internationally. Crude oil, natural gas and NGL development and production activities are subject to various laws and regulations (and orders of regulatory bodies pursuant thereto) governing a wide variety of matters, including, among others, allowable rates of production, transportation, prevention of waste and pollution, and protection of the environment. Laws affecting the crude oil and natural gas industry are under constant review for amendment or expansion over time and frequently impose more stringent requirements on crude oil and natural gas companies. Our ability to economically produce and sell crude oil, natural gas and NGLs is affected by a number of legal and regulatory factors, including federal, state and local laws and regulations in the US and laws and regulations of foreign nations. Many of these governmental bodies have issued rules, regulations and orders that require extensive efforts to ensure compliance, that impose incremental costs to comply, and that carry substantial penalties for failure to comply. These laws, regulations and orders may restrict the rate of crude oil, natural gas and NGL production below the rate that would otherwise exist in the absence of such laws, regulations and orders. The regulatory requirements on the crude oil and natural gas industry often result in incremental costs of doing business and consequently affect our profitability. See Item 1A. Risk Factors.26Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsInternationally, our operations are subject to legal and regulatory oversight by energy-related ministries or other agencies of our host countries, each having certain relevant energy or hydrocarbons laws. Examples include: •the Ministry of Mines and Hydrocarbons, which, under such laws as the hydrocarbons law enacted in 2006 by the government of Equatorial Guinea, regulates our exploration, development and production activities offshore Equatorial Guinea;•the Ministry of National Infrastructures, Energy and Water Resources which regulates our exploration and development activities offshore Israel and the Israeli electricity market into which we sell our natural gas production;•the Israeli Antitrust Commission which reviews Israel's domestic natural gas sales and ownership in offshore blocks and leases; •the Ministry of Energy, Commerce, Industry and Tourism which regulates our exploration and development activities offshore Cyprus; and•the Department of Mineral Resources which regulates our exploration activities offshore the Falkland Islands.Examples of US federal agencies with regulatory authority over our exploration for, and production and sale of, crude oil, natural gas and NGLs include: •the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) and the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE), which under laws such as the Federal Land Policy and Management Act, Endangered Species Act, National Environmental Policy Act and Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, have certain authority over our operations on federal lands and waters, particularly in the Rocky Mountains and deepwater Gulf of Mexico;•the Office of Natural Resources Revenue, which under the Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Management Act of 1982, has certain authority over our payment of royalties, rentals, bonuses, fines, penalties, assessments, and other revenue;•the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), which under laws such as the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, and the Occupational Safety and Health Act have certain authority over environmental, health and safety matters affecting our operations;•the US Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and US National Marine Fisheries Service, which under the Endangered Species Act have authority over activities that may result in the take of any endangered or threatened species or its habitat;•the US Army Corps of Engineers, which under the Clean Water Act has authority to regulate the construction of structures involving the fill of certain waters and wetlands subject to federal jurisdiction, including well pads, pipelines and roads;•the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), which under laws such as the Energy Policy Act of 2005 has certain authority over the marketing and transportation of crude oil, natural gas and NGLs we produce onshore and from the deepwater Gulf of Mexico; and•the Department of Transportation (DOT), which has certain authority over the transportation of products, equipment and personnel necessary to our onshore US and deepwater Gulf of Mexico operations.Other US federal agencies with certain authority over our business include the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the SEC. In addition, we are governed by the rules and regulations of the NYSE, upon which shares of our common stock are traded.Among the laws affecting our operations are the following:Environmental Matters  As a developer, owner and operator of crude oil and natural gas properties, we are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign host country laws and regulations relating to the discharge of materials into, and the protection of, the environment. We must take into account the cost of complying with environmental regulations in planning, designing, drilling, operating, and abandoning wells. In most instances, the regulatory requirements relate to the handling and disposal of drilling and production wastes, water and air pollution control procedures, facility siting and construction, prevention of and responses to leaks and spills, and the remediation of petroleum-product contamination. Under state and federal laws, we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes, including wastes disposed of or released by us, or by prior owners or operators, in accordance with current laws, to suspend or cease operations in contaminated areas, or to perform remedial well plugging operations or cleanups. The EPA and various state agencies have limited the disposal options for hazardous and non-hazardous wastes and may continue to do so. The owner and operator of a site, and persons that treated, disposed of, or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances found at a site, may be liable, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. The EPA, state environmental agencies and, in some cases, third parties are authorized to take actions in response to threats to human health or the environment and to seek to recover from responsible classes of persons the costs of such action. Furthermore, certain wastes generated by our crude oil and natural gas operations that are currently exempt from the definition of hazardous waste may in the future be subject to considerably more rigorous and costly operating and disposal requirements. Under federal and state occupational safety and health laws, we must develop and maintain information about hazardous 27Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statementsmaterials used, released, or produced in our operations. Certain portions of this information must be provided to employees, state and local governmental authorities, and local citizens. We are also subject to the requirements and reporting set forth in federal workplace standards.Moreover, certain state or local laws or regulations and common law may impose liabilities in addition to, or restrictions more stringent than, those described herein.We have made and will continue to make expenditures necessary to comply with environmental requirements. We do not believe that we have, to date, expended material amounts in connection with such activities or that compliance with such requirements will have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. Although such requirements do have a substantial impact on the crude oil and natural gas industry, they do not appear to affect us to any greater or lesser extent than other companies in the industry. The following is a summary of the more significant US environmental developments and requirements that may affect our operations.Various state and federal statutes such as the Endangered Species Act (ESA) prohibit certain actions that adversely affect endangered or threatened species and their habitat, wetlands, migratory birds, marine mammals, or natural resources. Where the taking or harm of such species occurs or may occur, or where damages to wetlands or natural resources may occur, the government or private parties may act to prevent crude oil and natural gas exploration activities. In particular, a federal or state agency could order a complete halt to drilling activities in certain locations or during certain seasons when such activities could result in a serious adverse effect upon a protected species. The presence of a protected species in areas where we operate could adversely affect future production from those areas and government agencies frequently add to the lists of protected species. In January 2017, for example, the FWS announced that it was listing the Rusty Patched Bumble Bee as endangered under the ESA. Conservation measures are currently not known but could have an impact on the timing of certain of our operations in the Marcellus Shale. Listing of the Lesser Prairie Chicken likewise could impact our operations in the Permian Basin. The Lesser Prairie Chicken was removed from the ESA list of endangered species in July 2016 after a federal court invalidated the FWS’s listing of the bird as threatened because the FWS failed to give proper consideration to voluntary conservation measures; however, the FWS announced in November 2016 that it has undertaken a new status review of the Lesser Prairie Chicken to determine whether listing is still warranted. That assessment is expected to be completed in the summer of 2017.In May 2015, the US Environmental Protection Agency and the US Army Corps of Engineers jointly released a final rule that is meant to define more precisely which water bodies are and are not subject to the Clean Water Act (the Clean Water Rule). Among other things, the Clean Water Rule defines the intermittent, ephemeral, and man-altered streams to be protected and specifies when federal jurisdiction may be extended from a covered water to nearby waters. While the agencies have claimed that the new requirements are narrower than existing regulation, the Clean Water Rule has generated substantial controversy. Several court challenges have been filed, and in October 2015, the rule was stayed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, pending its review of legal challenges to the rule. To the extent that the Clean Water Rule requires more detailed studies of site conditions, or results in an expansion of federal jurisdiction over streams and wetlands, our costs may increase, especially with respect to spill prevention, storm water management, and wetlands permitting. We are continuing to monitor the challenges and to evaluate the impact of the new rule on our operations.There also have been a series of recent air regulations and proposals that affect, or that may affect, our operations. In 2012, for example, the EPA issued New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) and National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants to control air emissions associated with crude oil, natural gas and NGL production, including natural gas wells that are hydraulically fractured. In addition to addressing emissions from storage tanks and other equipment, those regulations required technologies and processes that, while reducing emissions, enable companies to collect additional natural gas that can be sold. Specifically, as of January 2015, owners and operators of natural gas wells must use emissions reduction technology called “green completions,” technologies that were already widely deployed at wells. To date, those rules have had minimal impact on our business since the reduction of GHG emissions already was one of our priorities and we had been working to improve our methods to reduce GHGs through operational and business practices. For example, we have undertaken emission reduction projects such as our US Vapor Recovery Unit (VRU) program, where we have installed VRUs to capture natural gas that would otherwise be flared on a substantial number of our tank batteries.In March 2014, the previous US Administration released a Strategy to Reduce Methane Emissions that includes consideration of both voluntary programs and targeted regulations for the oil and gas sector. Towards that end, the EPA released five draft white papers on methane emissions, volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions, and emission mitigation measures for natural gas compressors, hydraulically fractured oil wells, pneumatic devices, well liquids unloading facilities, and natural gas production and transmission facilities. After issuing a proposed rule in 2015, the EPA issued a final rule in May 2016 that sets additional standards for methane and VOC emissions from new and modified oil and gas production sources. The new rule will require operators of oil and gas properties to monitor and repair leaks, capture gas from the completion of hydraulically fractured wells, limit emissions from new and modified pneumatic pumps, and limit emissions from several types of equipment used at gas transmission compressor stations, including compressors and pneumatic controllers. An accompanying EPA rule 28Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statementswill require oil and natural gas sites within one-quarter mile to be aggregated as a single source for purposes of air permitting, which could increase our compliance costs and may require facility siting and design changes. As another prong of the previous US Administration's methane strategy, in November 2016 the BLM issued final rules for reducing venting and flaring of methane gas on public lands. The previous US Administration's goal was to reduce methane emissions from the oil and gas industry by 40-45% by 2025 as compared to 2012 levels. Challenges to the new BLM rules have been filed in federal court. It also bears noting that substantially all of our onshore US properties are subject to EPA’s requirements for reporting annual GHG emissions. Information in such reports could form the basis of further GHG regulations.In another air development, the EPA announced in October 2015 that it was lowering the primary national ambient air quality standard for ozone from 75 parts per billion to 70 parts per billion. Implementation will take place over several years; however, areas that cannot meet the new standard eventually will need to impose additional requirements on sources of VOCs and other ozone precursors which could increase the cost of siting and operating our facilities.Apart from these federal matters, most of the states where we operate have separate authority to regulate operational and environmental matters. Colorado In February 2013, the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission (COGCC) approved setback rules for crude oil and natural gas wells and production facilities located in close proximity to occupied buildings. Previously, the COGCC had allowed setback distances of 150 feet in rural areas and 350 feet in high density urban areas. These have been increased to a uniform 500 feet statewide setback from occupied buildings and 1,000 feet from high occupancy building units. The setback rules also require operators to utilize increased mitigation measures to limit potential drilling impacts to surface owners and the owners of occupied building units. In addition, the rules require advance notice to surface owners, the owners of occupied buildings and local governments prior to the filing of an Application for Permit to Drill or Oil and Gas Location Assessment as well as outreach and communication efforts by an operator. The COGCC also has implemented rules making Colorado the first state to require sampling of groundwater for hydrocarbons and other indicator compounds both before and after drilling. Those statewide rules require sampling of up to four water wells within a half mile radius of a new crude oil and natural gas well before drilling, between six and 12 months after completion, and between five and six years after completion. For the Greater Wattenberg Area, the COGCC requires operators to sample only one water well per quarter governmental section before drilling and between six to 12 months after completion. Further, the COGCC has adopted rules increasing the maximum penalty for violations of its requirements.The state environmental agency, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, likewise has adopted measures to regulate air emissions, water protection, and waste handling and disposal relating to our crude oil and natural gas exploration and production. For air, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment has extended the EPA’s emissions standards for crude oil and natural gas operations to directly control methane. The final rules, which cover the life cycle of oil and gas development, production, and maintenance, reflect a collaborative effort by the Environmental Defense Fund, Noble Energy and other oil and gas operators.Some of the counties and municipalities where we operate in Colorado have adopted their own regulations or ordinances that impose additional restrictions on our crude oil and natural gas exploration and production. To date these have not significantly impacted our operations. However, a few localities in Colorado have tried to prohibit certain exploration and production activities, particularly use of hydraulic fracturing within their boundaries. See Hydraulic Fracturing, below.In 2014, by executive order, Colorado Governor Hickenlooper created the Task Force on State and Local Regulation of Oil and Gas Operations (Task Force) for the purpose of recommending policies and legislation. The 21-member Task Force, which included a Noble Energy representative, concluded its activities on February 27, 2015. The Task Force sent nine recommendations to the Governor. The recommendations sought to balance land use issues among communities and oil and gas operators and allow reasonable access to private mineral rights. Three recommendations were approved by the legislature, and in January 2016 state regulators approved two rules addressing siting of large oil and gas operations in urban areas and coordination of drilling with local governments. We currently are evaluating the new rules. In April 2015, we entered into a joint consent decree (Consent Decree) with the EPA, US Department of Justice, and State of Colorado to improve emission control systems at a number of our condensate storage tanks that are part of our upstream oil and natural gas operations within the Non-Attainment Area of the DJ Basin. The Consent Decree was entered by the US District Court of Colorado on June 2, 2015 and requires us to perform certain activities. All fines required under the Consent Decree were paid in 2015; however, the required injunctive relief remains ongoing. Based on currently available information, we have concluded that the remaining obligations will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. See Item 1A. Risk Factors – Our operations require us to comply with a number of US and international laws and regulations, violations of which could result in substantial fines or sanctions and/or impair our ability to do business and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 18. Commitments and Contingencies. Pennsylvania Pennsylvania's Act 13 of 2012 (Act 13) represented the first comprehensive legislation regarding the development of the Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania. Act 13, among other things, enacted stronger environmental standards; 29Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statementsestablished impact fees, which are set based on a multi-year fee schedule and the average sales price of natural gas; increased the notice distance for unconventional well permit applications from 1,000 feet to 3,000 feet; extended the setback distance for unconventional wells from 200 feet to 500 feet; and increased the distance and duration of presumed liability for water pollution to 2,500 feet from a well site and twelve months after well drilling, completion, stimulation or alteration. In addition, Act 13 imposed spill prevention requirements applicable to well site construction, wastewater transportation, and gathering lines. Act 13 has been the subject of multiple challenges in the Pennsylvania courts. In 2013 for example, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court invalidated the portions of Act 13 providing for statewide zoning and state waivers of the setback requirements in Pennsylvania's Oil and Gas Act. In 2014, moreover, the Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court invalidated Act 13’s provisions allowing the state to review local drilling rules. These court decisions have the effect of giving local communities in Pennsylvania more authority to regulate oil and gas operations, which could make it more difficult to develop our Marcellus Shale acreage in some municipalities. Furthermore, the state has finalized new rules for surface operations at oil and gas sites that, among other things, would increase public participation in the permitting process, increase mitigation obligations and require surveys for abandoned wells. On October 8, 2016, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection issued the final rule amending Pennsylvania Code Chapter 78a revising requirements for surface activities related to unconventional oil and gas operations. The final rule increases requirements for permitting, waste handling, water management and restoration, surface reclamation, and requirements related to abandoned and orphaned wells. In November 2016, a Pennsylvania state court issued an opinion requiring the enforcement of certain portions of the new rule while the court considers legal challenges to the rule brought by an industry group. These regulations may increase operating costs and cause delays. Texas Texas has regulations governing conservation matters, including provisions for the unitization or pooling of oil and gas properties, the establishment of maximum rates of production from oil and gas wells, the regulation of spacing, and requirements for plugging and abandonment of wells. In May 2013, the Texas Railroad Commission (RRC) issued an updated “well integrity rule” that addresses requirements for drilling, casing and cementing wells. The rule also includes new testing and reporting requirements, including clarifying that cementing reports must be submitted after well completion or after cessation of drilling, whichever is earlier.In October 2014, the RRC adopted new permit rules for injection wells to address seismic activity concerns within the state. Among other things, the rules require companies seeking permits for disposal wells to provide seismic activity data in permit applications, provide for more frequent monitoring and reporting for certain wells, and allow the RRC to modify, suspend, or terminate permits on grounds that a disposal well is likely to be, or determined to be, causing seismic activity.Other US Environmental Requirements In addition to the above, we will continue to monitor proposed and new legislation and regulations in all our operating jurisdictions to assess the potential impact on the Company. We continue to engage in extensive public education and outreach efforts with the goal of engaging and educating the general public and communities about the energy, economic and environmental benefits of safe and responsible crude oil and natural gas development. US Offshore Regulatory Developments  In April 2016, the BSEE issued a final rule entitled “Oil and Gas and Sulfur Operations in the Outer Continental Shelf - Blowout Preventer Systems and Well Control,” which updates standards for blowout prevention systems and other well controls for offshore oil and gas activities conducted in US federal waters, including the Gulf of Mexico. Although the final rule incorporates some of the changes recommended by the oil and gas industry, it imposes a number of new requirements relating to well design, well control, casing, cementing, real-time well monitoring and subsea containment. For example, the new rule requires double sets of shear rams on all deepwater blowout preventers (BOPs), periodic inspections of BOPs and outside audits of equipment, and real-time well monitoring requirements. The new rule will likely increase the costs associated with well design, drilling and completion operations, as well as ongoing monitoring costs for our wells in the Gulf of Mexico. The final rule went into effect on July 28, 2016.On March 17, 2016, the BOEM proposed a new air quality rule that would significantly broaden the obligations of operators and lessees in the Outer Continental Shelf, including the Gulf of Mexico, to assess, report and, when appropriate, control emissions. Among other items, the proposed rule would expand the types of emissions that must be measured, change the boundary for evaluating air emissions, and increase the scope of sources that must be addressed. If adopted as proposed, the new rule would likely increase the cost associated with our activities in the Gulf of Mexico. The comment period for the proposed rule expired June 20, 2016.Additionally, the BOEM recently updated its regulations and program oversight to establish more robust risk management, financial assurance and loss prevention requirements for oil and gas operations in the Outer Continental Shelf, including the Gulf of Mexico. On July 14, 2016, the BOEM issued an updated Notice to Lessees and Operators (NTL) providing details on revised procedures the agency will be using to determine a lessee’s or operator's ability to carry out decommissioning obligations for activities in the Outer Continental Shelf, including the Gulf of Mexico. This revised policy institutes new criteria by which the BOEM will evaluate 30Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statementsthe financial strength and reliability of lessees and operators active in the Outer Continental Shelf. If the BOEM determines under the revised policy that a lessee or operator does not have the financial ability to meet its decommissioning and other obligations, that lessee or operator will be required to post additional financial security as assurance. The revised policy originally became effective September 12, 2016; however, the BOEM is extending the implementation timeline for six months in certain circumstances. We estimated the impact of the new financial criteria on our operations in the Gulf of Mexico and do not believe that the revised policy will have a material impact on our operations in the Gulf of Mexico, or on our financial position or cash flows.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is proposing to expand the boundaries of the Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary in the Gulf of Mexico. NOAA released its draft environmental impact statement (DEIS) on the proposed expansion in June 2016, in which it proposed five alternatives for expanding existing sanctuary regulations to new geographic areas. Two of these alternatives for sanctuary expansion have the potential to impact certain of our leases which could increase drilling, operating and decommissioning costs. The comment period for the expansion alternatives outlined in the DEIS expired on August 19, 2016. We are currently evaluating the expansion alternatives and assessing any potential impact on our operations in the Gulf of Mexico.See Item 1A. Risk Factors – We are subject to increasing governmental regulations and environmental requirements that may cause us to incur substantial incremental costs.Israel's Natural Gas Policy and Antitrust Authority The Israel Natural Gas Framework, as adopted by the Government of Israel, provides clarity on numerous matters concerning resource development, including certain fiscal, antitrust and other regulatory matters, which we will rely upon to support a final investment decision and proceed with the development of these resources while ensuring economic benefits to the state of Israel and its citizens. The Framework provides for the reduction of our ownership interest in Tamar to 25% by year-end 2021, while enabling the marketing of Leviathan natural gas to Israeli customers. In second quarter 2016, the Government of Israel adopted a new economic stability clause which does not remove the possibility of future adverse legislation but does provide for project economic stability in the event of certain future adverse actions. Impact of Dodd-Frank Act Section 1504 On June 27, 2016, the SEC adopted resource extraction issuer payment disclosure rules under Section 1504 of the Dodd-Frank Act that will require resource extraction companies, such as us, to publicly file with the SEC information about the type and total amount of payments made to a foreign government, including subnational governments (such as states and/or counties), or the U.S. federal government for each project related to the commercial development of crude oil, natural gas or minerals, and the type and total amount of payments made to each government. Reporting and disclosure will be required annually beginning with the 2018 fiscal year.Hydraulic Fracturing Concerns The practice of hydraulic fracturing, especially the hydraulic fracturing processes associated with drilling in shale formations, is the subject of significant focus among some environmentalists and regulators. Concerns over potential hazards associated with the use of hydraulic fracturing and its impact on the environment and, potentially, the general public health, have been raised at local, state and federal levels of government in the US and internationally. Hydraulic fracturing requires the use and disposal of water, and public concern has been growing over its possible effects on drinking water supplies, as well as the adequacy of both water supply sources and disposal methods. Our Operations Hydraulic fracturing techniques have been used by the industry since 1947, and, currently, more than 90% of all crude oil and natural gas wells drilled in the US employ hydraulic fracturing. The process involves the injection of water, sand and chemical additives under pressure into targeted subsurface formations to stimulate oil and gas production. We strive to adopt best practices and industry standards and comply with all regulatory requirements regarding well construction and operation. For example, the qualified service companies we use to perform hydraulic fracturing, as well as our personnel, monitor rate and pressure to assure that the services are performed as planned. Our well construction practices include installation of multiple layers of protective steel casing surrounded by cement that are specifically designed and installed to protect freshwater aquifers by preventing the migration of fracturing fluids into those aquifers. Where possible, we strive to procure non-hydrologic water (water that is not connected to a natural surface stream) for use in hydraulic fracturing; a large proportion of our water is from non-tributary sources, such as deep ground water. In the DJ Basin, we are in the process of securing additional water rights in support of our drilling program, and we engage in significant water recycling efforts in both the DJ Basin and Marcellus Shale. We believe that these processes help ensure hydraulic fracturing is safe and does not and will not pose a risk to water supplies, the environment or public health. Studies and Potential Rulemaking  Although hydraulic fracturing is regulated primarily at the state level, governments and agencies at all levels from federal to municipal are studying it and evaluating the need for further requirements. For example, in 2011, the US Secretary of Energy formed the Shale Gas Production Subcommittee (Subcommittee), a subcommittee of the Secretary of Energy Advisory Board. The Subcommittee issued final recommendations in November 2011 that included better communications with the public, better air quality controls, protection of water supply and quality, disclosure of fracturing fluid 31Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statementscomposition, reduction of diesel fuel use, continuous development of best practices, and federal sponsorship of research and development with respect to unconventional gas. In addition, the US Department of Energy's National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) is conducting a comprehensive assessment of the environmental effects of shale gas production at two industry-provided Marcellus Shale test sites in southwestern Pennsylvania. Goals include:•documentation of environmental changes that are coincident with shale gas production;•development of technology or management practices that mitigate any unintended environmental changes; and•development of monitoring technologies to (1) assess the impact of shale gas production on air quality and (2) determine if zonal isolation between producing formations and drinking water aquifers is maintained after hydraulic fracturing.We are monitoring the results of the NETL study in order to assess any potential impact to our onshore US development programs.In June 2015, moreover, the US EPA issued its draft “Assessment of the Potential Impacts of Hydraulic Fracturing for Oil and Gas on Drinking Water Resources.” At a high level, the agency states, “[it] did not find evidence that hydraulic fracturing mechanisms have led to widespread, systemic impacts on drinking water resources in the United States.” The agency’s Science Advisory Board (SAB) commented, however, that the agency’s conclusions do not clearly describe the systems of interest (e.g., groundwater, surface water) nor the definitions of “systemic,” “widespread,” or “impacts.” The SAB also raised a concern that the agency’s conclusions do not reflect “the uncertainties and data limitations described in the body of the Report associated with such impacts.” As a result, the EPA issued a final report concluding that fracturing “activities can impact drinking water resources under some circumstances.” Among these are spills, leaks from pits, injection “into wells with inadequate mechanical integrity” and injection “directly into groundwater resources.” The EPA also found “significant data gaps and uncertainties in the available data.” We are monitoring whether the EPA’s revised conclusions generate further agency activities. Also on the regulatory front, the US BLM issued proposed regulations in 2012 for hydraulic fracturing on federal lands, which were withdrawn and then reissued on May 16, 2013. BLM's rules would affect drilling operations on the 700 million acres of federally-owned minerals administered by the BLM, as well as 56 million acres of Native American-owned minerals. A final rule was released in March 2015, and was immediately challenged in U.S. district court in Wyoming. The judge struck down the rule in July 2016, finding the BLM lacked statutory authority to promulgate the new regulations. The agency has appealed that ruling, with opening arguments to begin in March 2017.Apart from its air regulations for newly fractured natural gas wells (see Regulations), the EPA developed new guidelines under the Safe Drinking Water Act regarding the issuance of permits for the use of diesel fuel as a component in hydraulic fracturing activities. The guidance outlines for EPA permit writers, where EPA is the permitting authority, requirements for diesel fuels used for hydraulic fracturing of wells, technical recommendations for permitting those wells, and a description of diesel fuels subject to EPA underground injection control permitting. Beyond that, the agency has solicited public comment on information reporting and disclosure for hydraulic fracturing. The EPA also has developed a rule addressing discharges of hydraulic fracturing wastewaters from oil and gas extraction facilities to public treatment works. In December 2016, the EPA extended the compliance deadline until August 2019.In June 2012, OSHA and the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) issued a joint hazard alert for workers who use silica (sand) in hydraulic fracturing activities. The following year saw the agency formally propose to lower the permissible exposure limit for airborne silica. In 2016, OSHA finalized a lower exposure limit for silica along with stricter silica work practices. For hydraulic fracturing, the new obligations start to take effect in 2018. OSHA also has prepared guidance identifying additional workplace hazards resulting from hydraulic fracturing and ways to reduce exposure to those hazards. To date, hydraulic fracturing has been regulated primarily at the state level, and all of the states where our US onshore operations are located (including Colorado, Texas, West Virginia, and Pennsylvania) have developed such requirements. See Regulations. Beginning in 2012, a number of local communities in Colorado became interested in increasing regulatory requirements on oil and gas development. Ballot measures supporting restrictions or bans on the practice of hydraulic fracturing within their boundaries were passed in several municipalities. Challenges were brought against each of these bans in state district court and, in May 2016, the Colorado Supreme Court found that the local laws in question were preempted by existing state law and were therefore invalid. In the future, however, should additional statewide or local Colorado initiatives be undertaken to regulate, limit or ban hydraulic fracturing or other facets of crude oil and natural gas exploration, development or operations, our business could be impacted, resulting in delay or inability to develop oil and gas reserves, reducing our long-term reserves, production and cash flow growth, and potentially having a negative impact on our stock price. 32Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsState and federal regulatory agencies recently have focused on a possible connection between the operation of injection wells used for oil and gas waste disposal and seismic activity, which some have termed "induced seismicity." In a few instances, operators of injection wells in the vicinity of seismic events have been ordered to reduce injection volumes or suspend operations. Some state regulatory agencies have modified their regulations to account for induced seismicity with regard to the operation of injection wells used for oil and gas waste disposal. Increased regulation and attention given to induced seismicity could lead to greater opposition, including litigation, to oil and gas activities utilizing injection wells for waste disposal. In the states where we operate, the regulatory agencies are evaluating possible modifications to the regulations of wastewater disposal through injection wells due to the potential for induced seismicity; however, there has not been any finalization or implementation of new regulations around this topic.Public Disclosure Several states have issued regulations requiring disclosure of certain information regarding the components used in the hydraulic-fracturing process. In 2011, for example, the RRC adopted the Hydraulic Fracturing Chemical Disclosure rule, which requires companies to disclose, on a public registry, chemical ingredients used to hydraulically fracture wells in Texas. The registry, FracFocus.org, is operated jointly by the Interstate Oil & Gas Compact Commission and the Ground Water Protection Council. In December 2011, the COGCC adopted hydraulic fracturing fluid ingredient regulations requiring disclosure of all chemicals and establishing ways to protect proprietary information. The regulations allow disclosure through the FracFocus web site. The State of Wyoming also requires disclosure of the types and amounts of fracturing chemicals. In 2012, through Act 13, Pennsylvania established a requirement that operators submit information regarding hydraulic fracturing chemicals to FracFocus.org. Other states have proposed, or are considering, similar regulations which require specific disclosures by operators and/or outline requirements for construction and operation of wells and monitoring of well activity. We are currently providing disclosure information on FracFocus.org for all onshore US areas in which we operate. Additional Information See: •Items 1. and 2.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources – Risk and Insurance Program.Undeveloped Oil and Gas LeasesOil and gas exploration is a lengthy process of obtaining data, evaluating, and de-risking prospects, and it takes time to develop resources in a responsible manner. The period of time from lease acquisition to discovery can take many years of ongoing effort. We begin by leasing acreage (or deepwater lease blocks) from individuals, other operators or the host government. It may take years for us to assemble sufficient acreage to cover the areal extent of a prospect that we wish to explore. Once the acreage position is assembled, we obtain seismic data either through purchase of available data or by contracting for seismic services. Our exploration staff then begin a lengthy process of analyzing the seismic and other data in order to identify a potential optimal location for drilling an initial exploratory well. Once we decide to drill an exploratory well, we must obtain permits and contract a drilling rig with the specifications for the depth and well pressures which we expect to drill. If there is a discovery, we may need to obtain additional data and/or drill appraisal wells in order to estimate the extent of the reservoir and the volume of resources that could potentially be recovered. Appraisal or development drilling requires additional time to contract for an appropriate drilling rig, and obtain pipe, other equipment, and supplies. Competition The crude oil and natural gas industry is highly competitive. We encounter competition from other crude oil and natural gas companies in all areas of operations, including the acquisition of seismic data and lease rights on crude oil and natural gas properties and for the labor and equipment required for exploration and development of those properties. Our competitors include major integrated crude oil and natural gas companies, state-controlled national oil companies, independent crude oil and natural gas companies, service companies engaging in exploration and production activities, drilling partnership programs, private equity, and individuals. Many of our competitors are large, well-established companies. Such companies may be able to pay more for seismic information and lease rights on crude oil and natural gas properties and exploratory prospects and to define, evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit. Our ability to acquire additional properties and to discover reserves in the future will be dependent upon our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment. See Item 1A. Risk Factors.Geographical DataWe have operations throughout the world and manage our operations by region. Information is grouped into four components that are all in the business of crude oil, natural gas and NGL exploration, development and production: United States, Eastern Mediterranean, West Africa and Other International and Corporate. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 15. Segment Information. Employees As of December 31, 2016, we had 2,274 full-time employees. Offices Our principal corporate office is located at 1001 Noble Energy Way, Houston, Texas, 77070. We maintain additional regional exploration and/or production offices primarily in Denver, Colorado; Greeley, Colorado; Pecos, Texas; Dilley, Texas; Canonsburg, Pennsylvania; and in Israel, Cyprus, Equatorial Guinea, and Cameroon. Title to Properties We believe that our title to the various interests set forth above is satisfactory and consistent with generally accepted industry standards, subject to exceptions that would not materially detract from the value of the interests or materially interfere with their use in our operations. Individual properties may be subject to burdens such as royalty, overriding royalty and other outstanding interests customary in the industry. In addition, interests may be subject to obligations or duties under applicable laws or burdens such as production payments, net profits interest, liens incident to operating agreements and for current taxes, development obligations under crude oil and natural gas leases or capital commitments under PSCs or exploration licenses. We have also dedicated certain of our onshore US acreage to Noble Midstream Partners for the provision of midstream services to us.Furthermore, while the majority of our assets are held by production, certain of our assets, such as our Eagle Ford Shale and Permian Basin properties, are held through continuous development obligations. Therefore, we are contractually obligated to fund a level of development activity in these areas and failure to meet these obligations may result in the loss of a lease. Title Defects Subsequent to a lease or fee interest acquisition transaction, the buyer usually has a period of time in which to examine the leases for title defects. Adjustments for title defects are generally made within the terms of the sales agreement, which may provide for arbitration between the buyer and seller. Conflicts with Surface Rights Mineral rights are property rights that include the right to use land surface that is reasonably necessary to access minerals beneath. Lawsuits regarding conflicts between surface rights and mineral rights are currently pending in several states. In several cases, owners of surface rights are suing various companies to prevent companies from using their land surface to drill horizontal wells to explore for or produce natural gas from neighboring mineral tracts. If a plaintiff were to prevail in such a case, it could become more difficult and expensive for a company to place multi-acre well pads and/or limit the length of horizontal wells drilled from a pad.Available InformationOur website address is www.nobleenergyinc.com.

Risk FactorsDescribed below are certain risks that we believe are applicable to our business and the oil and gas industry in which we operate. There may be additional risks that are not presently material or known. You should carefully consider each of the following risks and all other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If any of the events described below occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity or access to the capital markets could be materially adversely affected. In addition, the current global economic and political environment intensifies many of these risks. 33Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsThe oil and gas industry is cyclical and an extended period of suppressed commodity prices could have material adverse effects on our operations, our liquidity, and the price of our common stock.Our ability to operate profitably, maintain adequate liquidity, grow our business and pay dividends on our common stock depend upon the prices we receive for our crude oil, natural gas, and NGL production. Commodity prices are cyclical and subject to supply and demand dynamics. For the past two years, following the significant decline that began in late 2014, crude oil prices, in particular, have been trading in a much lower range. While, in the second half of 2016, we witnessed a certain degree of commodity price improvement, we expect that economic, geopolitical, and supply and demand forces will remain volatile. As a result we may continue to operate in a soft market, with sustained lower commodity prices, subject to further decline if the excess of supply over demand increases.Average commodity prices for 2016 fell below the already suppressed 2015 average prices, and, thus, continued to negatively impact our revenues, operating cash flows and profitability and adversely affected the price of our common stock. If commodity prices continue to trade at low or lower levels for an extended period, one or more of the following could occur:•further significant reductions of our revenues, profit margins, operating income and cash flows;•reduction in the amount of crude oil, natural gas and NGLs that we can produce economically, leading to shut-in or early abandonment of producing wells and increased capital requirements for abandonment operations;•certain properties in our portfolio becoming economically unviable;•additional impairments of proved or unproved properties or other long-lived assets;•loss of undeveloped acreage if our production is shut-in or we are unable to make scheduled delay rental payments;•use of cash flow to satisfy minimum obligations under throughput agreements if production is suspended;•reduction, or suspension, of our 2017 capital investment program, or significant reductions in future capital investment programs, resulting in a reduced ability to develop our reserves;•delay, postponement or cancellation of some of our exploration or development projects;•inability to meet exploration commitments, leading to loss of leases or exploration rights;•divestments of properties to generate funds to meet cash flow or liquidity requirements;•limitations on our financial condition, liquidity, and/or ability to finance planned capital expenditures and operations; •inability to meet scheduled interest and/or debt payments or payments due under operating or capital leases;•a series of credit rating downgrades or other negative rating actions could increase our cost of financing, and may increase our requirements to post collateral as financial assurance of performance under certain other contracts which, in turn, could have a negative impact on our liquidity;•changes in corporate structure that could lead to loss of key personnel and interrupt our business activities;•limitations on our access to sources of capital, such as debt and equity; and•reduction or suspension of dividends on our common stock.In addition, lower commodity prices, including declines in commodity forward price curves, may result in the following:•declines in our stock price; and•additional counterparty credit risk exposure on commodity hedges and joint venture receivables.Our hedging arrangements in place will not fully mitigate the effects of commodity price volatility. Furthermore, in the current commodity price environment, we are less likely to hedge future revenues to the same extent as our historical and existing hedging arrangements. As such, our revenues will be more susceptible to commodity price volatility as our commodity price hedges settle and are not replaced. Furthermore, certain crude oil demand estimates suggest a hypothetical point in the future when global oil demand reaches its peak demand level. The International Energy Agency's 450 Scenario sets out an energy pathway consistent with the goal of limiting the global increase in temperature to 2°C by limiting concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere to around 450 parts per million of CO2. Under this scenario, global oil demand peaks by 2020, and the subsequent decline in demand accelerates year-on-year, so that by the late 2020s global demand is falling by over one million barrels per day every year. This decline in demand, if it occurs, would negatively impact commodity prices as well as our ability to explore for and develop our crude oil and natural gas resources.Markets and prices for crude oil, natural gas and NGLs depend on factors beyond our control, factors including, among others:•global demand for crude oil, natural gas and NGLs as impacted by economic factors that affect gross domestic product growth rates of countries around the world; •global supply for crude oil, natural gas and NGLs as impacted by OPEC and Non-OPEC countries (e.g. US, Russia, Canada); •technology advances that increase crude oil, natural gas and NGL production;•new technologies that promote fuel efficiency and reduce energy consumption;•developments in the global liquified natural gas (LNG) market, including exports from the US;34Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements•geopolitical conditions and events, including generational leadership or regime changes, changes in government energy policies, including imposed price controls and/or product subsidies, or instability/armed conflict in hydrocarbon-producing regions;•fluctuations in US dollar exchange rates, the currency in which the world's crude oil trade is generally denominated;•the price and availability of alternative fuels, including coal, solar, wind, nuclear energy and biofuels;•the long-term impact on the crude oil market of the use of natural gas as an alternative fuel for road transportation;•the availability of pipeline capacity/infrastructure as well as refining capacity;•the level and effect of trading in commodity futures markets, including by commodity price speculators and others;•the effectiveness of worldwide conservation measures;•weather conditions;•demand for electricity as well as natural gas used as fuel for electricity generation; •fuel efficiency regulations, such as the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards, and its impacts on crude oil demand as a transportation fuel;•access to government-owned and other lands for exploration and production activities; and•domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes.Sector cost inflation could adversely affect our ability to execute our exploration and development plans on a timely basis and within our budget.Our industry is cyclical and third party oilfield materials, service and supply costs are also subject to supply and demand dynamics. During periods of decreasing levels of industry exploration and production, such as occurred in 2015 and 2016, the demand for, and cost of, drilling rigs and oilfield services decreases. Conversely, during periods of increasing levels of industry activity, the demand for, and cost of, drilling rigs and oilfield services increases. In the second half of 2016, we witnessed a modest improvement in commodity prices. If this trend continues, and if the commodity price recovery is robust, we expect industry exploration and production activities to increase, resulting in higher demand for oilfield services and supplies, which could result in sector price inflation. In addition, the costs of such items could increase and their availability may become limited, particularly in basins of relatively higher activity.In addition, regulatory changes, such as those related to hydraulic fracturing or water disposal, may also result in reduced availability and/or higher costs for rigs and services. As a result, drilling rigs and oilfield services may not be available at rates that provide a satisfactory return on our investment. Our Eastern Mediterranean discoveries bear certain geopolitical, regulatory, financial and technical challenges that could adversely impact our ability to monetize our Israel and Cyprus natural gas assets. We have entered into and are currently negotiating various long-term GSPAs for our Eastern Mediterranean natural gas assets. Some of these agreements would require the export of natural gas from either Israel or Cyprus to other countries in the region, such as Egypt and Jordan. These agreements are subject to a variety of risks, including geopolitical, regulatory, financial and other uncertainties. War, political violence, civil unrest or lack of intergovernmental cooperation could affect both our and our counterparties’ abilities to cooperate and to perform under these agreements, and could potentially lead to a breach or termination of such agreements. In addition, economic conditions or financial duress of our counterparties could jeopardize their ability to fulfill their payment obligations under these contracts. Furthermore, if material disruptions occur, including events or circumstances constituting force majeure under contract provisions, such that they inhibit us or our counterparties from performing under these GSPAs, or our counterparties are unable to pay us for a sustained period of time, we could incur significant financial losses. We are subject to certain regulatory provisions under the Israel Natural Gas Framework, as adopted by the Government of Israel, including a requirement to reduce our ownership in Tamar to 25% by the end of 2021. Our inability to sell-down interest at competitive market terms or to reduce our ownership to 25% within the time period required by the Framework, could result in a loss of proceeds due to selling our ownership at less than satisfactory terms. In addition, changes in Israel's fiscal, and/or regulatory regimes or energy policies occurring as a result of government policy on natural gas development and/or exports could: •delay or reduce the profitability of our Tamar and/or Leviathan development projects; •delay or preclude closing of financing arrangements for our partners; and/or •render future exploration and development projects uneconomic. Each of our development options requires a multi-billion dollar investment and will take several years to complete. Failure of our partners to obtain financing on acceptable terms could result in a delay in these development projects. 35Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsDue to the scale of our Leviathan and Cyprus discoveries, realization of their full economic value depends on our ability to execute successful development scenarios for Leviathan and Aphrodite, the failure of which could reduce our future growth and have negative effects on our future operating results. Offshore projects of this magnitude entail significant technical complexities including subsea tiebacks to a FPSO or production platform, pressure maintenance systems, gas re-injection systems, onshore receiving terminals, or other specialized infrastructure. In addition, we depend on third-party technology and service providers and other supply chain participants for these complex projects. Delays and differences between estimated and actual timing of critical events related to these projects could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Failure of our partners to fund their share of development costs or obtain financing could result in delay or cancellation of future projects, thus limiting our growth and future cash flows.Some of our major development projects entail significant capital expenditures and have long development cycle times. For example, in the Eastern Mediterranean, each of our natural gas development options requires a multi-billion dollar investment and spans multiple years from project sanction to production.As a result, our partners must be able to fund their share of investment costs through the development cycle, through cash flow from operations, external credit facilities, or other sources, including financing arrangements. Our partners are as susceptible to certain of the risk factors captured under Item 1A as we are, including, but not limited to, commodity price declines, fiscal regime changes, government project approval delays, regulatory changes, credit downgrades and regional conflict. If one or more of these factors negatively impacts our project partners' cash flows or ability to obtain adequate financing, it could result in a delay or cancellation of a project, resulting in a reduction of our reserves and production, negatively impacting the timing and receipt of planned cash flows and expected profitability.Our international operations may be adversely affected by economic and geopolitical developments.We have significant international operations, with approximately 27% of our 2016 total consolidated sales volumes coming from our international operations in Israel and Equatorial Guinea. We also conduct exploration activities in international areas. Our operations may be adversely affected by political and economic developments, including the following:•renegotiation, modification or nullification of existing contracts, such as may occur pursuant to future regulations enacted as a result of changes in Israel's antitrust, export and natural gas development policies, or the hydrocarbons law enacted in 2006 by the government of Equatorial Guinea, which can result in an increase in the amount of revenues that the host government receives from production (government take) or otherwise decrease project profitability;•loss of revenue, property and equipment as a result of actions taken by host nations, such as expropriation or nationalization of assets or termination of contracts; •disruptions caused by territorial or boundary disputes in certain international regions; •changes in drilling or safety regulations in other countries;•laws and policies of the US and foreign jurisdictions affecting trade, foreign investment, taxation and business conduct;•potential for Israel natural gas production and regional exports to be interrupted by political conditions and events, and regional instability or armed conflict in the region;•difficulties enforcing our rights against a governmental agency because of the doctrine of sovereign immunity and foreign sovereignty over international operations;•foreign exchange or repatriation restrictions;•war, piracy, acts of terrorism or civil unrest;•US and international monetary policies causing changes in the relative value of the US dollar as compared with the currencies of other countries in which we conduct business; and•other hazards arising out of foreign governmental sovereignty over areas in which we conduct operations.Such political and economic developments as mentioned above could have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows and reduce the fair values of our properties, resulting in impairment charges. Our operations may be adversely affected by changes in the fiscal regimes and related government policies and regulations in the countries in which we operate.Fiscal regimes impact oil and gas companies through laws and regulations governing resource access along with government participation in oil and gas projects, royalties and taxes. We operate in the US and other countries whose fiscal regimes may change over time. Changes in fiscal regimes result in an increase or decrease in the amount of government financial take from developments, and a corresponding decrease or increase in the revenues of an oil and gas company operating in that particular country. For example, a significant portion of our production comes from Israel and Equatorial Guinea; therefore, changes in or uncertainties related to the fiscal regimes of these countries could have a significant impact on our operations and financial 36Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statementsperformance. Further, we cannot predict how government agencies or courts will interpret existing regulations and tax laws or the effect such interpretations could have on our business.Many governments globally are seeking additional revenue sources, including, potentially, increases in government financial take from oil and gas projects. In developing nations, governments may seek additional revenues to support infrastructure and economic development and for social spending. In many nations of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), governments continue to incur significant budget deficits and growing national debt levels, as well as pressure from financial markets to address structural spending imbalances. The OECD itself issued guidance reports in October 2015 on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS), an initiative which aims to standardize and modernize global tax policy and disclosure of financial and operational data with tax authorities. Adoption of BEPS's recommendations is widely expected by the majority of the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate and this could result in changes to tax policies, including transfer pricing policies. To the extent such changes significantly increase the overall tax imposed on currently producing projects, these projects could become less economic, or wholly uneconomic, thereby reducing the amount of proved reserves we record and cash flows we receive, and possibly resulting in asset impairment charges. In the US, certain measures have been proposed that would alter current tax expense on oil and gas companies, for example: the repeal of percentage depletion for oil and natural gas properties; the deferral of expensing intangible drilling and development costs (IDC); the inability to expense costs of certain domestic production activities; and a lengthening of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures. It is likely that some of these proposals to increase tax expense on the oil and gas industry will continue to be reviewed by the US Congress in future years. The enactment of some or all of these proposals could have a significant negative impact on our capital investment, production and growth. Changes in fiscal regimes have long-term impacts on our business strategy, and fiscal uncertainty makes it difficult to formulate and execute capital investment programs. The implementation of new, or the modification of existing, laws or regulations increasing the tax costs on our business could disrupt our business plans and negatively impact our operations and our stock price in the following ways, among others: •restrict resource access or investment in lease holdings;•limit exploration activities, which could have a long-term negative impact on the quantities of proved reserves we record and inhibit future production growth; •have a negative impact on the ability of us and/or our partners to obtain financing;•cause delay in or cancellation of development plans, which could also have a long-term negative impact on the quantities of proved reserves we record and inhibit future production growth;•reduce the profitability of our projects, resulting in decreases in net income and cash flows with the potential to make future investments uneconomical;•result in currently producing projects becoming uneconomic, to the extent fiscal changes are retroactive, thereby reducing the amount of proved reserves we record and cash flows we receive, and possibly resulting in asset impairment charges;•require that valuation allowances be established against deferred tax assets, with offsetting increases in income tax expense, resulting in decreases in net income and cash flow;•restrict our ability to compete with imported volumes of crude oil or natural gas; and/or•adversely affect the price of our common stock.Concentration of capital, production and cash flows from certain operations may increase our exposure of risks enumerated herein.A significant portion of our production and revenue is highly concentrated and is generated from certain conventional deepwater fields. These fields, located in the Gulf of Mexico, offshore Eastern Mediterranean and offshore West Africa, contributed approximately 41% of our 2016 total consolidated revenues and 34% of our 2016 sales volumes, respectively, and are capital and resource-intensive. Although we carry contingent business interruption insurance in these areas, a disruption to downstream operations impacting the processing, marketing and distribution of our production, such as from an accident, natural disaster, government intervention or other event, would have a significant impact on our production profile, cash flows, profitability, and overall business plan. We also have significant concentrations of capital and production in unconventional basins including the DJ Basin, Permian Basin, Eagle Ford Shale and Marcellus Shale, and we expect to invest approximately $1.8 billion, or 75%, of our total capital investment program to development activities in these areas. Restrictions in land access, rapid changes in drilling and completion technology, lack of availability of downstream services, changes in regulations and other risks impacting these 37Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statementsareas, as enumerated in the accompanying Risk Factors, can have immediate, significant negative impacts on our production, cash flows, profitability and financial position.Our operations may be adversely affected by violent acts such as from civil disturbances, terrorist acts, regime changes, cross-border violence, war, piracy, or other conflicts that may occur in regions that encompass our operations.Violent acts resulting in loss of life, destruction of property, environmental damage and pollution occur around the world. Many incidents are driven by civil, ethnic, religious or economic strife. In addition, the number of incidents attributed to various terrorist or extremist organizations has increased significantly. Certain countries within the Middle East, including Syria, Libya, Iraq and Yemen, continue to experience varying degrees of political instability, public protests and terrorist attacks. We operate in regions of the world that have experienced such incidents or are in close proximity to areas where violence has occurred. Terrorist attacks and the threat of terrorist attacks, whether domestic or foreign, as well as military or other actions taken in response to these acts, could cause instability in the global financial and energy markets. Continued or escalated civil and political unrest and acts of terrorism in the regions in which we operate could result in our curtailing operations. In the event that regions in which we operate experience civil or political unrest or acts of terrorism, especially in areas where such unrest leads to regime change, our operations in such regions could be materially impaired. We monitor the economic and political environments of the countries in which we operate. However, we are unable to predict the occurrence of disturbances such as those noted above. In addition, we have limited ability to mitigate their impact. Civil disturbances, terrorist acts, regime changes, war, or conflicts, or the threats thereof, could have the following results, among others: •increased volatility in global crude oil, natural gas and NGL prices which could negatively impact the global economy, resulting in slower economic growth rates, which could reduce demand for our products;•negative impact on the world crude oil supply if infrastructure or transportation are disrupted, leading to further commodity price volatility; •difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified personnel to work in areas with potential for conflict;•inability of our personnel or supplies to enter or exit the countries where we are conducting operations;•disruption of our operations due to evacuation of personnel;•inability to deliver our production due to disruption or closing of transportation routes;•reduced ability to export our production due to efforts of countries to conserve domestic resources;•damage to or destruction of our wells, production facilities, receiving terminals or other operating assets;•damage to or destruction of property belonging to our natural gas purchasers leading to interruption of natural gas deliveries, claims of force majeure, and/or termination of natural gas sales contracts, resulting in a reduction in our revenues;•inability of our service and equipment providers to deliver items necessary for us to conduct our operations;•lack of availability of drilling rig, oilfield equipment or services if third party providers decide to exit the region;•shutdown of a financial system, communications network, or power grid causing a disruption to our business activities; and•capital market reassessment of risk and reduction of available capital making it more difficult for us and our partners to obtain financing for potential development projects.Loss of property and/or interruption of our business plans resulting from civil unrest could have a significant negative impact on our earnings and cash flow. In addition, we may not have enough insurance to cover any loss of property or other claims resulting from these risks. Exploration, development and production activities carry inherent risk. These activities, as well as natural disasters or adverse weather conditions, could result in liability exposure or the loss of production and revenues.Our crude oil and natural gas operations are subject to hazards and risks inherent in the drilling, production and transportation of crude oil, natural gas and NGLs, including:•pipeline ruptures and spills;•fires, explosions, blowouts and well cratering;•equipment malfunctions and/or mechanical failure on high-volume, high-impact wells;•malfunctions and/or mechanical failure at terminals or other onshore delivery points;•leaks or spills occurring during the transfer of hydrocarbons from an FPSO to an oil tanker;•loss of product occurring as a result of transfer to a rail car or train derailments;•formations with abnormal pressures and basin subsidence which could result in leakage or loss of access to hydrocarbons;•release of pollutants;38Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements•spills, leaks or discharges of fluids used in or produced in the course of operations, especially those that reach surface water or groundwater; and•security breaches, cyber attacks, piracy or terroristic acts.Some of these risks or hazards could materially and adversely affect our revenues and expenses by reducing or shutting in production from wells, loss of equipment or otherwise negatively impacting the projected economic performance of our projects. In addition, our ability to deliver product pursuant to long-term supply contracts could be negatively impacted resulting in additional financial exposure in the event we cannot fully deliver the contract quantities.Any of these risks or hazards can result in injuries and/or deaths of employees, supplier personnel or other individuals, loss of hydrocarbons, environmental pollution and other damage to our properties or the properties of others, regulatory investigations and administrative, civil and criminal penalties or restricted access to our properties.In addition, our operations and financial results could be significantly impacted by adverse weather conditions and natural disasters in the areas we operate including:•hurricanes, tropical storms, cyclones, windstorms, or “superstorms” which could affect our operations in areas such as Texas, deepwater Gulf of Mexico, and the Marcellus Shale; •winter storms and snow which could affect our operations in the DJ Basin and Marcellus Shale;•extremely high temperatures, which could affect third party gathering and processing facilities in the DJ Basin and Texas;•severe droughts resulting in new restrictions on water usage in the DJ Basin, Marcellus Shale and Texas;•harsh weather and rough seas offshore the Falkland Islands and Newfoundland, which could limit exploration activities; and•other natural disasters.Any of these can result in loss of hydrocarbons, environmental pollution and other damage to our properties or the properties of others, or restricted access to our properties.Development drilling may not result in commercially productive quantities of oil and gas reserves from unconventional or conventional resources.We depend on development projects to provide sustained cash flows after investment and attractive financial returns. However, development drilling is not always successful and the profitability of development projects may change over time.In new development areas, available data may not allow us to completely know the extent of the reservoir or the best locations for drilling development wells. Therefore, a development well we drill may be a dry hole or result in noncommercial quantities of hydrocarbons.Onshore, we are currently planning to invest significant amounts of capital to continue development of our onshore US unconventional resources. In unconventional basins, development is highly dependent on the use of new technologies to drive cost efficiencies in drilling and completion as well as on the availability of third party infrastructure to provide flow assurance and transportation of production to end markets.Offshore, we are progressing the first phase development of the Leviathan natural gas project, planning the Tamar expansion project and evaluating development options for our Katmai discovery. Development of offshore resources is capital and resource-intensive and may require several years to complete. In order to timely advance significant offshore discoveries, we may progress multiple development concepts simultaneously, with the realization that only one concept may ultimately be approved or be economically feasible. This approach may result in our writing off costs related to certain development concepts that must be eliminated from further consideration once a final development option has been determined. Even if development drilling is successful and we find commercial quantities of reserves, we may encounter difficulties or delays in completing development wells. For example, frontier areas or less developed onshore areas may not have adequate infrastructure for gathering, processing or transportation, and production may be delayed until they are constructed. Costs of drilling, completing and operating wells can be uncertain, and cost factors can adversely affect the economic viability of a project. Inability to drill profitably or market our production, could decrease our current cash flows and reduce the return on our investment.39Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsExploratory drilling may not result in the discovery of commercially productive reservoirs. Exploration success within existing or new frontier areas provides for growth in production and reserves. Exploratory drilling requires significant capital investment and does not always result in commercial quantities of hydrocarbons or new development projects.Exploratory dry holes can occur because seismic data and other technologies we use to determine potential exploratory drilling locations do not allow us to know conclusively prior to drilling a well that crude oil or natural gas is present or may be produced economically. In addition, a well may be successful in locating hydrocarbons, but we and our partners may decide not to develop the prospect due to other considerations. Exploratory drilling activities may be curtailed, delayed or canceled, or development plans may change, resulting in significant exploration expense, as a result of a variety of factors, including:•lower commodity price outlook;•title problems;•near-term lease expiration;•decisions impacting allocation of capital;•compliance with environmental and other governmental requirements;•availability of market, or costs to develop infrastructure;•increases in the cost of, or shortages or delays in the availability of, drilling rigs, equipment and qualified personnel;•unexpected drilling conditions;•pressure or other irregularities in formations;•equipment failures or accidents; and•adverse weather conditions.In addition, companies seeking new reserves often face more difficult environments, such as oil sands, deepwater, or ultra-deepwater, and often need to develop or invest in new technologies. This environment increases cost as well as drilling risk.For certain capital-intensive offshore projects, it may take several years to evaluate the future potential of an exploratory well and make a determination of its economic viability, resulting in delays in cash flows from production start-up and a lower return on our investment.See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 6. Capitalized Exploratory Well Costs and Undeveloped Leasehold Costs.Our operations require us to comply with a number of US and international laws and regulations, violations of which could result in substantial fines or sanctions and/or impair our ability to do business. Our operations require us to comply with complex and frequently-changing US and international laws and regulations, such as those involving anti-corruption, competition and antitrust, anti-boycott, anti-money laundering, import-export control, marketing, environmental and/or taxation.For example, the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and similar laws and regulations enacted or promulgated by countries pursuant to the 1997 Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development Anti-Bribery Convention generally prohibit improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business. We conduct some of our operations in developing countries that have relatively underdeveloped legal and regulatory systems compared to more developed countries. These countries generally are perceived as presenting an increased risk of corruption. Additionally, certain of our operations involve the use of agents and other intermediaries whose conduct and actions could be imputed to us by anti-corruption enforcement authorities. Violations of the FCPA or other anti-corruption laws could subject us to substantial fines or sanctions and impair our ability to do business. The import/export of equipment and supplies necessary for oil and gas exploration and development activities, as well as the export of crude oil, natural gas, and liquids production are regulated by the import/export laws of the US and other countries in which we operate. In the US, certain items required for oil and gas development activities may be considered “dual-use”, having both commercial and military applications and, therefore, may be subject to specific import or export restrictions. In addition, the US government imposes economic and trade sanctions against certain foreign countries and regimes. The sanctions are based on US foreign policy and national security goals and may change over time.Mergers of businesses often require the approval of certain government or regulatory agencies and such approval could contain terms, conditions, or restrictions that would be detrimental to our business after a merger. US antitrust laws require waiting periods and even after completion of a merger, governmental authorities could seek to block or challenge a merger as they deem necessary or desirable in the public interest. We have merged with or acquired other companies in the past. Prevention of a merger by antitrust laws could impair our ability to do business. Furthermore, mergers and acquisitions expose us to potential 40Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statementslawsuits or other obligations not yet anticipated at time of merger or acquisition. Such liabilities and obligations could hinder our ability to fully benefit from the acquired business or assets and negatively impact our financial performance. As a developer, owner and operator of crude oil and natural gas properties, we are subject to various laws and regulations relating to the discharge of materials into, and the protection of, the environment. Violations of environmental laws and regulations could result in fines or required mitigation activities. See We are subject to increasing governmental regulations and environmental requirements that may cause us to incur substantial incremental costs, below, and Item 8.

In addition, in certain areas, legal enforcement may be impacted by significant new incentives for whistleblowers. Violations of any laws or regulations caused by either failure of our internal controls related to regulatory compliance or failure of our employees to comply with our internal policies could result in substantial civil or criminal fines, sanctions, or loss of our license to operate. In addition, as we continue to pursue exploration opportunities with new partners in new geographical locations, our ability to mitigate risks of actual or alleged violations could decrease. Actual or alleged violations of US and international laws could damage our reputation, be expensive to defend, and impair our ability to do business. We face various risks associated with global populism and general political uncertainty.Following the 2008/2009 global financial crisis, the world has experienced lower economic growth versus the levels attained in previous decades. This has resulted in economic stagnation for certain citizens and as a result, there are concerns around jobs, economic well-being and wealth distribution. Globally, certain individuals and organizations are attempting to focus the public's attention on income and wealth distribution and implement income and wealth redistribution policies.In addition, there have been recent efforts to challenge and change individual and/or corporate taxation. These efforts, if they gain political traction, could result in increased taxation on individuals and/or corporations, as well as, potentially, increased regulation on companies and financial institutions. These measures would further burden companies and individuals with additional tax costs. Recent events have intensified these risks. In the US, the growing trend toward populism, coupled with the recent change in US Administration, have resulted in uncertainty regarding potential changes in regulations, fiscal policy, social programs, domestic and foreign relations and international trade policies. For example, the new US Administration recently signaled a potential change in US relations with Russia and China, and signed an Executive Order to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Global uncertainty and/or reductions in global trade activities could contribute to slower economic growth which could negatively business and commerce. Potential changes in relationships among the US, China and Russia, or among China, Russia and other countries, can have significant impacts on the balance of power, as well as on global trade, with further impacts on both global and local economies. In addition, changes in the relationships between the US and its neighbors, such as Mexico, can have significant, potentially negative, impacts on commerce. In Europe, the populist movement has resulted in the Brexit vote, and recent election results are signaling increasing populist demands and rises in nationalism, which could have a negative impact on economic policy and consequently pose a potential threat to the unity of the European Union. Our ability to respond to these developments or comply with any resulting new legal or regulatory requirements, including those involving economic and trade sanctions, as well as any potential increased tax expense, could reduce our ability to negotiate the sale of our products, increase our costs of doing business, reduce our financial flexibility and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of our operations.We face various risks associated with the trend toward increased anti-development activity. As new technologies have been applied to our industry in recent years, we have seen significant growth in non-OPEC crude oil and natural gas supply, particularly in the US. With this expansion of activity, opposition toward oil and gas drilling and development activity has been growing both in the US and globally. Companies in our industry can be the target of opposition to development from certain stakeholder groups, including national and local governments and regulatory agencies. These anti-development efforts could be focused on limiting hydrocarbon development; reducing access to national and state government lands; delaying or canceling certain projects such as offshore drilling, shale development, and pipeline construction; limiting or banning the use of hydraulic fracturing; blocking activity in certain areas such as the Arctic; denying air-quality permits for drilling; and advocating for increased regulations on shale drilling and hydraulic fracturing. Potential changes in regulations, as signaled by the current US Administration, could intensify the risk of anti-development efforts as grass roots opposition efforts grow.In addition, the use of social media channels can be used to cause rapid, widespread reputational harm.Future anti-development efforts could result in the following:41Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements•blocked development;•denial or delay of permits;•shortening of lease terms or reduction in lease size;•restrictions on installation or operation of gathering, processing or pipeline facilities;•restrictions on the transportation of crude oil and natural gas;•restrictions on the use of certain operating practices, such as hydraulic fracturing;•reduced access to water supplies or restrictions on water disposal;•limited access or damage to or destruction of our property;•legal challenges or lawsuits;•targeted activist shareholder campaigns; •increased regulation of our business;•damaging publicity about the Company;•increased costs of doing business;•reduction in demand for our products; and•other adverse effects on our ability to develop our properties and expand production.Our need to incur costs associated with responding to these initiatives or complying with any new legal or regulatory requirements resulting from these activities that are substantial and not adequately provided for, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. A cyber incident could result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption and/or financial loss. The oil and gas industry has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct day-to-day operations including certain exploration, development and production activities. For example, software programs are used to interpret seismic data, manage drilling rigs, production equipment and gathering and transportation systems, conduct reservoir modeling and reserves estimation, and for compliance reporting. The use of mobile communication devices has increased rapidly. Industrial control systems such as SCADA (supervisory control and data acquisition) now control large scale processes that can include multiple sites and long distances, such as power generation and transmission, communications and oil and gas pipelines.We depend on digital technology, including information systems and related infrastructure as well as cloud applications and services, to process and record financial and operating data, communicate with our employees and business partners, analyze seismic and drilling information, estimate quantities of oil and gas reserves as well as other activities related to our business. Our business partners, including vendors, service providers, purchasers of our production, and financial institutions, are also dependent on digital technology. The technologies needed to conduct oil and gas exploration and development activities in deepwater, ultra-deepwater and shale, and global competition for oil and gas resources make certain information the target of theft or misappropriation.As dependence on digital technologies has increased, cyber incidents, including deliberate attacks or unintentional events, also has increased. A cyber attack could include gaining unauthorized access to digital systems for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, corrupting data, or causing operational disruption, or result in denial-of-service on websites. SCADA-based systems are potentially vulnerable to targeted cyber attacks due to their critical role in operations.Our technologies, systems, networks, and those of our business partners may become the target of cyber attacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of proprietary and other information, or other disruption of our business operations. In addition, certain cyber incidents, such as surveillance, may remain undetected for an extended period.A cyber incident involving our information systems and related infrastructure, or that of our business partners, could disrupt our business plans and negatively impact our operations in the following ways, among others:•unauthorized access to seismic data, reserves information or other sensitive or proprietary information could have a negative impact on our ability to compete for oil and gas resources;•data corruption, communication interruption, or other operational disruption during drilling activities could result in failure to reach the intended target or a drilling incident;•data corruption or operational disruption of production infrastructure could result in loss of production, or accidental discharge;•a cyber attack on a vendor or service provider could result in supply chain disruptions which could delay or halt a development project, effectively delaying the start of cash flows from the project;•a cyber attack on a third party gathering or pipeline service provider could prevent us from marketing our production, resulting in a loss of revenues;•a cyber attack involving commodities exchanges or financial institutions could slow or halt commodities trading, thus preventing us from marketing our production or engaging in hedging activities, resulting in a loss of revenues;42Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements•a cyber attack which halts activities at a power generation facility or refinery using natural gas as feed stock could have a significant impact on the natural gas market, resulting in reduced demand for our production, lower natural gas prices, and reduced revenues;•a cyber attack on a communications network or power grid could cause operational disruption resulting in loss of revenues;•a deliberate corruption of our financial or operational data could result in events of non-compliance which could lead to regulatory fines or penalties; and•business interruptions could result in expensive remediation efforts, distraction of management, damage to our reputation, or a negative impact on the price of our common stock.Our implementation of various controls and processes, including globally incorporating a risk-based cyber security framework, to monitor and mitigate security threats and to increase security for our information, facilities and infrastructure is costly and labor intensive. Moreover, there can be no assurance that such measures will be sufficient to prevent security breaches from occurring. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities.Federal, state and local hydraulic fracturing and water disposal legislation and regulation could increase our costs or restrict our ability to produce crude oil, natural gas and NGLs economically and in commercial quantities.While hydraulic fracturing has been utilized in oil and gas development for decades, certain parties have called for further study of the technique's alleged environmental and health effects, for additional regulation of the technique and, in some cases, for a moratorium or ban on the use of hydraulic fracturing. Because of elevated public sensitivity around the topic, federal, state and local governments are continually conducting studies, evaluating their regulatory programs and considering additional requirements on and regulation of hydraulic fracturing practices. For example, various recommendations with respect to unconventional gas have been issued by the Shale Gas Production Subcommittee, a subcommittee of the Secretary of Energy Advisory Board, and the US Department of Energy's National Energy Technology Laboratory is conducting a comprehensive assessment of the environmental effects of shale gas production.At the national level, proposals have been introduced from time to time in the US Congress that, if implemented, would subject hydraulic fracturing to further regulation thereby limiting its use or increasing its cost. Federal agencies addressing hydraulic fracturing under existing authorities include the EPA, which has issued reports and developed various rules and guidelines regarding hydraulic fracturing activities, and the Bureau of Land management, under the US Department of the Interior, which has issued final rules impacting hydraulic fracturing on federal lands. In addition, OSHA and NIOSH have authority to regulate certain workplace practices. All of the states, as well as certain localities, where we operate have adopted or may adopt additional regulations on drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing in particular. For example, a number of local communities in Colorado have attempted to increase regulatory requirements on oil and gas development. In addition, some state regulatory agencies have modified their regulations to account for potential induced seismicity with regard to the operation of injection wells used for oil and gas waste disposal.We are dependent on the use of hydraulic fracturing practices to produce commercial quantities of crude oil and natural gas, particularly from wells in our onshore US basins. Additional federal, state or local restrictions on hydraulic fracturing, water disposal or other drilling activities that may be imposed in areas where we conduct business, such as onshore US, could significantly increase our operating, capital and compliance costs as well as delay or halt our ability to develop crude oil, natural gas and NGL reserves. See Items 1. and 2. Business and Properties – Regulations and – Hydraulic Fracturing.The marketability of our production is dependent upon transportation and processing facilities over which we may have no direct control.The marketability of our production from our onshore US areas and deepwater Gulf of Mexico depends in part upon the availability, proximity and capacity of pipelines, natural gas gathering systems, rail service, and processing facilities. We deliver crude oil, natural gas and NGLs produced from these areas through gathering systems and pipelines, the majority of which we do not own. In Israel, we rely on a state-owned pipeline and transportation system to deliver our production to customers and end users. Offshore Equatorial Guinea, our natural gas production is delivered to onshore processing and storage facilities operated by our partner, and the resulting products, as well as our crude oil production from Aseng and Alen, are lifted to tankers owned by third-parties.Third-party systems and facilities may not be available to us in the future at a price that is acceptable to us. In addition, the lack of availability or capacity on third-party systems and facilities could reduce the price offered for our production or result in the shut-in of producing wells or the delay or discontinuance of development plans for properties. Even where we have some 43Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statementscontractual control over the transportation of our production through firm transportation arrangements, third-party systems and facilities may be temporarily unavailable due to market conditions or mechanical reliability or other reasons, including adverse weather conditions.Any significant change in market factors or other conditions affecting these infrastructure systems and facilities, as well as any delays in constructing new infrastructure systems and facilities, could delay production, thereby harming our business and, in turn, our results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.Restricted land access could reduce our ability to explore for and develop crude oil, natural gas and NGL reserves. Our ability to adequately explore for and develop crude oil and natural gas resources is affected by a number of factors related to access to land. Examples of factors which reduce our access to land include, among others:•new municipal or state land use regulations, which may restrict drilling locations or certain activities such as hydraulic fracturing;•local and municipal government control of land or zoning requirements, which can conflict with state law and deprive land owners of property development rights;•landowner, community and/or governmental opposition to infrastructure development;•regulation of federal land by the BLM;•anti-development activities, which can reduce our access to leases through legal challenges or lawsuits, disruption of drilling, or damage to equipment;•the presence of threatened or endangered species or of their habitat;•disputes regarding leases; and•disputes with landowners, royalty owners, or other operators over such matters as title transfer, joint interest billing arrangements, revenue distribution, or production or cost sharing arrangements.Loss of access to land for which we own mineral rights could result in a reduction in our proved reserves and a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows. Reduced ability to obtain new leases could constrain our future growth and opportunity set by limiting the expansion of our portfolio.Our entry into new exploration ventures in countries which have no history of hydrocarbon sector investment subjects us to risks. We hold working interests in certain areas, each of which currently has minimal or no crude oil or natural gas production, and in certain cases, limited infrastructure, including offshore areas of Cyprus, Falkland Islands, Cameroon, Gabon, Suriname and Newfoundland. Our activities will be subject to risks including, among others:•exploration activities in frontier areas may not result in commercially productive quantities of crude oil, natural gas and NGL reserves;•remote locations make it more difficult and time-consuming to transport personnel, equipment and supplies; •certain operating environments, such as offshore the Falkland Islands and Newfoundland, include harsh weather and rough seas which could limit seismic surveys and other exploration activities during certain periods; •pandemics and epidemics, which may adversely affect our business operations through travel or other restrictions; and•there have been numerous acts of piracy, kidnapping, civil strife, regional conflict, border disputes, cross-border violence, and war, as well as violence associated with corruption, drug trafficking and regime changes in certain areas.These, and other risks, could be intensified if commercial quantities of crude oil or natural gas are discovered. In addition, if commercial quantities of hydrocarbons are discovered, societies with minimal or no current production must begin to address such topics as sector regulation and distribution of government proceeds from hydrocarbon sales, the results of which could have a negative impact on our business. We may not be able to compensate for or fully mitigate these risks. Our ability to produce crude oil, natural gas and NGLs economically and in commercial quantities could be impaired if we are unable to acquire adequate supplies of water for our drilling operations or are unable to dispose of or recycle the water we use economically and in an environmentally safe manner.Drilling and development activities require the use of water and results in the production of waste water. For example, the hydraulic fracturing process which we employ to produce commercial quantities of crude oil, natural gas and NGLs from many reservoirs requires the use and disposal of significant quantities of water. In certain regions, there may be insufficient local capacity to provide a source of water for drilling activities. In those cases, water must be obtained from other sources and transported to the drilling site, adding to the development cost. Waste water from oil and gas operations often is disposed of via underground injection. Some studies have linked earthquakes or induced seismicity in certain areas to underground injection, which is leading to increased public scrutiny of injection safety. 44Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsThe development of new environmental initiatives or regulations related to acquisition, withdrawal, storage and use of surface water or groundwater, or treatment and discharge of water waste, may limit our ability to use techniques such as hydraulic fracturing, increase our development and operating costs and cause delays, interruptions or termination of our operations, the extent of which cannot be predicted, all of which could have an adverse effect on our operations and financial condition. See Items 1. and 2. Business and Properties – Hydraulic Fracturing.Indebtedness may limit our liquidity and financial flexibility.At December 31, 2016, we had $7.1 billion of debt, and indebtedness represented 43% of our total book capitalization (sum of debt plus shareholders' equity).Our indebtedness affects our operations in several ways, including the following:•a portion of our cash flows from operating activities must be used to service our indebtedness and is not available for other purposes;•we may be at a competitive disadvantage as compared to similar companies that have less debt;•a covenant contained in our Credit Agreement provides that our total debt to capitalization ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) will not exceed 65% at any time, which may make additional borrowings more expensive, thereby affecting our flexibility in planning for, and reacting to, changes in the economy and our industry; •additional future financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate or other purposes may have higher costs and more restrictive covenants;•changes in our debt credit ratings may negatively affect the cost, terms, conditions and/or availability of future financing, and lower ratings will increase the interest rate and fees we pay on our unsecured revolving credit facility (Revolving Credit Facility); and•we may be more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions.We may incur additional debt in order to fund our exploration, development and acquisition activities. A higher level of indebtedness increases the risk that our financial flexibility may deteriorate. Our ability to meet our debt obligations and service our debt depends on future performance. General economic conditions, commodity prices, and financial, business and other factors will affect our operations and our future performance. Many of these factors are beyond our control and we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to pay the interest on our debt, and future working capital, borrowings and equity financing may not be available to pay or refinance such debt. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 10. Long-Term Debt. A downgrade or other negative action with respect to our credit rating could negatively impact our business and financial condition.A downgrade or other negative rating action could affect our requirements to post collateral as financial assurance of performance under certain contractual arrangements, such as pipeline transportation contracts, crude oil and natural gas sales contracts, work commitments and certain abandonment obligations, and potentially subject us to additional bonding and other assurance requirements with respect to our deepwater Gulf of Mexico development plans. A lowering of our credit rating may negatively affect the cost, terms, conditions and availability of future financing.We face significant competition and many of our competitors have resources in excess of our available resources.We operate in highly competitive areas of crude oil and natural gas exploration, development, acquisition and production. We face intense competition from: •large multi-national, integrated oil and gas companies;•state-controlled national oil companies;•US independent oil and gas companies;•US onshore midstream companies;•service companies engaging in exploration and production activities; and•private investing in oil and gas equity funds.We face competition in a number of areas such as:•seeking to acquire desirable producing properties or new leases for future exploration;•acquiring or increasing access to gathering, processing and transportation services and capacity;•marketing our crude oil, natural gas and NGL production;•seeking to acquire the equipment and expertise necessary to operate and develop properties; and•attracting and retaining employees with certain skills.45Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsMany of our competitors have financial and other resources substantially in excess of those available to us. Such companies may be able to pay more for seismic information and lease rights on crude oil and natural gas properties and exploratory prospects and to define, evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit. This highly competitive environment could have an adverse impact on our business.Estimates of crude oil, natural gas and NGL reserves are not precise. Reservoir engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of crude oil, natural gas and NGLs that cannot be measured in an exact manner, and there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating reserves quantities and their value, including factors that are beyond our control. In accordance with the SEC's rules for oil and gas reserves reporting, our reserves estimates are based on 12-month average commodity prices; therefore, reserves quantities will change when actual prices increase or decrease. As estimated production, development and abandonment costs are based on year-end economic conditions, reserves quantities will also change when these costs increase or decrease.Reserves estimates depend on a number of factors and assumptions that may vary considerably from actual results, including:•historical production from the area compared with production from other areas;•the assumed effects of regulations by governmental agencies, including the SEC;•assumptions concerning future crude oil, natural gas, and NGL prices;•anticipated development cycle time;•future development costs; •future operating and abandonment costs;•impacts of cost recovery provisions in contracts with foreign governments;•severance and excise taxes; and•workover and remedial costs.For these reasons, estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of crude oil, natural gas and NGLs attributable to any particular group of properties, classifications of those reserves based on risk of recovery, and estimates of the future net cash flows expected from them prepared by different petroleum engineers, or by the same petroleum engineers but at different times, may vary substantially. Estimation of crude oil, natural gas and NGL reserves in emerging areas or areas with limited historical production is inherently more difficult, and we may have less experience in such areas. Accordingly, reserves estimates may be subject to positive or negative revisions, and actual production, revenues and expenditures with respect to our reserves likely will vary, possibly materially, from estimates. Any such negative revisions could result in an asset impairment charge.Additionally, some of our reserves estimates are calculated using volumetric analysis, which involves estimating the volume of a reservoir based on the net feet of pay of the structure and an estimation of the area covered by the structure. Reserves estimates using volumetric analysis are less reliable than estimates based on a lengthy production history. In addition, realization or recognition of proved undeveloped reserves will depend on our development schedule and plans. A change in future development plans for proved undeveloped reserves could cause the discontinuation of the classification of these reserves as proved. See Items 1. and 2. Business and Properties – Proved Reserves Disclosures.We operate in a litigious environment. Some of the jurisdictions within which we operate have proven to be litigious environments. Oil and gas companies, such as us, can be involved in various legal proceedings, such as title, royalty, or contractual disputes, in the ordinary course of business. For example, in the state of Louisiana, oil and gas companies are often the target of “legacy lawsuits,” by which a landowner claims that oil and gas operations, often performed many years ago and by another operator, caused pollution or contamination of a property. Various properties we have owned over the past decades potentially expose us to “legacy lawsuit” claims. Similarly, neighboring landowners may allege that current operations cause contamination or create a nuisance.Because we maintain a diversified portfolio of assets that includes both US and international projects, the complexity and types of legal procedures with which we may become involved may vary, and we could incur significant legal and support expenses in different jurisdictions. For instance, we historically have had to address certain fiscal, antitrust and other regulatory challenges in Israel, including a current class action lawsuit filed by petitioners alleging we and our partners in Tamar violated antitrust laws through the monopolistic pricing of natural gas to the citizens of Israel. Legal proceedings such as this could result in a substantial liability and/or negative publicity about us and adversely affect the price of our common stock. In addition, legal proceedings distract management and other personnel from their primary responsibilities. These proceedings are subject to the uncertainties inherent in any litigation. We will defend ourselves vigorously in all such matters. However, if we are not able to successfully defend ourselves, there could be a delay or even halt in our exploration, development or production activities or other business plans, resulting in a reduction in reserves, loss of production and reduced cash flows. 46Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsOne of our subsidiaries acts as the general partner of a publicly traded master limited partnership, Noble Midstream Partners, which may involve a greater exposure to legal liability than our historic business operations.One of our subsidiaries acts as the general partner of Noble Midstream Partners, a publicly traded master limited partnership. Our control of the general partner of Noble Midstream Partners may increase the possibility that we could be subject to claims of breach of fiduciary duties, including claims of conflicts of interest, related to Noble Midstream Partners. Any liability resulting from such claims could have a material adverse effect on our future business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Failure to adequately fund continued capital expenditures could adversely affect our properties.Our exploration, development, and acquisition activities require capital expenditures to achieve production and cash flows. In particular, major offshore projects have a multi-year long development cycle time, which means that development spending occurs for several years before the project begins producing hydrocarbons and generating cash flows. As examples, assets and infrastructure for export of natural gas from Leviathan will require a multi-billion dollar investment prior to production startup. Furthermore, while the majority of our assets are held by production, certain of our assets, such as our Eagle Ford Shale and Permian Basin properties, are held through continuous development obligations. Therefore, we are contractually obligated to fund a level of development activity in these areas and failure to meet these obligations may result in the loss of a lease. Historically, we have funded our capital expenditures through a combination of cash flows from operations, our Revolving Credit Facility, debt and equity issuances, and occasional sales of assets. Future cash flows from operations are subject to a number of variables, such as the level of production from existing wells, commodity prices, and our success in finding, developing and producing new reserves. For 2017, our capital investment program is flexible to address potential commodity price changes. If commodity prices decline for an extended period of time, we will evaluate our level of capital spending and likely reduce our investment program. As a result, we will have less ability to replace our reserves through drilling operations and may elect to forfeit our ownership interests or rights to participate in some properties, resulting in lower production over time as compared with prior years. See Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Operating Outlook 2017 – Capital Investment Program.We may be subject to risks in connection with acquisition and divestiture activities. As part of our business strategy, we have made, and will likely continue to make, acquisitions of oil and gas properties and/or entities that own them. Furthermore, if we are unable to make attractive acquisitions, our future growth could be limited. Moreover, even if we do make acquisitions, they may not result in an increase in our cash flows from operations or otherwise result in the benefits anticipated due to various risks, including, but not limited to:•incorrect estimates or assumptions about reserves, exploration potential or potential drilling locations;•incorrect assumptions regarding future revenues, including future commodity prices and differentials, or regarding future development and operating costs;•incorrect assumptions regarding potential synergies and the overall costs of equity or debt;•difficulties in integrating the operations, technologies, products and personnel of the acquired assets or business; and•unknown and unforeseen liabilities or other issues related to any acquisition for which contractual protections prove inadequate, including environmental liabilities and title defects.The acquisition of a property or business requires management to make complex judgments and assessments, and the accuracy of the assessments is inherently uncertain. In connection with these assessments, we perform a review of the subject properties that we believe to be consistent with industry practices. Our review will not reveal all existing or potential problems, nor will it permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to fully assess their deficiencies and capabilities.We also maintain an ongoing portfolio management program to ensure our company is well-positioned with assets that offer growth at financially attractive investment options. Therefore, we may periodically divest certain material assets which may help to generate organizational and operational efficiencies as well as cash for use in our capital investment program or to repay outstanding debt. We strive to obtain the most attractive prices for our assets; however, various factors can materially affect our ability to dispose of assets on terms acceptable to us. Such factors may include:•current commodity prices;•laws and regulations impacting oil and gas operations in the areas where the assets are located;•willingness of the purchaser to assume certain liabilities such as asset retirement obligations;•our willingness to indemnify buyers for certain matters; and•delays in closing. 47Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsInability to achieve a desired price for the assets, or underestimation of amounts of retained liabilities or indemnification obligations, can result in a reduction of cash proceeds, a loss on sale due to an excess of the asset's net book value over proceeds, or liabilities which must be settled in the future at amounts that are higher than we anticipated.An uneconomic or unsuccessful acquisition or divestiture effort may divert management’s attention and our financial resources away from existing operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.We are exposed to counterparty credit risk as a result of our receivables, hedging transactions and cash investments.We are exposed to risk of financial loss from trade, joint venture, and other receivables. We sell our crude oil, natural gas and NGLs to a variety of purchasers. In addition, we are the operator on a majority of our joint venture development projects. As operator of the joint ventures, we pay joint venture expenses and make cash calls on our nonoperating partners for their respective shares of joint venture costs. These projects are capital cost intensive and, in some cases, a nonoperating partner may experience a delay in obtaining financing for its share of the joint venture costs. For example, our partners in the Eastern Mediterranean must obtain financing for their share of significant development expenditures at Leviathan.In addition, some of our purchasers and joint venture partners are not as creditworthy as we are and may experience credit downgrades or liquidity problems that may hinder their ability to obtain financing. Counterparty liquidity problems could result in a delay in our receiving proceeds from commodity sales or reimbursement of joint venture costs. Nonperformance by a trade creditor or joint venture partner could result in significant financial losses.Our hedging transactions expose us to risk of financial loss if a counterparty fails to perform under a derivative contract. During periods of falling commodity prices, our commodity derivative receivable positions increase, which increases our counterparty credit exposure. We also had approximately $1.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2016 deposited with financial institutions, a majority of which was invested in money market funds and short-term deposits with major financial institutions. While we monitor the creditworthiness of the banks and financial institutions with which we invest and engage in hedging transactions, and maintain credit insurance, we are unable to predict sudden changes in solvency of the financial institutions and may be exposed to associated risks. If one or more of our trade creditors, joint venture partners, hedge counterparties and financial institutions were to experience a sudden deterioration in liquidity, it could impair their ability to perform under the terms of our contracts. We are unable to predict sudden changes in creditworthiness or ability of these parties to perform and could incur significant financial losses. Commodity hedging transactions may limit our potential gains or fail to protect us from declines in commodity prices.In order to reduce the impact of commodity price uncertainty and increase cash flow predictability relating to the marketing of our crude oil and natural gas, we may enter into hedging arrangements with respect to a portion of our expected revenues. Our hedges, consisting of a series of derivative instrument contracts, are limited in duration, usually for periods of one to three years. While intended to reduce the effects of volatile crude oil and natural gas prices, such transactions may limit our potential gains if prices rise over the price established by the arrangements. Conversely, our hedging program may be inadequate to protect us from continuing and prolonged declines in the price of crude oil or natural gas.Global commodity prices are volatile. Such volatility challenges our ability to forecast and, as a result, it may become more difficult to manage our hedging program. In trying to manage our exposure to commodity price risk, we may end up hedging too much or too little, depending upon how our crude oil or natural gas volumes and our production mix fluctuate in the future. Hedging transactions may also expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including instances in which: our production is less than expected; there is a widening of price basis differentials between delivery points for our production and the delivery point assumed in the hedge arrangement; the counterparties to our futures contracts fail to perform under the contracts; or a sudden unexpected event materially impacts crude oil or natural gas prices. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 8. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.The insurance we carry is insufficient to cover all of the risks we face, which could result in significant financial exposure. Exploration for and production of crude oil and natural gas can be hazardous, involving natural disasters or other catastrophic events such as blowouts, well cratering, fire and explosion and loss of well control which can result in damage to or destruction of wells or production facilities, injury to persons, loss of life, or damage to property and the environment. Exploration and production activities are also subject to risk from political developments such as terrorist acts, piracy, civil disturbances, war, and expropriation or nationalization of assets, which can cause loss of or damage to our property. Our insurance program may not minimize or fully protect us from losses resulting from damages to or the loss of physical assets or loss of human life, liability claims of third parties, and business interruption (loss of production) attributed to certain assets and including such occurrences as well blowouts and resulting oil spills. We do not have insurance protection against all the risks we face, because we choose not to insure certain risks, insurance is not available at a level that balances the cost of insurance and our desired rates of return, or actual losses may exceed coverage limits. 48Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsWe expect the future availability and cost of insurance to be impacted by such events as hurricanes, earthquakes, tsunami and other natural disasters. Impacts could include tighter underwriting standards; limitations on scope and amount of coverage; and higher premiums, and will depend, in part, on future changes in laws and regulations regarding exploration and production activities in the Gulf of Mexico and other areas in which we operate, including possible increases in liability caps for claims of damages from oil spills. We will continue to monitor for any legislative or regulatory changes related to offshore exploration and production and its potential impact on the insurance market and our overall risk profile, and adjust our risk and insurance program to provide protection, at a level that we can afford considering the cost of insurance and our desired rates of return, against disruption to our operations and cash flows. If an event occurs that is not covered by insurance or not fully protected by insured limits, it could have a significant adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. See Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources – Risk and Insurance Program.We are subject to increasing governmental regulations and environmental requirements that may cause us to incur substantial incremental costs.Our industry is subject to complex laws and regulations adopted or promulgated by international, federal, state and local authorities relating to the exploration for, and the development, production and marketing of, crude oil, natural gas and NGLs. Changes in price controls, taxes and environmental laws relating to our industry have the ability to substantially affect crude oil, natural gas and NGL production, operations and economics. Environmental laws, in particular, can change frequently, often become stricter and at times may force us to incur additional costs as changes are implemented.We cannot always predict with certainty how agencies or courts will interpret existing laws and regulations or the effect these interpretations may have on our business or financial condition, and the recent change in US Administration has increased uncertainty in these matters.Additionally, the unintentional discharge of natural gas, crude oil, or other pollutants into the air, soil or water may give rise to liabilities on our part to government agencies and/or third parties, and may require us to incur costs to achieve remediation objectives and/or requirements. In April 2015, for example, we entered into a Consent Decree with the US EPA, US Department of Justice and State of Colorado to improve emission control systems at a number of our condensate storage tanks in the DJ Basin. The Consent Decree required us to pay a civil penalty and to perform certain injunctive relief activities, mitigation projects, and supplemental environmental projects. We continue to incur costs associated with these activities. In addition, compliance with the Consent Decree could result in the temporary shut in or permanent plugging and abandonment of certain wells and associated tank batteries within the Non-Attainment Area of the DJ Basin.Noncompliance with existing or future legislation or regulations could potentially result in an increased risk of civil or criminal fines or sanctions. For example, fines or sanctions associated with a well incident or spill could well exceed the actual cost of containment and cleanup. Further expansion of environmental, safety and performance regulations or an increase in liability for drilling or production activities, including punitive fines, may have one or more of the following impacts on our business:•increase the costs of drilling exploratory and development wells;•cause delays in, or preclude, the development of our projects resulting in longer development cycle times;•result in additional operating and capital costs;•divert our cash flows from capital investments in order to maintain liquidity;•increase or remove liability caps for claims of damages from oil spills;•increase our share of civil or criminal fines or sanctions for actual or alleged violations if a well incident were to occur; and•limit our ability to obtain additional insurance coverage, at a level that balances the cost of insurance and our desired rates of return, to protect against any increase in liability.Any of the above operating or financial factors may result in a reduction of our cash flows, profitability, and the fair value of our properties or reduce our financial flexibility. Because we strive to achieve certain levels of return on our projects, an increase in our financial responsibility could result in certain of our planned projects becoming uneconomic. See Items 1. and 2. Business and Properties – Regulations.A change in international and/or US federal and state climate policy could have a significant impact on our operations and profitability.Climate and related energy policy, laws and regulations could change, and substantial uncertainty exists about the nature of many potential developments that could impact the sources and uses of energy. The Paris Agreement, which calls for State parties to establish their own nationally determined contributions (NDCs) for reducing carbon output, entered into force in 49Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsNovember 2016. The previous US Administration’s NDC, if not altered, would commit the US to achieve an economy-wide target of reducing its GHG emissions by 26-28% less than the 2005 level by 2025 and to use best efforts to reach a 28% reduction. There are federal and state responses to climate and energy concerns in the form of laws, regulations and operating guidance, which could alter future demand for our products. Under the previous US Administration, federal agencies in particular pursued a wide variety of climate initiatives.However, the current US Administration has signaled a change in policy with respect to climate and energy, including potential opposition to the Paris Agreement and the previous administration's Clean Policy Plan. Domestic and international response to climate and related energy issues are matters of public policy concern. We are currently in a period of increasing uncertainty as to these matters, and, at this time, it is difficult to anticipate how the new US Administration will impact existing laws and regulations, or propose new laws and regulations, and how state governments and other stakeholders may react. As compared with large multi-national, integrated energy companies, we lack the resources or expertise to conduct fundamental research regarding the scientific inquiry of climate change. However, we will continue to closely monitor all relevant developments in this regard. Changes in international, federal or state laws and regulations regarding climate policy could have a significant negative impact on our ability to explore for and develop crude oil and natural gas resources or reduce demand for our products.Provisions in our Certificate of Incorporation and Delaware law may inhibit a takeover of us. Under our Certificate of Incorporation, our Board of Directors is authorized to issue shares of our common or preferred stock without approval of our shareholders. Issuance of these shares could make it more difficult to acquire us without the approval of our Board of Directors as more shares would have to be acquired to gain control. In addition, Delaware law imposes restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15% or more of our outstanding common stock. These provisions may deter hostile takeover attempts that could result in an acquisition of us that would have been financially beneficial to our shareholders. Item1B.  Unresolved Staff Comments
