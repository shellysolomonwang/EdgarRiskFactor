Item 1A. Risk Factors—Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements of this Form 10-K.   General   Noble Energy, Inc. (Noble Energy, we or us) is a Delaware corporation, formed in 1969, that has been publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) since 1980. We are an independent energy company that has been engaged in the acquisition, exploration, development, production and marketing of crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids (NGLs) since 1932. In this report, unless otherwise indicated or where the context otherwise requires, information includes that of Noble Energy and its subsidiaries. We operate primarily in the Rocky Mountains, Mid-continent, and deepwater Gulf of Mexico areas in the US, with key international operations offshore Israel, the North Sea and West Africa.   Strategy   Our strategy is to achieve growth in earnings and cash flow through the development of a high quality portfolio of producing assets that is balanced between US and international projects. Strategic acquisitions of Patina Oil & Gas Corporation (Patina) in 2005 and U.S. Exploration Holdings, Inc. (U.S. Exploration) in 2006, along with additional capital investment in US and international locations, have resulted in substantial growth in the last several years. Acquisitions and capital investment, combined with the sale of non-core assets, have allowed us to achieve a strategic objective of enhancing our US asset portfolio, resulting in a company with assets and capabilities that include growing US basins coupled with a significant portfolio of international properties. See Item 6. Selected Financial Data for additional financial and operating information for fiscal years 2004-2008.   Proved Reserves   Proved reserves estimates at December 31, 2008 were as follows:                December 31, 2008           Proved       Proved       Total           Developed       Undeveloped       Proved           Reserves       Reserves       Reserves       United States                       Crude oil, condensate and NGLs (MMBbls)      121       77       198      Natural gas (Bcf)      1,268       591       1,859      Total US (MMBoe) (1)      332       176       508      International                             Crude oil, condensate and NGLs (MMBbls)      78       35       113      Natural gas (Bcf)      1,117       339       1,456      Total International (MMBoe) (1)      264       92       356      Worldwide                             Crude oil, condensate and NGLs (MMBbls)      199       112       311      Natural gas (Bcf)      2,385       930       3,315      Total Worldwide (MMBoe) (1) (2)      596       268       864                     (1)   Natural gas is converted on the basis of six Mcf of gas per one barrel of oil equivalent.         (2)   Approximately 69% are proved developed reserves.       Estimates of Proved Reserves – Proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids which geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions (i.e., prices and costs as of the date the estimate is made). Prices include consideration of changes in existing prices provided only by contractual arrangements, but not on escalations based upon future conditions. For additional information regarding estimates of crude oil and natural gas reserves, including estimates of proved and proved developed reserves, the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, and the changes in discounted future net cash flows, see Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates—Reserves and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Supplemental Oil and Gas Information.           1      Table of Contents       Reserve Audit – Engineers in our Houston, Denver and London offices prepare all reserve estimates for our different geographical regions. These reserve estimates are reviewed and approved by senior engineering staff and division management with final approval by the vice president in charge of corporate reserves and certain members of senior management. In each of the years 2008, 2007 and 2006, we retained Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc. (NSAI), independent third-party reserve engineers, to perform reserve audits of proved reserves. A “reserve audit”, as we use the term, is a process involving an independent third-party engineering firm’s visits, collection of any and all required geologic, geophysical, engineering and economic data, and such firm’s complete external preparation of reserve estimates. Our use of the term “reserve audit” is intended only to refer to the collective application of the procedures which NSAI was engaged to perform. The term “reserve audit” may be defined and used differently by other companies.   The reserve audit for 2008 included a detailed review of 18 of our major international, deepwater Gulf of Mexico and onshore US fields, which covered approximately 79% of US proved reserves and 97% of international proved reserves (86% of total proved reserves). The reserve audit for 2007 included a detailed review of 16 of our major international, deepwater Gulf of Mexico and onshore US fields, which covered approximately 71% of US proved reserves and 96% of international proved reserves (81% of total proved reserves). The reserve audit for 2006 included a detailed review of 14 of our major international, deepwater Gulf of Mexico and onshore US fields, which covered approximately 80% of our total proved reserves.   In connection with the 2008 reserve audit, NSAI prepared its own estimates of our proved reserves. In order to prepare its estimates of proved reserves, NSAI examined our estimates with respect to reserve quantities, future producing rates, future net revenue, and the present value of such future net revenue. NSAI also examined our estimates with respect to reserve categorization, using the definitions for proved reserves set forth in Regulation S-X Rule 4-10(a) and subsequent Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) staff interpretations and guidance. In the conduct of the reserve audit, NSAI did not independently verify the accuracy and completeness of information and data furnished by us with respect to ownership interests, oil and gas production, well test data, historical costs of operation and development, product prices, or any agreements relating to current and future operations of the fields and sales of production. However, if in the course of the examination something came to the attention of NSAI which brought into question the validity or sufficiency of any such information or data, NSAI did not rely on such information or data until it had satisfactorily resolved its questions relating thereto or had independently verified such information or data. NSAI determined that our estimates of reserves conform to the guidelines of the SEC, including the criteria of “reasonable certainty,” as it pertains to expectations about the recoverability of reserves in future years, under existing economic and operating conditions, consistent with the definition in Rule 4-10(a)(2) of Regulation S-X. NSAI issued an unqualified audit opinion on our proved reserves at December 31, 2008, based upon its evaluation. The NSAI opinion concluded that our estimates of proved reserves were, in the aggregate, reasonable and have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted petroleum engineering and evaluation principles.   The fields audited by NSAI are chosen in accordance with company guidelines and result in the audit of a minimum of 80% of our total proved reserves. The fields are chosen by senior engineering staff and division management with approval by the vice president in charge of corporate reserves and certain members of senior management, and are reviewed by the Board of Directors.   When compared on a field-by-field basis, some of our estimates are greater and some are less than the estimates of NSAI. Given the inherent uncertainties and judgments that go into estimating proved reserves, differences between internal and external estimates are to be expected. On a quantity basis, the NSAI field estimates ranged from two MMBoe above to 14 MMBoe below as compared with our estimates. On a percentage basis, the NSAI field estimates ranged from 10% above our estimates to 14% below our estimates. Differences between our estimates and those of NSAI are reviewed for accuracy but are not further analyzed unless the aggregate variance is greater than 10%. At December 31, 2008, reserves differences, in the aggregate, were less than 29 MMBoe, or 4%.   Since January 1, 2008, no crude oil or natural gas reserve information has been filed with, or included in any report to, any federal authority or agency other than the SEC and the Energy Information Administration (EIA) of the US Department of Energy. We file Form 23, including reserve and other information, with the EIA.   Recent SEC Rule-Making Activity – In December 2008, the SEC announced that it had approved revisions to modernize its oil and gas company reporting requirements. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Supplemental Oil and Gas Information.           2      Table of Contents     Acquisition and Divestiture Activities   We maintain an ongoing portfolio optimization program. Accordingly, we may engage in acquisitions of additional crude oil or natural gas properties and related assets through either direct acquisitions of the assets or acquisitions of entities owning the assets. We may also divest non-core assets in order to optimize our property portfolio.   Mid-continent Acquisition – In July 2008, we acquired producing properties in western Oklahoma for $292 million in cash. Properties acquired cover approximately 15,500 net acres and are currently producing a net 20 MMcfepd. The total purchase price has been preliminarily allocated to the proved and unproved properties acquired based on fair values at the acquisition date. Approximately $254 million was allocated to proved properties and $38 million to unproved properties.   Sale of Argentina Assets – In February 2008, we closed on the sale of our interest in Argentina for a sales price of $117.5 million, effective July 1, 2007. The gain on sale has been deferred as the sale is contingent upon approval of the Argentine government. Our crude oil reserves for Argentina totaled 7 MMBbls at December 31, 2007.   Sale of Gulf of Mexico Shelf Properties – In 2006, we sold all of our significant Gulf of Mexico shelf properties except for the Main Pass area, which required repairs related to hurricane damage at the time. As of the effective date of the sale, proved reserves for the Gulf of Mexico properties sold totaled approximately 7 MMBbls of crude oil and 110 Bcf of natural gas. Deepwater Gulf of Mexico and Gulf Coast onshore areas remain core areas and are more aligned with our long-term business strategies. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 4—Acquisitions and Divestitures.   U.S. Exploration Acquisition – In 2006, we acquired U.S. Exploration, a privately held corporation, for $412 million in cash plus liabilities assumed. U.S. Exploration’s reserves and production are located primarily in Colorado’s Wattenberg field. This acquisition significantly expanded our operations in one of our core areas. Proved reserves of U.S. Exploration at the time of acquisition were approximately 234 Bcfe, of which 38% were proved developed and 55% natural gas. Proved crude oil and natural gas properties were valued at $413 million and unproved properties were valued at $131 million. In addition, we recorded $34 million of goodwill. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 4—Acquisitions and Divestitures.   Patina Merger – In 2005, we acquired Patina through merger (Patina Merger) for a total purchase price of $4.9 billion. Patina’s long-lived crude oil and natural gas reserves provide a significant inventory of low-risk opportunities that balanced our portfolio. Patina’s proved reserves at the time of acquisition were estimated to be approximately 1.6 Tcfe, of which 72% were proved developed and 67% natural gas. Proved crude oil and natural gas properties were valued at $2.6 billion and unproved properties were valued at $1.1 billion. In addition, we recorded $875 million of goodwill.   Crude Oil and Natural Gas Properties and Activities   We search for crude oil and natural gas properties, seek to acquire exploration rights in areas of interest and conduct exploratory activities. These activities include geophysical and geological evaluation and exploratory drilling, where appropriate, on properties for which we have acquired exploration rights. Our properties consist primarily of interests in developed and undeveloped crude oil and natural gas leases and concessions. We also own natural gas processing plants and natural gas gathering and other crude oil and natural gas related pipeline systems which are primarily used in the processing and transportation of our crude oil, natural gas and NGL production.   2009 Budget   Due to the uncertain economic and commodity price environment, we have designed a flexible capital spending program that will be responsive to conditions that develop during 2009. See Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – 2009 Outlook – 2009 Budget.        United States        We have been engaged in crude oil and natural gas exploration, exploitation and development activities throughout onshore US since 1932 and in the Gulf of Mexico since 1968. The Patina Merger and the acquisition of U.S. Exploration significantly increased the breadth of our onshore operations, especially in the Rocky Mountains and Mid-continent areas. These two acquisitions, along with other acquisitions of producing and non-producing properties, have provided us with a multi-year inventory of exploitation and development opportunities. In 2008, we continued to expand our undeveloped acreage position with the leasing of approximately 502,000 net acres in Colorado, Kansas, Montana, Wyoming, East Texas and Oklahoma, along with 15 new leases in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico.   US operations accounted for 56% of our 2008 consolidated sales volumes and 59% of total proved reserves at December 31, 2008. Approximately 61% of the proved reserves are natural gas and 39% are crude oil, condensate and NGLs. Our onshore US portfolio at December 31, 2008 included 996,000 net developed acres and 1.3 million net undeveloped acres. We currently hold interests in 93 offshore blocks in the Gulf of Mexico.           3      Table of Contents       Sales of production and estimates of proved reserves for our significant US operating areas were as follows:                                                                                             Year Ended December 31, 2008       December 31, 2008           Sales Volumes       Proved Reserves           Crude Oil     Natural Gas     NGLs     Total       Crude Oil (1)     Natural Gas     Total           (MBopd)     (MMcfpd)     (MBpd)     (MBoepd)       (MMBbls)     (Bcf)     (MMBoe)       Northern Region                                     Wattenberg field    15   146   5   45     118   842   259      Piceance basin    -   39   -   7     -   263   44      Niobrara field (Tri-state area)    -   26   -   4     -   109   18      Mid-continent area    7   72   1   20     37   336   93      Other    -   25   -   4     1   122   21      Total    22   308   6   80     156   1,672   435      Southern Region                                     Deepwater Gulf of Mexico    13   49   3   24     19   64   29      Gulf Coast onshore and other    5   38   -   12     23   123   44      Total    18   87   3   36     42   187   73      Total United States    40   395   9   116     198   1,859   508                                                                                              (1)   Includes NGLs.

The Northern region also includes the Mid-continent area, consisting of properties in the Texas Panhandle, Oklahoma and Kansas. The Rocky Mountains area is one of our core operating assets. During 2008, we acquired a total of approximately 490,000 net acres in southern Montana, the Mid-continent area and the Niobrara and Wattenberg fields.   Wattenberg Field—The Wattenberg field (approximately 96% operated working interest), located in the D-J basin of north central Colorado, is our largest onshore US field and continues to grow. We acquired working interests in the Wattenberg field through the Patina Merger in 2005 and acquisition of U.S. Exploration in 2006. The Wattenberg field held 51% of our US proved reserves on December 31, 2008.   One of the most attractive features of the field is the presence of multiple productive formations, which include the Codell, Niobrara, and J-Sand formations, as well as the D-Sand, Dakota and the shallower Shannon, Sussex and Parkman formations. Drilling in the Wattenberg field is considered lower risk from the perspective of finding crude oil and natural gas reserves.   Our current field activities are focused primarily on the improved recovery of reserves through drilling new wells or deepening within existing wellbores, recompleting the Codell formation within existing J-Sand wells, refracturing or trifracturing existing Codell wells and refracturing or recompleting the Niobrara formation within existing Codell wells. A refracture consists of the restimulation of a producing formation within an existing wellbore to enhance production and add incremental reserves. A trifracture is effectively a refracture of a refracture. These projects and continued success with our production enhancement program, which includes well workovers, reactivations, and commingling of zones, allow us to increase production and add proved reserves to what is considered a mature field.               5      Table of Contents     We continue to improve efficiencies in Wattenberg field drilling and completion operations and have significantly reduced drilling time by utilizing the latest available technology, including automatic drilling rigs (ADRs). An ADR uses an automated system to regulate the drill string of a drilling rig in response to current drilling conditions, including drilling fluid pressure, bit weight, drill string torque, and drill string revolutions per minute to achieve an optimal rate of bit penetration.   In 2008, we drilled or participated in 558 Wattenberg field development wells, with a 99.8% success rate and added approximately 186 Bcfe of proved reserves approximately 59% of which were natural gas. At year-end, we were running six drilling rigs and 15 completion units in the field.   We have experienced significant growth in production from the Wattenberg field, from an average of 199 MMcfepd at year-end 2005 to approximately 268 MMcfepd at year-end 2008. Approximately 54% of 2008 production was natural gas. However, expansion of field boundaries has resulted in a 110% increase in our crude oil and NGL stream since year-end 2005. In 2008, sales of Wattenberg field production accounted for 39% of total US sales volumes.   The infrastructure in this area is improving and expanding. Oil transport alternatives should improve in 2009 with the expected start up of a new interstate crude oil transportation pipeline system which will run from Weld County, Colorado, where the Wattenberg field is located, to Cushing, Oklahoma. The pipeline, in which we own a small equity interest, will provide another option for the marketing of our crude oil. We have entered into a five-year throughput agreement with the pipeline.   We continue to acquire acreage in the area and held interests in approximately 332,000 net acres at year-end 2008. We are planning an active capital program in 2009; however, our program may decrease from 2008 levels. We will have the flexibility with short-term drilling rig contracts to decrease activity if economic conditions continue to decline. We will continue to have a strong focus on Codell/Niobrara new drills. Additionally, we have a substantial project inventory remaining and plan to continue steady refracture, trifracture, and recompletion programs in 2009.   Piceance Basin—The Piceance basin in western Colorado (approximately 93% operated working interest) is another core area for us. It is a major North American natural gas basin, characterized by low-porosity rock. The primary productive formation is the Mesaverde Williams Fork formation. Multiple wells are drilled from individual drilling pads to reduce rig mobilization costs in mountainous terrain and to minimize environmental impact on the surface area. Well spacing is approximately ten acres per well.   As in the Wattenberg field, Piceance basin drilling time per well has been reduced significantly due to our increased use of improved drilling technology. In the Piceance basin, we are using new fit-for-purpose rigs which include design innovations and technology improvements that capture incremental time savings during all phases of the well drilling process, including moving between wells. Fit-for-purpose rigs can drill multiple wells from one location and are particularly useful in developing hydrocarbon resources in tight-gas areas such as the Piceance basin.   In 2008, we increased our drilling activities and drilled or participated in 124 development wells and one exploratory well, 100% of which were successful. Our 2008 drilling activity resulted in the addition of 135 Bcfe of proved reserves. Successful drilling activity in recent years has led to significant volume growth; production has grown from 2 MMcfepd in 2005 to 53 MMcfepd at year-end 2008.   We have assembled a significant acreage position in the area and currently hold interests in approximately 19,000 net acres providing a large inventory of future projects. At this time, we plan to operate a two-rig drilling program in 2009.   Tri-State Area (Niobrara)—Our operations in the Tri-State area (eastern Colorado, extending into Kansas and Nebraska) center primarily around the development of the Niobrara Trend (approximately 88% operated working interest). The Niobrara formation is an important shallow gas producer. Since 2006, we have expanded our acreage position to over 580,000 net acres. We have a substantial future project inventory, including Niobrara infill and exploitation drilling along with gathering system and compressor station additions to develop reserves and deliver new production in 2009. We are planning an active capital program in 2009; however, our program may decrease from 2008 levels. We will have the flexibility with short-term drilling rig contracts to decrease activity if economic conditions continue to decline.   In 2008, we doubled our drilling activity and drilled or participated in 243 development wells. Increased use of 3-D seismic to optimize well locations helped increase our success rate to over 80% in 2008. Our 2008 drilling activity resulted in the addition of 35 Bcfe of proved reserves, and we were producing approximately 28 MMcfepd, net at year-end. Short-term drilling rig contracts allow flexibility for our drilling plans if economic conditions continue to decline.           6      Table of Contents     Mid-continent Area—The Mid-continent area includes properties in the Texas Panhandle, Oklahoma and Kansas. Significant areas of activity have been the Granite Wash development in the Texas Panhandle, infill drilling in several of our Oklahoma waterfloods, and deeper completions to the Skinner formation in western Oklahoma. We drilled or participated in 92 development wells in 2008, 96% of which were successful and one successful exploratory well. The potential for Granite Wash horizontal drilling is currently being evaluated, which, if successful, could increase the recovery of reserves in place and daily production rates.    In July 2008, we expanded into a new area with a 15,500 net acre acquisition in western Oklahoma, which included approximately 16 MMboe of proved reserves. The target area is the Cleveland Sandstone, a tight gas play characterized by low-permeability rock. Since acquiring the property we have drilled seven development wells (included in the well count above). There are currently 56 operated wells on the property producing in aggregate a net 20 MMcfepd. We have the flexibility of operating one to three rigs in 2009 with two rigs currently operating.   Other—We are also active in the Bowdoin field (approximately 63% operated working interest), located in north central Montana; the San Juan basin (approximately 82% operated working interest), located in northwestern New Mexico and southwestern Colorado; and the Wind River basin (approximately 74% operated working interest), located in central Wyoming. In 2008, we drilled or participated in a total of 31 development wells in these areas, 100% of which were successful. We plan to have reduced activity in these areas in 2009 as we focus most of our capital spending on the core development fields of Wattenberg, Piceance and Tri-State.   During 2008, we acquired approximately 205,000 net exploratory acres in southern Montana and plan to test the area in 2009.   Southern Region—The Southern region includes the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and onshore areas primarily in Texas, Louisiana, Illinois and Indiana. In 2006, we sold all of our significant Gulf of Mexico shelf properties except for the Main Pass area, which is currently held for sale. The sale of our shelf properties allowed us to migrate future investments and growth from the Gulf of Mexico shelf to the deepwater Gulf of Mexico which we believe is an area of higher potential.   Deepwater Gulf of Mexico—The deepwater Gulf of Mexico is one of our core areas and accounted for 21% of 2008 US sales volumes and 6% of US proved reserves at December 31, 2008. We currently hold interests in 93 deepwater Gulf of Mexico leases, representing approximately 315,000 net acres. We operate approximately 70% of the leases.          The expansion of our deepwater Gulf of Mexico program began in 2004 with the Ticonderoga discovery and the acquisition of additional ownership interests in Swordfish and Lorien. Since then we have continued to expand our operations primarily through an active exploration program, expansion of our 3-D seismic database, and lease acquisition. Our exploration activities have led to significant discoveries at Isabela and Redrock/Raton, and, most recently, Gunflint, a 2008 discovery which is our largest deepwater Gulf of Mexico discovery to date. Participation in the 2008 central Gulf of Mexico outer continental shelf sale resulted in our being awarded 15 new deepwater Gulf of Mexico leases for approximately $167 million, net to our interest, and allows us to expand our inventory with the addition of several new deepwater Gulf of Mexico prospects in the Atwater Valley, Mississippi Canyon, Green Canyon, Walker Ridge, and Garden Banks areas.            7      Table of Contents     In addition to Gunflint, 2008 exploration drilling activities included a well at the Noble-operated Tortuga prospect (Mississippi Canyon Blocks 561 and 605; 57% working interest). Although the well was successful in locating hydrocarbons, we decided not to develop the prospect due to near-term lease expiration as well as other considerations. Accordingly, we impaired the well in the fourth quarter of 2008. We also announced that an exploration well at the Stones River prospect (Mississippi Canyon Block 285; 100% working interest) did not encounter hydrocarbons in commercial quantities.   We plan to continue exploration activities in 2009 by conducting a seismic program and drilling two to three exploratory wells.   Our most significant deepwater Gulf of Mexico properties and current development plans are discussed in more detail below:   Gunflint (Mississippi Canyon Block 948; 37.5% working interest) – We originally acquired the block in the 2006 central Gulf of Mexico outer continental shelf sale and announced the Gunflint crude oil discovery, our largest deepwater Gulf of Mexico discovery to date, in October 2008. We are currently acquiring additional seismic information and preparing to drill an appraisal well in 2009 or early 2010. We are the operator of the block.   Isabela (Mississippi Canyon Block 562, 33% working interest) – Isabela was a 2007 discovery and is non-operated. Development planning is underway, Phase 1 of which is anticipated to include a producing well with a subsea tieback to an existing production facility. Initial production is currently anticipated in 2011. We also have an interest in adjacent acreage with additional exploration potential on Mississippi Canyon Blocks 519 and 563 (23.25% working interest). We are currently drilling an exploratory well on Block 519 (Santa Cruz prospect).   Redrock/Raton (Mississippi Canyon Blocks 204, 248 and 292; 66.67 % working interest) – Redrock was a 2006 natural gas/condensate discovery and Raton was a 2006 natural gas discovery. The Raton South appraisal well was also drilled during 2006. In 2007, we successfully sidetracked and completed the Raton discovery well and it was tied back and came on production in late 2008. In 2008, we drilled a successful sidetrack-appraisal well at Raton South, and tie back to a host facility is anticipated in late 2009. Redrock is currently considered a co-development candidate to the completed sidetrack well at Raton South. We are the operator of Redrock/Raton.   Swordfish (Viosca Knoll Blocks 917, 961 and 962; 85% working interest) – Swordfish was a 2001 discovery and began producing in 2005. In 2007, we drilled and completed a sidetrack to Viosca Knoll Block 917 #1 well, which began production at the end of 2007. The Swordfish project currently includes three producing wells connected to a third-party production facility through subea tiebacks. We are the operator of Swordfish.   Ticonderoga (Green Canyon block 768; 50% working interest) – Ticonderoga is a non-operated 2004 crude oil discovery and began producing in 2006. In 2007, we drilled and completed the #3 and #1 ST4 wells to extend and enhance production from the field. The wells came on line first quarter 2008. The project currently includes three producing wells connected to existing infrastructure through subea tiebacks.   Lorien (Green Canyon Block 199; 60% working interest) – Lorien was a 2003 crude oil discovery and began producing in 2006. The project currently includes two producing wells connected to existing infrastructure through subea tiebacks. We are the operator of Lorien.   In September 2008, Hurricanes Gustav and Ike moved through the Gulf of Mexico. Inspection of our facilities and equipment indicated there was no major damage from the hurricanes, although damage to third party processing and pipeline facilities has slowed reinstatement of production from our Gulf of Mexico assets, including Lorien and Ticonderoga. Approximately 8.5 MBoepd of production remained shut-in at year-end. We expect production to resume during the first half of 2009, depending on the successful resumption of pipeline and other non-operated facilities.   New Albany Shale—We continue to selectively increase our acreage position in resource plays, including shale plays. We have accumulated over 179,000 net acres in the New Albany Shale in the Illinois Basin (approximately 92% working interest), located in Indiana and Illinois. During 2008, we drilled 11 development wells, 100% of which were successful. We also drilled 12 development wells in the Paxton area, 92% of which were successful, and seven successful exploration wells on our Round Rock acreage in the Illinois Basin.           8      Table of Contents     East Texas and North Louisiana—This is an emerging area for us. Recent acquisitions have increased our leasehold acreage to approximately 17,700 net acres. In 2008, we drilled seven horizontal James Lime wells and 24 Hosston, Travis Peak and Cotton Valley wells, all of which were successful. We also participated in the drilling of one successful horizontal Haynesville shale well in North Louisiana. Our drilling program for 2009 will focus on the Haynesville shale.   Other— In addition to the East Texas and North Louisiana programs, we drilled six successful development wells within the South Central Robertson Unit in west Texas and two Gulf Coast exploratory wells.   International   International operations are significant to our business, accounting for 44% of consolidated sales volumes in 2008 and 41% of total proved reserves at December 31, 2008. International proved reserves are approximately 68% natural gas and 32% crude oil. Operations in Equatorial Guinea, Cameroon, Ecuador, China and Suriname are conducted in accordance with the terms of production sharing contracts. Operations in other foreign locations are conducted in accordance with concession agreements or licenses.   Sales of production and estimates of proved reserves for our significant international operating areas are as follows:                                                 Year Ended December 31, 2008       December 31, 2008           Sales Volumes       Proved Reserves           Crude Oil     Natural Gas     NGL's     Total       Crude Oil     Natural Gas     Total           (MBopd)     (MMcfpd)     (MBpd)     (MBoepd)       (MMBbls)     (Bcf)     (MMBoe)       International                                     West Africa    15   206   -   49     75   978   238      North Sea    10   5   -   11     23   19   27      Israel    -   139   -   23     -   273   46      Ecuador    -   22   -   4     -   180   30      China    4   -   -   4     15   6   15      Total consolidated    29   372   -   91     113   1,456   356      Equity investee    2   -   6   8                    Total    31   372   6   99     113   1,456   356      Equity investee share of methanol sales (MMgal)                119                                                                      9      Table of Contents         Wells drilled in 2008 and productive wells at December 31, 2008 in our international operating areas were as follows:                     Year Ended                 December 31, 2008       December 31, 2008           Gross Wells       Gross           Drilled/Participated in       Productive Wells       International                 West Africa      3       23      North Sea      4       26      Israel      -       6      Ecuador      -       5      China      -       15      Suriname      1       -      Total International      8       75                     West Africa (Equatorial Guinea and Cameroon)—Operations in West Africa accounted for 54% of 2008 consolidated international sales volumes and 67% of international proved reserves at December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008, we held approximately 15,000 net developed acres and 250,000 net undeveloped acres in Equatorial Guinea and 563,000 net undeveloped acres in Cameroon. In 2008, approximately 190,000 gross undeveloped acres were relinquished in Equatorial Guinea pursuant to contract terms.   We began investing in West Africa in the early 1990’s. Activities center around our 34% non-operated working interest in the Alba field, offshore Equatorial Guinea, which is one of our most significant assets. Operations include the Alba field and related production and condensate facilities, a methanol plant, and an onshore LPG processing plant (both located on Bioko Island) where additional condensate is produced. The methanol plant is capable of producing up to 3,000 MTpd gross.   We sell our share of natural gas production from the Alba field to the LPG plant, the methanol plant and an unaffiliated LNG plant. The LPG plant is owned by Alba Plant LLC (Alba Plant) in which we have a 28% interest accounted for by the equity method. The methanol plant is owned by Atlantic Methanol Production Company, LLC (AMPCO) in which we have a 45% interest accounted for by the equity method. The methanol plant purchases natural gas from the Alba field under a contract that runs through 2026. AMPCO subsequently markets the produced methanol to customers in the US and Europe. We sell our share of condensate produced in the Alba field and from the LPG plant under short-term contracts at market-based prices.   West Africa Exploration Activities — We have conducted a successful exploration and appraisal drilling program in West Africa, which centers around Blocks O and I, offshore Equatorial Guinea, and the PH-77 license, offshore Cameroon. We are the technical operator on Block O (45% working interest) and Block I (40% working interest) and the operator on the PH-77 license (50% working interest).             10      Table of Contents       Our first discovery occurred in October 2005, when we announced successful test results from the O-1 (Belinda) exploration well offshore Equatorial Guinea. In 2007, we drilled seven wells, resulting in three new discoveries and three successful appraisal wells. In 2008, we announced successful results from the I-5 Benita oil appraisal well on Block I; the Felicita, a condensate and natural gas discovery on Block O; and the Diega, a gas condensate and oil discovery on Block I. In February 2009, we announced a successful oil discovery on Block O at the Carmen prospect.   We are in the process of assessing our options to commercialize our discoveries in the region. Engineering studies are underway, and we expect to utilize a phased-in approach for development. A development plan for the Benita discovery on Block I was submitted to the Equatorial Guinean government in December 2008, and we await their approval. We anticipate sanction of the Benita project to occur in 2009, with first oil production planned for 2012. The Benita development is expected to include subsea tie-backs to a floating production, storage and offloading vessel (FPSO). We are also evaluating options for natural gas production and marketing.   North Sea—Operations in the North Sea (the Netherlands and the UK) comprise another core international asset. We have been conducting business in the North Sea since 1996 and currently have working interests in 18 licenses with working interests ranging from 7% to 40%. We are the operator of one block. The North Sea accounted for 13% of 2008 consolidated international sales volumes and 8% of international proved reserves at December 31, 2008. During 2008, we relinquished approximately 159,000 gross undeveloped acres. At December 31, 2008, we held approximately 6,000 net developed acres and 54,000 net undeveloped acres.   We produce from the Dumbarton, MacCulloch, Hanze, Cook and other fields. Most of our production is from the non-operated Dumbarton Phase I development (30% working interest) in blocks 15/20a and 15/20b in the UK sector of the North Sea. The Dumbarton development, which was completed and began production in 2007, includes a subsea tie-back to the GP III, an FPSO in which we own a 30% interest.   In 2008, we continued the development of Dumbarton (30% working interest) with Phase 2. Phase 2 involves drilling up to six new horizontal production wells and up to two water disposal wells. The first two wells in Phase 2 were brought online in 2008, increasing the total field production to approximately 40,000 Bopd, gross. With the additional two wells, Dumbarton now has seven horizontal producers and two water injection wells. Phase 2 drilling will continue into 2009. As part of the project we plan to participate in the development of the Lochranza discovery in block 15/20a (30% working interest) which includes drilling two horizontal production wells which will be tied back to the Dumbarton subsea facilities.   During 2008, we also participated in drilling the Morgan exploratory well, in the UK Central North Sea (40% working interest). The well did not contain hydrocarbons in commercial quantities.   Israel—Operations in Israel accounted for 25% of 2008 consolidated international sales volumes and 13% of international proved reserves at December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008, we held approximately 29,000 net developed acres and 807,000 net undeveloped acres located between 10 and 60 miles offshore Israel in water depths ranging from 700 feet to 5,500 feet. Our leasehold position in Israel includes one preliminary permit, two leases and three licenses. We are the operator of our Israel properties.   We have been operating in the Mediterranean Sea, offshore Israel, since 1998, and the Mari-B field (47% working interest) is one of our core international assets. The Mari-B field is the first offshore natural gas production facility in Israel and has peak field deliverability of approximately 600 MMcfpd from six wells. In 2008, we commissioned a permanent onshore receiving terminal in Ashdod for distribution of natural gas from the Mari-B field to purchasers.   Natural gas sales began in 2004 and have increased steadily as Israel’s natural gas infrastructure has developed. Average sales volumes have risen from 48 MMcfpd in 2004 to 139 MMcfpd in 2008. The Israel Electric Corporation Limited (IEC) is our largest purchaser. The IEC has continued to convert power plants to use natural gas as fuel and, in 2008, the IEC power plant at Gezer began purchasing natural gas from us. We also sell to the Bazan Oil Refinery, Delek Independent Power Production and associated desalinization plant, and a paper mill. In 2008, we entered a new five-year natural gas sales contract with Israel Chemicals Ltd, with sales expected to begin in 2009. In addition, the IEC power plant at Hagit is expected to begin purchasing natural gas from us in 2009. Imports of natural gas from Egypt to Israel began in 2008. However, there is still potential for significant new sales in the future as the Israeli infrastructure and markets continue to expand.   We are continuing exploration activities in Israel. In fourth quarter 2008, we began drilling an exploration well to test the Tamar prospect (36% working interest), offshore northern Israel, and in January 2009, we announced a very significant natural gas discovery at Tamar. In February 2009, we announced a successful test of production flow rates at Tamar as well as our plans to drill an appraisal well later in the year. We have conducted additional seismic activities in the area and are conducting a compression study at the Mari-B field.             11      Table of Contents       Other International—Other international at December 31, 2008 includes the following:   Ecuador—Operations in Ecuador accounted for 4% of 2008 consolidated international sales volumes and 8% of international proved reserves at December 31, 2008. The concession covers approximately 12,000 net developed acres and 852,000 net undeveloped acres.   We have been operating in Ecuador since 1996. We utilize natural gas from the Amistad field (offshore Ecuador) to generate electricity through a 100%-owned natural gas-fired power plant, located near the city of Machala. The Machala power plant, which began operating in 2002, is a single cycle generator with a capacity of 130 MW from twin turbines. It is the only natural gas-fired commercial power generator in Ecuador and currently one of the lowest cost producers of thermal power in the country. The Machala power plant connects to the Amistad field via a 40-mile pipeline. In 2008, power generation totaled 749 GW hours.  China — We have been engaged in exploration and development activities in China since 1996 with production beginning in 2003. We are operator for the joint operating group of the Cheng Dao Xi field (57% working interest), which is located in the shallow water of the southern Bohai Bay. In 2008, activities consisted primarily of workover operations, including installations of electric submersible pumps. China accounted for 4% of 2008 consolidated international sales volumes and 4% of international proved reserves at December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008, we held approximately 4,000 net developed acres and no undeveloped acres. The Supplemental Development Plan, which is designed to further develop the Cheng Dao Xi field through additional drilling and facilities construction, has received all necessary governmental approvals.   Suriname — Suriname, a country located on the northern coast of South America, represents a new exploration area for us. We have entered into participation agreements on non-operated Block 30 (45% working interest) and on Block 32 (100% working interest), which combined cover approximately 6.4 million net acres offshore. During 2008, we participated in the drilling of an exploratory well on the West Tapir prospect on Block 30. The well, which did not contain hydrocarbons in commercial quantities, was the first well to be drilled offshore Suriname in over 20 years and the drilling results will allow us to evaluate and improve our understanding of the basin. We will incorporate the findings into our geological and geophysical interpretations, which will influence our risk assessment of the remaining prospects.                                                                          12      Table of Contents     Sales Volumes, Price and Cost Data—Sales volumes, price and cost data are as follows:                                                    Average           Sales Volumes     Average Sales Price     Production Cost           Crude Oil     Natural Gas     NGLs     Crude Oil     Natural Gas     NGLs               MBopd (1)     MMcfpd     MBpd     Per Bbl (2)     Per Mcf (2)     Per Bbl     Per BOE (3)       Year Ended December 31, 2008                                   United States      40     395     9   $ 75.53   $ 8.12   $ 50.15   $ 10.43      West Africa (4) (5)      15     206     -     88.95     0.27     -     2.17      North Sea      10     5     -     100.56     10.54     -     14.30      Israel      -     139     -     -     3.10     -     1.07      Ecuador      -     22     -     -     -     -     -      Other International (6)      4     -     -     82.66     -     -     15.94      Total Consolidated Operations      69     767     9     82.60     5.04     50.15   $ 7.84      Equity Investee (7)      2     -     6     96.77     -     58.81            Total      71     767     15   $ 82.96   $ 5.04   $ 53.45            Year Ended December 31, 2007                                                 United States      42     412     -   $ 53.22   $ 7.51     -   $ 8.49      West Africa (4) (5)      15     132     -     71.27     0.29     -     2.89      North Sea      13     6     -     76.47     6.54     -     9.81      Israel      -     111     -     -     2.79     -     1.14      Ecuador      -     26     -     -     -     -     -      Other International (6)      7     -     -     53.69     -     -     12.06      Total Consolidated Operations      77     687     -     60.61     5.26     -   $ 6.99      Equity Investee (7)      2     -     6     74.87     -     48.87            Total      79     687     6   $ 60.94   $ 5.26   $ 48.87            Year Ended December 31, 2006                                                 United States      46     452     -   $ 50.68   $ 6.61     -   $ 8.12      West Africa (4) (5)      18     45     -     62.51     0.37     -     2.86      North Sea      4     8     -     67.43     8.00     -     10.08      Israel      -     93     -     -     2.72     -     1.60      Ecuador      -     25     -     -     -     -     -      Other International (6)      7     -     -     52.05     -     -     9.74      Total Consolidated Operations      75     623     -     54.47     5.55     -   $ 6.97      Equity Investee (7)      2     -     6     66.60     -     40.10            Total      77     623     6   $ 54.75   $ 5.55   $ 40.10                                   (1)   In 2008, volumes include the effect of crude oil sales in excess of volumes produced of 1 MBopd in West Africa. During 2007, crude oil sales volumes equaled volumes produced. In 2006, volumes include the effect of crude oil sales in excess of volumes produced of 1 MBopd in West Africa and crude oil sales less than volumes produced of 1 MBopd in other international.          (2)   Average crude oil sales prices for the US reflect reductions of $22.06 per Bbl (2008), $13.68 per Bbl (2007), and $11.41 per Bbl (2006) from hedging activities. Average crude oil sales prices for West Africa reflect reductions of $7.59 per Bbl (2008) and $2.19 per Bbl (2007) from hedging activities. We did not hedge West Africa crude oil sales in 2006. Average natural gas sales prices in the US reflect an increase of $0.23 per Mcf (2008), an increase of $1.12 per Mcf (2007), and a reduction of $0.25 per Mcf (2006) from hedging activities.           (3)   Average production costs include oil and gas operating costs, workover and repair expense, production and ad valorem taxes, and transportation expense.          (4)   Natural gas from the Alba field in Equatorial Guinea is under contract for $0.25 per MMBtu to a methanol plant, an LPG plant and an LNG plant. Sales to these plants are based on a BTU equivalent and then converted to a dry gas equivalent volume. The methanol and LPG plants are owned by affiliated entities accounted for under the equity method of accounting. The volumes produced by the LPG plant are included in the crude oil information. The price on an Mcf basis has been adjusted to reflect the Btu content of gas sales.             13      Table of Contents         (5)   Equatorial Guinea natural gas volumes include sales to the LNG plant of 163 MMcfpd for 2008 and 78 MMcfpd for 2007. There were no natural gas sales to the LNG plant before 2007.         (6)   Other International crude oil volumes include China and Argentina (through February 2008). Other International natural gas volumes include Argentina (through February 2008).         (7)   Volumes represent sales of condensate and LPG from the LPG plant in Equatorial Guinea.       Revenues from sales of crude oil and natural gas have accounted for 90% or more of consolidated revenues for each of the last three fiscal years.   At December 31, 2008, our operated properties accounted for approximately 61% of our total production. Being the operator of a property improves our ability to directly influence production levels and the timing of projects, while also enhancing our control over operating expenses and capital expenditures.   Productive Wells—The number of productive crude oil and natural gas wells in which we held an interest as of December 31, 2008 was as follows:                             Crude Oil Wells     Natural Gas Wells     Total           Gross     Net     Gross     Net     Gross     Net       United States                               Northern Region      7,567     5,853.8     4,835     3,384.6     12,402     9,238.4      Southern Region      833     796.0     252     105.7     1,085     901.7      West Africa      3     1.2     20     7.7     23     8.9      North Sea      17     3.5     9     1.2     26     4.7      Israel      -     -     6     2.8     6     2.8      Ecuador      -     -     5     5.0     5     5.0      China      14     8.0     1     0.6     15     8.6      Total      8,434     6,662.5     5,128     3,507.6     13,562     10,170.1                                                Multiple Completions      -     -     16     3.3     16     3.3                          Productive wells are producing wells and wells capable of production. A gross well is a well in which a working interest is owned. The number of gross wells is the total number of wells in which a working interest is owned. A net well is deemed to exist when the sum of fractional ownership working interests in gross wells equals one. The number of net wells is the sum of the fractional working interests owned in gross wells expressed as whole numbers and fractions thereof. Wells with multiple completions are counted as one well in the table above.   Developed and Undeveloped Acreage—Developed and undeveloped acreage (including both leases and concessions) held at December 31, 2008 was as follows:                       Developed Acreage     Undeveloped Acreage           Gross     Net     Gross     Net       United States     (in thousands)       Onshore      1,352     893     1,361     1,014      Offshore      164     103     556     300      Total United States      1,516     996     1,917     1,314                                    International                               Equatorial Guinea      45     15     618     250      Cameroon      -     -     1,125     563      North Sea (1)      48     6     266     54      Israel      62     29     1,823     807      Ecuador      12     12     852     852      China      7     4     -     -      Suriname      -     -     7,740     6,363      Other International (2)      -     -     1,830     1,142      Total International      174     66     14,254     10,031      Total Worldwide (3)      1,690     1,062     16,171     11,345                            14      Table of Contents         (1)   The North Sea includes acreage in the UK and the Netherlands. In 2008, we sold our interest in Norway acreage consisting of approximately 411,000 gross (127,000 net) undeveloped acres.         (2)   Other International includes India and Cyprus.         (3)   Approximately 258,000 gross acres (176,000 net acres) will expire in 2009, 662,000 gross acres (385,000 net acres) will expire in 2010, and 1,370,000 gross acres (1,285,000 net acres) will expire in 2011 if production is not established or we take no other action to extend the terms.       Developed acreage is comprised of leased acres that are within an area spaced by or assignable to a productive well. Undeveloped acreage is comprised of leased acres with defined remaining terms and not within an area spaced by or assignable to a productive well.   A gross acre is any leased acre in which a working interest is owned. A net acre is comprised of the total of the owned working interest(s) in a gross acre expressed in a fractional format.   Drilling Activity—The results of crude oil and natural gas wells drilled and completed for each of the last three years were as follows:                           Net Exploratory Wells     Net Development Wells           Productive     Dry     Total     Productive (1)     Dry     Total       Year Ended December 31, 2008                               United States                               Northern Region      1.0     -     1.0     837.2     42.0     879.2      Southern Region      14.6     2.0     16.6     30.9     2.0     32.9      West Africa      1.3           1.3     -     -     -      North Sea      -     0.4     0.4     0.6     0.3     0.9      Israel      -     -     -     -     -     -      Suriname      -     0.5     0.5     -     -     -      Total      16.9     2.9     19.8     868.7     44.3     913.0      Year Ended December 31, 2007                                           United States                                           Northern Region      13.9     1.9     15.8     738.0     24.5     762.5      Southern Region      0.3     2.6     2.9     19.6     3.1     22.7      West Africa      2.6     0.5     3.1     -     -     -      North Sea      0.5     -     0.5     -     -     -      Israel      -     -     -     0.4     -     0.4      Argentina (2)      -     0.1     0.1     6.7     -     6.7      Total      17.3     5.1     22.4     764.7     27.6     792.3      Year Ended December 31, 2006                                           United States                                           Northern Region      5.5     4.6     10.1     521.4     4.6     526.0      Southern Region      0.8     4.4     5.2     145.2     0.9     146.1      West Africa      -     0.4     0.4     1.8     -     1.8      North Sea      -     -     -     1.1     -     1.1      Argentina (2)      -     -     -     7.6     -     7.6      Total      6.3     9.4     15.7     677.1     5.5     682.6                            (1)   Excludes wells drilled but not yet completed.     (2) Our assets in Argentina were sold February 2008.   A productive well is an exploratory or a development well that is not a dry well. A dry well (hole) is an exploratory or a development well found to be incapable of producing either oil or gas in sufficient quantities to justify completion as an oil or gas well.   An exploratory well is a well drilled to find and produce crude oil or natural gas in an unproved area, to find a new reservoir in a field previously found to be productive of crude oil or natural gas in another reservoir, or to extend a known reservoir. A development well, for purposes of the table above and as defined in the rules and regulations of the SEC, is a well drilled within the proved area of a crude oil or natural gas reservoir to the depth of a stratigraphic horizon known to be productive. The number of wells drilled refers to the number of wells completed at any time during the respective year, regardless of when drilling was initiated. Completion refers to the installation of permanent equipment for the production of crude oil or natural gas, or in the case of a dry hole, to the reporting of abandonment to the appropriate agency.           15      Table of Contents     In addition to the wells drilled and completed in 2008 included in the table above, at December 31, 2008, we were in the process of drilling or completing 269 gross (215.4 net) wells in the Northern region of our US operations, two gross (1.2 net) onshore wells in the Southern region of our US operations, one gross (0.5 net) well in Equatorial Guinea, and one gross (0.4 net) well in Israel.   Marketing Activities—We seek opportunities to enhance the value of our US natural gas production by marketing directly to end-users and aggregating natural gas to be sold to natural gas marketers and pipelines. We also engage in the purchase and sale of third-party crude oil and natural gas production. Such third-party production may be purchased from non-operators who own working interests in our wells or from other producers’ properties in which we own no interest. We sell our natural gas production at both market-based and fixed prices. In 2008, approximately 15% of natural gas sales were made pursuant to long-term contracts under either fixed or market-based prices.   Crude oil, condensate and NGLs produced in the US and foreign locations are generally sold under short-term contracts at market-based prices adjusted for location and quality. In China, we sell crude oil into the local market under a long-term contract at market-based prices. In Israel, we sell natural gas under long-term contracts at negotiated prices. Crude oil and condensate are distributed through pipelines and by trucks or tankers to gatherers, transportation companies and refineries.   Significant Purchaser—Suncor Energy Marketing (Suncor) was the largest single non-affiliated purchaser of 2008 production and purchased our share of crude oil from the Wattenberg field in Colorado. Sales to Suncor accounted for 22% of 2008 crude oil sales, or 13% of 2008 total oil and gas sales. No other single non-affiliated purchaser accounted for 10% or more of crude oil and natural gas sales in 2008. We believe that the loss of any one purchaser would not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations since there are numerous potential purchasers of our production.   Hedging Activities—Commodity prices were volatile in 2008 and prices for crude oil and natural gas are affected by a variety of factors beyond our control. We have used derivative instruments, and expect to do so in the future, to achieve a more predictable cash flow by reducing our exposure to commodity price fluctuations. For additional information, see Item 1A. Risk Factors—Hedging transactions may limit our potential gains and Hedging transactions, receivables and cash investments expose us to counterparty credit risk, Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 6—Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.   Regulations   Government Regulation—Exploration for, and production and marketing of, crude oil and natural gas are extensively regulated at the international, federal, state and local levels. Crude oil and natural gas development and production activities are subject to various laws and regulations (and orders of regulatory bodies pursuant thereto) governing a wide variety of matters, including, among others, allowable rates of production, transportation, prevention of waste and pollution and protection of the environment. Laws affecting the crude oil and natural gas industry are under constant review for amendment or expansion and frequently increase the regulatory burden on companies. Our ability to economically produce and sell crude oil and natural gas is affected by a number of legal and regulatory factors, including federal, state and local laws and regulations in the US and laws and regulations of foreign nations. Many of these governmental bodies have issued rules and regulations that are often difficult and costly to comply with, and that carry substantial penalties for failure to comply. These laws, regulations and orders may restrict the rate of crude oil and natural gas production below the rate that would otherwise exist in the absence of such laws, regulations and orders. The regulatory burden on the crude oil and natural gas industry increases our costs of doing business and consequently affects our profitability.   Examples of US federal agencies with regulatory authority over our exploration for, and production and sale of, crude oil and natural gas include:           ·   the Bureau of Land Management and the Minerals Management Service, which under laws such as the Federal Land Policy and Management Act, Endangered Species Act, National Environmental Policy Act and Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act have certain authority over our operations on federal lands, particularly in the Rocky Mountains and deepwater Gulf of Mexico;             ·   the Environmental Protection Agency and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, which under laws such as the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, as amended, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended, the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, the Clean Air Act, the             16      Table of Contents             Clean Water Act and the Occupational Safety and Health Act have certain authority over environmental, health and safety matters affecting our operations as discussed below;             ·   the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which under laws such as the Energy Policy Act of 2005 has certain authority over the marketing and transportation of crude oil and natural gas we produce onshore and from the deepwater Gulf of Mexico;             ·   the Department of Transportation, which has certain authority over the transportation of products, equipment and personnel necessary to our US onshore and deepwater Gulf of Mexico operations; and             ·   other federal agencies with certain authority over our business, such as the Internal Revenue Service and the SEC, as well as the NYSE upon which shares of our common stock are traded.       Most of the states within which we operate have separate agencies with authority to regulate related operational and environmental matters. Examples of such regulation on the operational side include the Greater Wattenberg Area Special Well Location Rule 318A, which was adopted by the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission to address oil and gas well drilling, production, commingling and spacing in the Wattenberg field, and, more recently, the same commission’s December 10, 2008 approval of a comprehensive update to statewide rules governing oil and gas operations in Colorado. These rules will be reviewed by the Colorado legislature in its 2009 session and will become effective in the second quarter of 2009, addressing areas such as public drinking water protection, monitoring and disclosure of chemicals used in drilling operations, erosion management and environment and wildlife protection. On the environmental side, Colorado Regulation Seven and requirements for storm water management plans were adopted by the Colorado Department of Environmental Quality, under delegation from the US Environmental Protection Agency, to regulate air emissions, water protection and waste handling and disposal relating to our oil and gas exploration and production.   Some of the counties and municipalities within which we operate have adopted regulations or ordinances that impose additional restrictions on our oil and gas exploration and production. An example is Garfield County, Colorado, which provides local land and road use restrictions affecting our Piceance basin operations and requires us to post bonds to secure any restoration obligations.   Our international operations are subject to legal and regulatory oversight by energy-related ministries of our host countries, each having certain relevant energy or hydrocarbons laws. Examples of these ministries include the Ecuador Ministry of Petroleum and Mines, the Equatorial Guinea Ministry of Mines, Industry and Energy and the UK Department of Energy and Climate Change. An example of a law affecting our international operations is the UK Finance Act of 2006, which increased the income tax rate on our UK operations effective January 1, 2006.   Environmental Matters—As a developer, owner and operator of crude oil and natural gas properties, we are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign country laws and regulations relating to the discharge of materials into, and the protection of, the environment. We must take into account the cost of complying with environmental regulations in planning, designing, drilling, operating and abandoning wells. In most instances, the regulatory requirements relate to the handling and disposal of drilling and production waste products, water and air pollution control procedures, and the remediation of petroleum-product contamination. Under state and federal laws, we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes, including wastes disposed of or released by us or prior owners or operators in accordance with current laws or otherwise, to suspend or cease operations in contaminated areas, or to perform remedial well plugging operations or cleanups to prevent future contamination. The US Environmental Protection Agency and various state agencies have limited the disposal options for hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. The owner and operator of a site, and persons that treated, disposed of or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances found at a site, may be liable, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. The US Environmental Protection Agency, state environmental agencies and, in some cases, third parties are authorized to take actions in response to threats to human health or the environment and to seek to recover from responsible classes of persons the costs of such action. Furthermore, certain wastes generated by our crude oil and natural gas operations that are currently exempt from treatment as hazardous wastes may in the future be designated as hazardous wastes and, therefore, be subject to considerably more rigorous and costly operating and disposal requirements. See Item 1A. Risk Factors—We are subject to various governmental regulations and environmental risks that may cause us to incur substantial costs.   Federal and state occupational safety and health laws require us to organize information about hazardous materials used, released or produced in our operations. Certain portions of this information must be provided to employees, state and local governmental authorities and local citizens. We are also subject to the requirements and reporting set forth in federal workplace standards.   Certain state or local laws or regulations and common law may impose liabilities in addition to, or restrictions more stringent than, those described herein.           17      Table of Contents     We have made and will continue to make expenditures in our efforts to comply with environmental requirements. We do not believe that we have, to date, expended material amounts in connection with such activities or that compliance with such requirements will have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. Although such requirements do have a substantial impact on the crude oil and natural gas industry, they do not appear to affect us to any greater or lesser extent than other companies in the industry.   Competition   The crude oil and natural gas industry is highly competitive. We encounter competition from other crude oil and natural gas companies in all areas of operations, including the acquisition of seismic and lease rights on crude oil and natural gas properties and for the labor and equipment required for exploration and development of those properties. Our competitors include major integrated crude oil and natural gas companies and numerous independent crude oil and natural gas companies, individuals and drilling and income programs. Many of our competitors are large, well established companies. Such companies may be able to pay more for seismic and lease rights on crude oil and natural gas properties and exploratory prospects and to define, evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit. Our ability to acquire additional properties and to discover reserves in the future will be dependent upon our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment. See Item 1A. Risk Factors—We face significant competition and many of our competitors have resources in excess of our available resources.   Geographical Data   We have operations throughout the world and manage our operations by country. Information is grouped into five components that are all primarily in the business of crude oil, natural gas and NGL acquisition, exploration, development and production: United States, West Africa, North Sea, Israel, and Other International, Corporate and Marketing. For more information, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 15—Segment Information.   Employees   Our total number of employees increased during the year from 1,398 at December 31, 2007 to 1,571 at December 31, 2008. The 2008 year-end employee count includes 182 foreign nationals working as employees in Ecuador, China, Israel, the UK, Equatorial Guinea and Cameroon.   Offices   Our principal corporate office, including our offices for US and international operations, is located at 100 Glenborough Drive, Suite 100, Houston, Texas 77067-3610. We maintain additional offices in Ardmore, Oklahoma and Denver, Colorado and in China, Cameroon, Ecuador, Equatorial Guinea, Israel and the UK.   Title to Properties   We believe that our title to the various interests set forth above is satisfactory and consistent with generally accepted industry standards, subject to exceptions that are not so material as to detract substantially from the value of the interests or materially interfere with their use in our operations. Individual properties may be subject to burdens such as royalty, overriding royalty and other outstanding interests customary in the industry. In addition, interests may be subject to obligations or duties under applicable laws or burdens such as production payments, net profits interest, liens incident to operating agreements and for current taxes, development obligations under crude oil and natural gas leases or capital commitments under production sharing contracts or exploration licenses.

Item 1A. Risk Factors   Crude oil and natural gas prices are volatile and a substantial reduction in these prices could adversely affect our results and the price of our common stock.   Our revenues, operating results and future rate of growth depend highly upon the prices we receive for our crude oil and natural gas production. Historically, the markets for crude oil and natural gas have been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile in the future. For example, the NYMEX daily settlement price for the prompt month oil contract in 2008 ranged from a high of $145.29 per barrel to a low of $33.87 per barrel. The NYMEX daily settlement price for the prompt month natural gas contract in 2008 ranged from a high of $13.58 per MMBtu to a low of $5.29 per MMBtu. The markets and prices for crude oil and natural gas depend on factors beyond our control. These factors include demand for crude oil and natural gas, which fluctuates with changes in market and economic conditions, and other factors, including:           ·   worldwide and domestic supplies of crude oil and natural gas;             ·   actions taken by foreign oil and gas producing nations;             ·   political conditions and events (including instability or armed conflict) in crude oil or natural gas producing regions;             ·   the level of global crude oil and natural gas inventories;             ·   the price and level of foreign imports;             ·   the price and availability of alternative fuels;             ·   the availability of pipeline capacity and infrastructure;             ·   the availability of crude oil transportation and refining capacity;             ·   weather conditions;             ·   electricity dispatch;             ·   domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes; and             ·   the overall economic environment.       Significant declines in crude oil and natural gas prices for an extended period may have the following effects on our business:           ·   limiting our financial condition, liquidity, ability to finance planned capital expenditures and results of operations;             ·   reducing the amount of crude oil and natural gas that we can produce economically;             ·   causing us to delay or postpone some of our capital projects;             ·   reducing our revenues, operating income and cash flows;             ·   reducing the carrying value of our crude oil and natural gas properties; or             ·   limiting our access to sources of capital, such as equity and long-term debt.       Estimates of crude oil and natural gas reserves are not precise.   There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating crude oil and natural gas reserves and their value, including many factors that are beyond our control. Reservoir engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of crude oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner. Our reserve estimates are based on year-end commodity prices; therefore, reserve quantities will change when actual prices increase or decrease. The estimates depend on a number of factors and assumptions that may vary considerably from actual results, including:           ·   historical production from the area compared with production from other areas;             ·   the assumed effects of regulations by governmental agencies, including the impact of the SEC’s new oil and gas company reserve reporting requirements;             ·   assumptions concerning future crude oil and natural gas prices;             ·   future operating costs;             ·   severance and excise taxes;             ·   development costs; and             ·   workover and remedial costs.       For these reasons, estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of crude oil and natural gas attributable to any particular group of properties, classifications of those reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of the future net cash flows expected from them prepared by different engineers or by the same engineers but at different times may vary substantially. Accordingly, reserve estimates may be subject to upward or downward adjustment, and actual production, revenue and expenditures with respect to our reserves likely will vary, possibly materially, from estimates.              19      Table of Contents     Additionally, because some of our reserve estimates are calculated using volumetric analysis, those estimates are less reliable than the estimates based on a lengthy production history. Volumetric analysis involves estimating the volume of a reservoir based on the net feet of pay of the structure and an estimation of the area covered by the structure. In addition, realization or recognition of proved undeveloped reserves will depend on our development schedule and plans. A change in future development plans for proved undeveloped reserves could cause the discontinuation of the classification of these reserves as proved.   Failure to fund continued capital expenditures could adversely affect our properties.   Our acquisition, exploration, and development activities require substantial capital expenditures especially in the case of our active drilling programs, such as the Wattenberg field, and our significant exploration and development program in West Africa. Historically, we have funded our capital expenditures through a combination of cash flows from operations, our revolving bank credit facility and debt and equity issuances. Future cash flows are subject to a number of variables, such as the level of production from existing wells, prices of crude oil and natural gas, and our success in finding, developing and producing new reserves. If revenues were to decrease as a result of lower crude oil and natural gas prices or decreased production, and our access to capital were limited, we would have a reduced ability to replace our reserves, resulting in a decrease in production over time. If our cash flows from operations are not sufficient to meet our obligations and fund our capital budget, we may not be able to access debt, equity or other methods of financing on an economic basis to meet these requirements, particularly in the current economic environment. If we are not able to fund our capital expenditures, interests in some properties might be reduced or forfeited as a result.   The current recession could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.   The oil and gas industry is cyclical in nature and tends to reflect general economic conditions. The US and other world economies are in a recession which could last well into 2009 and beyond. The recession may lead to significant fluctuations in demand and pricing for our crude oil and natural gas production, such as the decline in commodity prices which occurred during 2008 and into 2009. Our profitability will likely be significantly affected by decreased demand and lower commodity prices. Due to lower commodity prices, we recorded asset impairment charges during fourth quarter 2008. If commodity prices continue to decline, there could be additional impairments of our operating assets or an impairment of goodwill. Our future access to capital, as well as that of our partners and contractors, could be limited due to tightening credit markets that could inhibit development of our property interests. Some of our longer term projects require significant investment and may be delayed due to capital constraints. In addition, if drilling costs decline significantly, our long-term drilling rig contracts may require us to pay rates higher than the current market. See Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Contractual Obligations for additional information on drilling rig contracts.   Our international operations may be adversely affected by economic and political developments.   We have significant international crude oil and natural gas operations compared to companies we consider to be our peers, with approximately 44% of our consolidated sales volumes in 2008 coming from international operations. These operations may be adversely affected by political and economic developments, including the following:           ·   war, terrorist acts, civil disturbances, or territorial disputes, such as may occur in regions that encompass our operations, including Ecuador, Israel and West Africa;             ·   loss of revenue, property and equipment as a result of actions taken by foreign crude oil and natural gas producing nations, such as expropriation or nationalization of assets and renegotiation, modification or nullification of existing contracts, such as may occur pursuant to the hydrocarbons law enacted in 2006 by the government of Equatorial Guinea;             ·   changes in taxation policies, such as the UK Finance Act of 2006, which increased the income tax rate on our UK operations effective January 1, 2006, and the China Petroleum Special Profits Tax enacted in 2006, which imposed an excise tax on crude oil produced in the country;             ·   laws and policies of the US and foreign jurisdictions affecting foreign investment, taxation, trade and business conduct;             ·   foreign exchange restrictions;             ·   international monetary fluctuations and changes in the relative value of the US dollar as compared with the currencies of other countries in which we conduct business, such as the UK; and             ·   other hazards arising out of foreign governmental sovereignty over areas in which we conduct operations.             20      Table of Contents     Exploration, development and production risks and natural disasters could result in liability exposure or the loss of production and revenues.   Our operations are subject to hazards and risks inherent in the drilling, production and transportation of crude oil and natural gas, including:           ·   pipeline ruptures and spills;             ·   fires;             ·   explosions, blowouts and cratering;             ·   formations with abnormal pressures;             ·   equipment malfunctions;             ·   hurricanes, such as Gustav and Ike in 2008, which could affect our operations in areas such as the Gulf Coast and deepwater Gulf of Mexico, and cyclones, which could affect our operations offshore China; and             ·   other natural disasters.       Any of these can result in loss of hydrocarbons, environmental pollution and other damage to our properties or the properties of others.   Exploration and development drilling may not result in commercially productive reserves.   We do not always encounter commercially productive reservoirs through our drilling operations. The wells we drill or participate in may not be productive and we may not recover all or any portion of our investment in those wells. The seismic data and other technologies we use do not allow us to know conclusively prior to drilling a well that crude oil or natural gas is present or may be produced economically, and area well data and other data may be limited or less-developed in some of the international areas in which we explore. The cost of drilling, completing and operating a well is often uncertain, and cost factors can adversely affect the economics of a project. Our efforts will be unprofitable if we drill dry holes or wells that are productive but do not produce enough reserves to return a profit after drilling, operating and other costs. Further, our drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors, including:           ·   unexpected drilling conditions;             ·   title problems;             ·   pressure or other irregularities in formations;             ·   equipment failures or accidents;             ·   adverse weather conditions;             ·   compliance with environmental and other governmental requirements; and             ·   increases in the cost of, or shortages or delays in the availability of, drilling rigs and equipment.       We may be unable to make attractive acquisitions or integrate acquired businesses and/or assets, and any inability to do so may disrupt our business.   One aspect of our business strategy calls for acquisitions of businesses and assets that complement or expand our current business, such as our Patina Merger and our purchase of U.S. Exploration. This may present greater risks for us than those faced by peer companies that do not consider acquisitions as a part of their business strategy. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to identify attractive acquisition opportunities. Even if we do identify attractive opportunities, we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to complete the acquisition due to capital market constraints or even if such capital is available on commercially acceptable terms. Additionally, if we acquire another business, we could have difficulty integrating its operations, systems, management and other personnel and technology with our own. These difficulties could disrupt ongoing business, distract management and employees, increase expenses and adversely affect results of operations. Even if these difficulties could be overcome, we cannot provide assurance that the anticipated benefits of any acquisition would be realized.   We are subject to various governmental regulations and environmental risks that may cause us to incur substantial costs.   From time to time, in varying degrees, political developments and federal and state laws and regulations affect our operations. In particular, price controls, taxes and other laws relating to the crude oil and natural gas industry, changes in these laws and changes in administrative regulations have affected and in the future could affect crude oil and natural gas production, operations and economics. We cannot predict how agencies or courts will interpret existing laws and regulations or the effect these adoptions and interpretations may have on our business or financial condition.   Our business is subject to laws and regulations promulgated by international, federal, state and local authorities relating to the exploration for, and the development, production and marketing of, crude oil and natural gas, as well as safety matters. Legal requirements are frequently changed and subject to interpretation and we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance with these requirements or their effect on our operations. We may be required to make significant expenditures to comply with governmental laws and regulations.              21      Table of Contents     Our operations are subject to complex international, federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations including, for example, in the case of federal laws, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, as amended, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended, the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act and the Occupational Safety and Health Act. Environmental laws and regulations change frequently and the implementation of new, or the modification of existing, laws or regulations could negatively impact our operations. The discharge of natural gas, crude oil, or other pollutants into the air, soil or water may give rise to significant liabilities on our part to the government and third parties and may require us to incur substantial costs of remediation. In addition, we may incur costs and penalties in addressing regulatory agency procedures involving instances of possible non-compliance.   Potential regulations regarding climate change could alter the way we conduct our business.   As awareness of climate change issues increases, governments around the world are beginning to address the matter. This may result in new environmental regulations that may unfavorably impact us, our suppliers, and our customers. The cost of meeting these requirements may have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.   The unavailability or high cost of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies, personnel and other oil field services could adversely affect our ability to execute our exploration and development plans on a timely basis and within our budget.   Our industry is cyclical and, from time to time, there is a shortage of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies or qualified personnel. During these periods, the costs of rigs, equipment and supplies are substantially greater and their availability may be limited, particularly in areas of high activity and demand in which we concentrate, such as the Rocky Mountains and deepwater Gulf of Mexico, and in some international locations that typically have more limited availability of equipment and personnel, such as Ecuador, Israel and West Africa. During periods of increasing levels of exploration and production in response to strong demand for crude oil and natural gas, the demand for oilfield services and the costs of these services increase. Additionally, these services may not be available on commercially reasonable terms.   We may not have enough insurance to cover all of the risks we face, which could result in significant financial exposure.   Exploration for and production of crude oil and natural gas can be hazardous, involving natural disasters and other unfortuitous events such as blowouts, cratering, fire and explosion and loss of well control which can result in damage to or destruction of wells or production facilities, injury to persons, loss of life, or damage to property and the environment. In accordance with industry practices, we maintain insurance against many, but not all, potential perils confronting our operations and in coverage amounts and deductible levels that we believe to be reasonable. Consistent with that profile, our insurance program is structured to provide us financial protection from unfavorable loss severity resulting from damages to or the loss of physical assets or loss of human life, liability claims of third parties, and business interruption (loss of production) attributed to certain assets. Although we believe the coverages and amounts of insurance carried are adequate, we may not have sufficient protection against some of the risks we face, because we chose not to insure certain risks, insurance is not available on commercially reasonable terms or actual losses exceed coverage limits. If an event occurs that is not covered by insurance or not fully protected by insured limits, it could have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.   We face significant competition and many of our competitors have resources in excess of our available resources.   We operate in the highly competitive areas of crude oil and natural gas exploration, exploitation, acquisition and production. We face intense competition from a large number of independent, technology-driven companies as well as both major and other independent crude oil and natural gas companies in a number of areas such as:           ·   seeking to acquire desirable producing properties or new leases for future exploration;             ·   marketing our crude oil and natural gas production;             ·   seeking to acquire the equipment and expertise necessary to operate and develop properties; and             ·   attracting and retaining employees with certain skills.       Many of our competitors have financial and other resources substantially in excess of those available to us. For example, in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico we compete with major integrated crude oil and natural gas companies and in international locations such as the North Sea we compete with major integrated crude oil and natural gas companies as well as state-controlled multinational companies. This highly competitive environment could have an adverse impact on our business.           22      Table of Contents     Our level of indebtedness may limit our financial flexibility.   As of December 31, 2008, we had long-term indebtedness of $2.2 billion (excluding unamortized discount), with $1.6 billion drawn under our bank credit facility. Our indebtedness represented 26% of our total book capitalization at December 31, 2008.   Our level of indebtedness affects our operations in several ways, including the following:           ·   a portion of our cash flows from operating activities must be used to service our indebtedness and is not available for other purposes;             ·   we may be at a competitive disadvantage as compared to similar companies that have less debt;             ·   the covenants contained in the agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness and future indebtedness may limit our ability to borrow additional funds, pay dividends and make certain investments and may also affect our flexibility in planning for, and reacting to, changes in the economy and in our industry;             ·   additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate or other purposes may have higher costs and more restrictive covenants;             ·   additional financing in the future is likely to have higher costs due to the negative impact of the current credit market crisis which has restricted access to the bond markets;             ·   changes in the credit ratings of our debt may negatively affect the cost, terms, conditions and availability of future financing, and lower ratings will increase the interest rate and fees we pay on our revolving credit facility; and             ·   we may be more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions.       We may incur additional debt in order to fund our acquisition, exploration and development activities. A higher level of indebtedness increases the risk that we may default on our debt obligations. Our ability to meet our debt obligations and reduce our level of indebtedness depends on future performance. General economic conditions, crude oil and natural gas prices and financial, business and other factors will affect our operations and our future performance. Many of these factors are beyond our control and we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to pay the interest on our debt, and future working capital, borrowings and equity financing may not be available to pay or refinance such debt.   Hedging transactions may limit our potential gains.   In order to manage our exposure to price risks in the marketing of our crude oil and natural gas, we enter into crude oil and natural gas price hedging arrangements with respect to a portion of our expected production. Our hedges, consisting of a series of contracts, are limited in duration, usually for periods of one to four years. While intended to reduce the effects of volatile crude oil and natural gas prices, such transactions may limit our potential gains if crude oil and natural gas prices rise over the price established by the arrangements. In trying to manage our exposure to price risk, we may end up hedging too much or too little, depending upon how our crude oil or natural gas volumes and our production mix fluctuate in the future. In addition, hedging transactions may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including instances in which our production is less than expected; there is a widening of price basis differentials between delivery points for our production and the delivery point assumed in the hedge arrangement; the counterparties to our future contracts fail to perform under the contracts; or a sudden unexpected event materially impacts crude oil or natural gas prices. We cannot assure that our hedging transactions will reduce the risk or minimize the effect of any decline in crude oil or natural gas prices.   Hedging transactions, receivables and cash investments expose us to counterparty credit risk.   Our hedging transactions also expose us to risk of financial loss if a counterparty fails to perform under a contract. To mitigate counterparty credit risk we conduct our hedging activities with a diverse group of major financial institutions. We use master agreements which allow us, in the event of default, to elect early termination of all contracts with the defaulting counterparty. If we choose to elect early termination, all asset and liability positions with the defaulting counterparty would be net settled at the time of election. We also monitor the creditworthiness of our counterparties on an ongoing basis. However, the current disruptions occurring in the financial markets could lead to sudden changes in a counterparty’s liquidity, which could impair their ability to perform under the terms of the hedging contract. We are unable to predict sudden changes in a counterparty’s creditworthiness or ability to perform. Even if we do accurately predict sudden changes, our ability to negate the risk may be limited depending upon market conditions.           23      Table of Contents     During periods of falling commodity prices, such as in late 2008, our hedge receivable positions increase, which increases our exposure. If the creditworthiness of our counterparties, which are major financial institutions, deteriorates and results in their nonperformance, we could incur a significant loss.   In addition to hedging transactions, we are exposed to risk of financial loss from trade and other receivables. We sell our crude oil, natural gas and NGLs to a variety of purchasers. Some of these parties are not as creditworthy as we are and may experience liquidity problems. Credit enhancements have been obtained from some parties in the way of parental guarantees or letters of credit, including from our largest international crude oil purchaser; however, we do not have all of our trade credit enhanced through guarantees or credit support. Nonperformance by a trade creditor could result in significant financial losses.   We have over $1.0 billion in cash and cash equivalents, including investments in US Treasury securities and short-term cash investments with major financial institutions. In response to the credit market crisis, we have shortened the duration of our investment maturities and have increased our investments in US Treasury securities. However, we are unable to predict sudden changes in solvency of our financial institutions. In the event of a bank failure, we could incur a significant loss.   Information technology systems implementation issues could disrupt our internal operations, increase our costs and adversely affect our financial results or our ability to report our financial results.   We have been in the process of implementing a new Enterprise Resource Planning software system to replace our various legacy systems. Our implementation is based on a phased approach, the first phase of which was implemented fourth quarter 2007. We implemented additional phases in 2008 and expect to implement additional phases in 2009. As a part of this effort, we are transitioning data and changing certain processes and this may be more expensive, time consuming and resource intensive than planned. Any disruptions that may occur in the implementation or operation of this system or any future systems could increase our expenses and adversely affect our ability to report in an accurate and timely manner our financial position, results of operations and cash flows and to otherwise operate our business.   Provisions in our Certificate of Incorporation and Delaware law may inhibit a takeover of us.   Under our Certificate of Incorporation, our Board of Directors is authorized to issue shares of our common or preferred stock without approval of our stockholders. Issuance of these shares could make it more difficult to acquire us without the approval of our Board of Directors as more shares would have to be acquired to gain control. In addition, Delaware law imposes restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15% or more of our outstanding common stock. These provisions may deter hostile takeover attempts that could result in an acquisition of us that would have been financially beneficial to our stockholders.
