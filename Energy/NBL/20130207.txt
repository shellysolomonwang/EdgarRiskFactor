Item 1A. Risk Factors – Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements of this Form 10-K. General Noble Energy, Inc. (Noble Energy, the Company, we or us) is a leading independent energy company engaged in worldwide oil and gas exploration and production. Founded by Lloyd Noble in 1932, we recently celebrated the 80th anniversary of our founding. Noble Energy is a Delaware corporation, incorporated in 1969, and has been publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) since 1980. We have a unique history of growth, evolving from a regional crude oil and natural gas producer to a global exploration and production company included in the S&P 500. Our purpose, Energizing the World, Bettering People's Lives®, reflects our commitment to deliver energy through crude oil and natural gas exploration and production while embracing our responsibility to be a good corporate citizen and contribute to the betterment of people's lives in the communities in which we operate. We strive to build trust through stakeholder engagement, act on our values, provide a safe work environment, lead our industry, respect our environment and care for our people and the communities where we operate. In 2012, we published our first Sustainability Report.We aim to achieve sustainable growth in value and cash flow through exploration success and the development of a high-quality, diversified and growing portfolio of assets that is balanced between US and international projects. Exploration success, along with additional capital investment in the US and in international locations such as West Africa and the Eastern Mediterranean, has resulted in a visible lineup of major development projects which positions us for substantial future reserves, production and cash flow growth. Occasional strategic acquisitions of producing and non-producing properties, combined with the periodic divestment of non-core assets, have allowed us to achieve our objective of a diversified, growing asset portfolio offering superior returns to investors. Our portfolio is diversified between short-term and long-term projects, both onshore and offshore, domestic and international. Our organization and business model is focused on sustainable, high return growth through the pursuit of material exploration opportunities which can be monetized on a competitive discovery-to-production cycle through highly capable major development project execution. Our first major offshore development project, Aseng, offshore Equatorial Guinea, began production in late 2011. We followed our success at Aseng with our second major development project, Galapagos, in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, which began commercial crude oil production in June 2012. We remain on schedule with two major development projects, Tamar, offshore Israel, and Alen, offshore Equatorial Guinea, scheduled to begin commercial production in the second and third quarters of 2013, respectively. Our ability to deliver these major development projects on schedule and budget provides a competitive and financial advantage in the industry. Onshore US assets provide a stable base of production along with growing development programs and accommodate flexible capital spending programs that can be adjusted in response to ongoing changes in the economic environment. We continue to enhance project performance through technology and operational efficiency. Our long-term offshore development projects, while requiring multi-year capital investment, are expected to offer superior financial returns and cash flow coupled with sustained production. Our portfolio offers a diverse production mix among crude oil, US natural gas, and international natural gas. We have operations in five core areas: •the DJ Basin (onshore US);•the Marcellus Shale (onshore US);•the deepwater Gulf of Mexico (offshore US);•offshore West Africa; and•offshore Eastern Mediterranean.4Table of Contents These five core areas provide: •the majority of our crude oil and natural gas production;•visible growth from major development projects; and•numerous exploration opportunities.Our growth is supported by a strong balance sheet and liquidity levels. We strive to deliver competitive returns and a growing dividend. Our cash dividends have increased 38% in the last five years, from 66 cents per share in 2008 to 91 cents per share in 2012. See Item 5. Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities - Stock Performance Graph and Item 6. Selected Financial Data for additional financial and operating information for fiscal years 2008-2012.In this report, unless otherwise indicated or where the context otherwise requires, information includes that of Noble Energy and its subsidiaries. All references to production, sales volumes and reserves quantities are net to our interest unless otherwise indicated.Major Development Project Inventory We are moving forward on a number of major development projects, many of which have resulted from our exploration success. Each project will progress, as appropriate, through the various development phases including appraisal and development drilling, front-end engineering and design, construction and exploitation. We currently have projects in all phases of the development cycle with some contributing production growth in 2012 and 2013, and others we are working to sanction with final investment decisions targeting first production from 2015 and beyond. Although these projects will require significant capital investments over the next several years, they typically offer long-life, sustained cash flows after investment and attractive financial returns. Our major development projects resulting from exploration success and strategic acquisitions include the following: Sanctioned ProjectsUnsanctioned Projects    ·Horizontal Niobrara (onshore US)·Gunflint (deepwater Gulf of Mexico)·Marcellus Shale (onshore US)·Big Bend (deepwater Gulf of Mexico)·Tamar (offshore Israel)·Leviathan (offshore Israel)·Alen (offshore Equatorial Guinea)·Cyprus (offshore Cyprus)  ·Carla and Diega (offshore Equatorial Guinea)  ·West Africa gas project (offshore Equatorial Guinea)These projects are discussed in more detail in the sections below.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Operating Outlook – Major Development Project Inventory.5Table of Contents Proved Oil and Gas Reserves Proved reserves at December 31, 2012 were as follows: Summary of 2012 Oil and Gas Reserves as of Fiscal-Year EndBased on Average 2012 Fiscal-Year Prices   December 31, 2012  Proved Reserves  Crude Oil,Condensate& NGLs Natural Gas TotalReserves Category (MMBbls) (Bcf) (MMBoe)Proved Developed      United States 130 1,042 303Equatorial Guinea 60 514 146Israel — 18 3Other International (1) 8 8 9Total Proved Developed Reserves 198 1,582 461Proved Undeveloped      United States 114 945 272Equatorial Guinea 40 204 74Israel 3 2,232 375Other International (1) 2 1 2Total Proved Undeveloped Reserves 159 3,382 723Total Proved Reserves 357 4,964 1,184 (1) Other international includes the North Sea and China.Total proved reserves as of December 31, 2012 were approximately 1.2 BBoe, a 2% decrease from 2011. US proved reserves accounted for 49% of the total, and international proved reserves accounted for 51%. Our 2012 proved reserves mix is 30% global liquids, 42% international natural gas, and 28% US natural gas. See Proved Reserves Disclosures, below, and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Supplemental Oil and Gas Information (Unaudited) for further discussion of proved reserves. Crude Oil and Natural Gas Properties and Activities We search for crude oil and natural gas properties onshore and offshore, and seek to acquire exploration rights and conduct exploration activities in areas of interest. These activities include geophysical and geological evaluation and exploratory drilling, where appropriate. Our properties consist primarily of interests in developed and undeveloped crude oil and natural gas leases and concessions. We also own natural gas processing plants and natural gas gathering and other crude oil and natural gas-related pipeline systems which are primarily used in the processing and transportation of our crude oil, natural gas and NGL production. Exploration Activities We primarily focus on organic growth from exploration and development drilling, concentrating on basins or plays where we have strategic competitive advantages, such as proprietary seismic data and operational expertise, and which we believe generate superior returns. We have had substantial exploration success onshore US and in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, the Douala Basin offshore West Africa and the Levant Basin offshore Eastern Mediterranean, resulting in our significant portfolio of major development projects. We have numerous exploration opportunities remaining in these areas and are also engaged in new venture activity in both the US and international locations. Our focus on exploration activities has created a sustainable industry-leading exploration program. During 2012, we expanded our global presence by entering into three new areas, onshore Northeast Nevada, offshore Falkland Islands and offshore Sierra Leone. Appraisal, Development and Exploitation Activities Our exploration success and strategic acquisitions have provided us with numerous appraisal, development, and exploitation opportunities, as demonstrated in our growing inventory of major development projects. In 2012, we commenced crude oil production from Galapagos, deepwater Gulf of Mexico, our second major offshore development project, brought online following the start up of Aseng in 2011. Additionally, we continued to make significant progress on our other major development projects. 6Table of Contents Acquisition and Divestiture Activities We maintain an ongoing portfolio management program. Accordingly, we may engage in acquisitions of additional crude oil or natural gas properties and related assets through either direct acquisitions of the assets or acquisitions of entities owning the assets. We may also periodically divest non-core, non-strategic assets in order to optimize our asset portfolio.Strategic Partner for Leviathan The Leviathan field, offshore Israel, is the largest conventional natural gas discovery in our history, with resources sufficient for both domestic demand and export. During 2012, we and our existing partners in the Leviathan project commenced a process to identify a partner who could provide technical and financial support as well as midstream and downstream expertise. On December 2, 2012, we and our existing partners announced that we had agreed in principle on a proposal to sell a 30% working interest in the Leviathan licenses to Woodside Energy Ltd. (Woodside). Woodside is Australia's largest producer of LNG with over 25 years of experience and has strong working relationships with many potential customers in the Asian LNG markets. We expect to execute a final agreement with Woodside during the first half of 2013. See Eastern Mediterranean (Israel and Cyprus) - Woodside Agreement, below.Non-Core Divestiture Program Our non-core divestiture program is designed to generate organizational and operational efficiencies as well as cash for use in our capital investment program. Divestitures of non-core properties allow us to allocate capital and employee resources to high-growth, superior return areas. Proceeds from divestitures provide additional flexibility in the implementation of our international exploration and development programs and the acceleration of horizontal drilling activities in the DJ Basin and Marcellus Shale. During 2012, divestitures generated net proceeds of approximately $1.2 billion. On August 13, 2012, we sold our 30% non-operated working interests in the Dumbarton and Lochranza fields, located in the UK sector of the North Sea, for $117 million, after final closing adjustments from the January 1, 2012 effective date. Net daily production from these properties was approximately 5 MBoe/d at the time of the sale.  During the third quarter of 2012, we closed on three sales of onshore US properties in Kansas, western Oklahoma, western Texas, and the Texas Panhandle for total proceeds of $1.0 billion. The properties included our interests in about 1,400 producing wells on approximately 109,000 net acres. As of the effective date, April 1, 2012, net daily production on these properties was approximately 12.5 MBoe/d. We sold approximately 57 MMBoe of proved reserves in 2012 and continue to market packages of non-core onshore US properties and our remaining North Sea properties. Entry into Falkland Islands Joint Venture In August 2012, we entered into an agreement with Falkland Oil and Gas Limited (FOGL) and subsequently acquired an interest in FOGL's extensive license areas consisting of approximately 10 million undeveloped acres, gross, located south and east of the Falkland Islands.Entry into Sierra Leone In September 2012, the Government of Sierra Leone awarded us participation in two offshore exploration blocks, SL 8A-10 and SL 8B-10, covering almost 1.4 million acres, gross. Under the terms of the award, Chevron (SL) Ltd. will be the operator and we will have a non-operated 30% working interest.Exit from Senegal/Guinea-Bissau In 2012, we decided not to continue to participate in further appraisal activities and relinquished our acreage.Exit from Ecuador In May 2011, we transferred our assets in Ecuador to the Ecuadorian government. We received cash proceeds of $73 million for the transfer of our offshore Amistad field assets, onshore gas processing facilities, Block 3 PSC and the assignment of the Machala Power electricity concession and its associated assets. Our net book value for the assets had been reduced due to previous impairment charges, resulting in a pre-tax gain of $25 million.Entry into Marcellus Shale Joint Venture On September 30, 2011, we entered into an agreement with a subsidiary of CONSOL Energy Inc. (CONSOL) to jointly develop oil and gas assets in the Marcellus Shale areas of southwest Pennsylvania and northwest West Virginia. The Marcellus Shale joint venture strengthens and diversifies our portfolio, providing a new, material growth area, which we believe will contribute to future reserves, production, and cash flows. This transaction complements and further strengthens our US portfolio by adding a high-quality asset, with substantial growth potential that is close to the US’s largest gas market, the Northeast US. It significantly increases our inventory of low risk, repeatable development projects while exposing us to more US unconventional resources. The Marcellus Shale joint venture, combined with our other domestic projects in the DJ Basin and the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, provides diversity to our rapidly expanding international programs.7Table of Contents DJ Basin Asset Acquisition In March 2010, we acquired substantially all of the US Rocky Mountain oil and gas assets of Petro-Canada Resources (USA) Inc. and Suncor Energy (Natural Gas) America Inc. for a total purchase price of $498 million. The acquisition included properties located in the DJ Basin, one of our core operating areas. Onshore US Sale In August 2010, we closed the sale of non-core assets in the Mid-Continent and Illinois Basin areas for cash proceeds of $552 million and recorded a gain of $110 million. See Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 3. Acquisitions and Divestitures.  Asset Impairments During 2012, we recorded impairment charges of $104 million, related to our South Raton and Piceance developments due to near-term declines in crude oil and natural gas prices, respectively, and our Mari-B, Pinnacles and Noa fields, offshore Israel, due to end-of-field life declines in production. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 4. Asset Impairments.United States We have been engaged in crude oil and natural gas exploration, exploitation and development activities throughout onshore US since 1932 and in the Gulf of Mexico since 1968. US operations accounted for 60% of 2012 total consolidated sales volumes and 49% of total proved reserves at December 31, 2012. Approximately 58% of the proved reserves are natural gas and 42% are crude oil, condensate and NGLs. Sales of production and estimates of proved reserves for our US operating areas were as follows:   Year Ended December 31, 2012 December 31, 2012  Sales Volumes Proved Reserves  Crude Oil &Condensate NaturalGas NGLs Total Crude Oil &Condensate NaturalGas NGLs Total  (MBbl/d) (MMcf/d) (MBbl/d) (MBoe/d) (MMBbls) (Bcf) (MMBbls) (MMBoe)Wattenberg 32 194 13 77 150 880 61 358Marcellus Shale — 90 — 15 — 827 8 146Rockies 2 117 2 24 — 203 3 37Deepwater Gulf of Mexico 14 14 1 18 19 21 — 23Gulf Coast and Other 1 23 — 5 3 56 — 11Total 49 438 16 139 172 1,987 72 575 Wells drilled in 2012 and productive wells at December 31, 2012 for our US operating areas were as follows:   Year Ended December 31, 2012 December 31, 2012  Gross Wells Drilledor Participated in (1) Gross ProductiveWellsWattenberg 555 8,954Marcellus Shale 71 173Rockies 24 4,210Deepwater Gulf of Mexico 1 11Gulf Coast and Other — 313Total 651 13,661(1) Excludes exploratory wells drilled and suspended awaiting a sanctioned development plan or being evaluated to assess the economic viability of the well. See Drilling Activity below.8Table of Contents  Locations of our onshore US operations as of December 31, 2012 are shown on the map below:DJ Basin / Wattenberg The DJ Basin, where we have an acreage position of approximately 750,000 net acres, is a premier US crude oil resource play and is significant to our production growth and development activities. Included in the DJ Basin is Wattenberg (approximately 95% operated working interest), our largest onshore US asset, where we have a multi-year project inventory. In 2012, we continued to improve our operational performance while accelerating our drilling activities. During 2012, we had record sales volumes in the DJ Basin due to continued strong performance from our horizontal drilling program that began in 2010. Wattenberg includes: •the Greater Wattenberg Area (GWA), where we have conducted substantial vertical development over the last several years as well as successful horizontal drilling in the high density area and more recently in the less developed northeastern part of GWA. The area is comprised of both an expanding crude oil window to the northeast and strong natural gas window in the core and to the southwest; and•northern Colorado from the edge of the GWA to the Wyoming border where we expanded our acreage position and drilled over 25 wells during 2012.During 2012, we spud a total of 410 development wells in Wattenberg, of which 195 were horizontal wells into the Niobrara and Codell formations. In 2011, we began constructing multi-well horizontal drilling pads and centralized production facilities to minimize our surface use (EcoNode). The EcoNode allows for more efficient execution and operations by reducing our land use and surface traffic, water usage and moving the program forward with less surface impact. We continue to evaluate impacts of changes in well spacing and pad design. Included in the well numbers above, we spud 10 extended-reach (7,000 - 9,000 feet) lateral wells as part of the 2012 drilling program and are planning for approximately 20% of our 2013 drilling program to be extended-reach wells.Wattenberg contributed an average of 77 MBoe/d of sales volumes, represented approximately 33% of total consolidated sales volumes in 2012, with approximately 58% being liquids, and approximately 358 MMBoe or 31% of total proved reserves at December 31, 2012. Horizontal drilling in the Niobrara formation has significantly expanded the economic limits of this field. Of the net sales volumes from Wattenberg, approximately 28 MBoe/d, came from a total of 279 producing wells in our horizontal Niobrara program. During 2012, we continued to expand our horizontal Niobrara development activities into Northern Colorado, where recent results indicate recoveries comparable to those in the GWA. We added almost 26,000 net acres to our Northern Colorado position this year, increasing our acreage position to approximately 230,000 net acres. We expect to spud approximately 80 to 90 wells in this area during 2013, further accelerating our horizontal Niobrara development. 9Table of Contents Our 2012 Wattenberg development program resulted in additions to proved reserves of approximately 55 MMBoe, approximately 72% of which are liquids.Our DJ Basin position gives us opportunities to expand beyond our GWA development activities. We have also expanded into Wyoming and continue to appraise this acreage.Marcellus Shale A joint venture partnership with CONSOL Energy Inc. (CONSOL), formed in September 2011, the Marcellus Shale represents our second onshore US core area. We hold a 50% interest in approximately 628,000 net acres in southwest Pennsylvania and northwest West Virginia. We operate the wet gas development area while CONSOL operates the dry gas development area. During 2012, we drilled to total depths approximately 25 wet gas wells and began wet gas production in July 2012. By applying our DJ Basin experience, we continue to test the limits of our recovery techniques with longer lateral wells, improved hydraulic fracturing design and optimal well placements. As we move into new areas, water supply and gas gathering infrastructure are expanding. Our partner, CONSOL, drilled to total depths 64 dry gas wells during 2012. Although we have reduced drilling in the dry gas area due to the low natural gas price environment, the dry gas portion of the program continues to deliver economically attractive returns due to strong production performance, high net revenue interests, competitive costs, partner alignment, and access to the US's largest gas market in the Northeast.The Marcellus Shale contributed an average of 15 MBoe/d of sales volumes and represented approximately 6% of total consolidated sales volumes in 2012, with approximately 1% being liquids, and approximately 146 MMBoe or 12% of total proved reserves at December 31, 2012.Our joint development plan for 2013 projects that we will drill to total depth approximately 90 horizontal wells in the wet gas areas and CONSOL will drill to total depth approximately 36 horizontal wells focused in the dry gas areas of the Marcellus Shale.The large portion of acreage that is currently held by production should allow for efficient development utilizing pad drilling. Pad drilling minimizes our surface use as well as the permitting and infrastructure requirements. Hydraulic Fracturing We find that the use of hydraulic fracturing is necessary to produce commercial quantities of crude oil and natural gas from many reservoirs, including the DJ Basin and the Marcellus Shale. Hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of a mixture of pressurized water, sand and a small amount of chemicals into rock formations in order to stimulate production of natural gas and/or oil from dense subsurface rock formations, including shale. The majority of our onshore US proved undeveloped reserves, which totaled 265 MMBoe at December 31, 2012, will require the use of hydraulic fracturing to produce commercial quantities of crude oil and natural gas. See Hydraulic Fracturing, below, for more discussion.Natural Gas Flaring  The practice of natural gas flaring (burning) is the safest way to dispose of natural gas associated with crude oil production when no gas infrastructure is available. The volume of natural gas being flared is growing in certain areas of the US, such as the Bakken Shale, primarily as a result of increased oil shale drilling activity and limited natural gas infrastructure. In these areas, public concern has grown about the potential impact of GHG emissions from flaring on the environment, as well as the potential waste of natural resources.In our DJ Basin and Marcellus Shale operations, natural gas infrastructure build out generally occurs in advance of drilling activity. If short-term flaring is necessary, we use efficient, environmentally protective and energy-saving flaring technologies. We participate in the Carbon Disclosure Project by publicly disclosing, on a voluntary basis, information pertaining to our GHG emissions.Northeast Nevada We constantly strive to identify new onshore exploration opportunities with reasonable entry cost, significant running room and the potential to become a new core area. We have a 350,000 net acre position (66% fee acreage and remainder federal acreage) in Northeast Nevada, prospective for oil exploration, which we identified through basin scale reconnaissance and innovative geoscience concepts. We acquired 3-D seismic over portions of the acreage in 2012 with a vertical well exploratory drilling program scheduled to begin in 2013. Other Onshore Properties We also operate in the following onshore US areas: Rocky Mountains including Piceance Basin (Western Colorado), Bowdoin field (North Central Montana), Tri-State field (Northeastern Colorado, Northwestern Kansas and Southwestern Nebraska), San Juan Basin (Northwestern New Mexico), and Powder River Basin (North/Central Wyoming); and Gulf Coast including the Haynesville field (East Texas and North Louisiana) and other properties in Texas and Louisiana. Other onshore properties accounted for 13% of total consolidated sales volumes in 2012 and 4% of total proved reserves at December 31, 2012. Although our future development focus is concentrated on our core areas, we continue to produce and develop in these other areas. We drilled 22 development wells during 2012. During 2012, we completed the sale of various 10Table of Contents non-core onshore properties and continue to evaluate the divestment opportunities associated with other non-core properties. See Acquisition and Divestiture Activities - Non-Core Divestiture Program above.Deepwater Gulf of Mexico Locations of our deepwater Gulf of Mexico developments as of December 31, 2012 are shown on the map below: Noble Energy was one of the first independent producers to explore in the Gulf of Mexico. We acquired our first offshore block in 1968, and today the deepwater Gulf of Mexico is one of our core operating areas. Our focus is on high-impact opportunities with the potential to provide significant medium and long-term growth. We have six producing fields, multiple ongoing development projects and a substantial inventory of exploration opportunities. The deepwater Gulf of Mexico accounted for 8% of total consolidated sales volumes in 2012 and 2% of total proved reserves at December 31, 2012. We currently hold leases on 102 deepwater Gulf of Mexico blocks, representing approximately 596,000 gross acres (414,000 net acres). Of our total gross acres, approximately 96,000 gross acres (41,000 net acres) have been developed. We are the operator on approximately 86% of our leases. See also Developed and Undeveloped Acreage - Future Acreage Expirations, below. Deepwater Gulf of Mexico Exploration Program Our deepwater Gulf of Mexico operations resulted from lease acquisition, expansion of our 3-D seismic database, and an active drilling program. We currently have an inventory of 31 identified prospects, which are a combination of both high impact stand-alone subsalt prospects and smaller, high value tie-back opportunities. The prospects are subject to an ongoing rigorous technical maturation process and may or may not emerge as drillable options. To support the future exploration, appraisal, and development work, we have the ENSCO 8501 rig under contract through most of 2013 with four additional one year option elections. We also have the ENSCO 8505 rig under contract through 2014 in a rig share agreement with two other operators; however, we farmed out our 2013 drilling slot to our rig partners. In 2013, we plan to drill a Gunflint appraisal well and at least one exploration well.Big Bend During 2012, we drilled the successful Big Bend exploration well. The well is located in Mississippi Canyon Block 698 and was drilled to a total depth of 15,989 feet. We hold a 54% operated working interest in Big Bend. Logging results identified approximately 150 feet of net oil pay in two high-quality reservoirs. We anticipate sanctioning a development plan for Big Bend during 2013 with first production targeted in late 2015 or early 2016. Our most significant deepwater Gulf of Mexico properties and current development plans are discussed in more detail below.Galapagos Development Project including Isabela (Mississippi Canyon Block 562; 33.33% non-operated working interest), Santa Cruz (Mississippi Canyon Blocks 519/563; 23.25% operated working interest) and Santiago (Mississippi Canyon Block 519; 23.25% operated working interest) The Galapagos crude oil development project consists of Isabela, a 2007 discovery, Santa Cruz, a 2009 discovery, and Santiago, a 2011 discovery. During 2012, we completed the subsea tieback to the nearby Nakika production platform and began production in June. The Galapagos development has significantly increased our offshore production in 2012 with flow rates up to approximately 13.5 MBoe/d, net. 11Table of Contents Gunflint (Mississippi Canyon Block 948; 26% operated working interest) Gunflint is a 2008 crude oil discovery, our largest deepwater Gulf of Mexico discovery to date. In July 2012, we drilled a successful Gunflint appraisal well. During first quarter of 2013, we plan to drill our second appraisal well targeting the southern area of the reservoir. Front-end conceptual studies have been completed, and we are working toward sanctioning of a scalable development project in 2013. We are currently targeting 2017 for production start-up utilizing a standalone facility. If we choose to connect to an existing third-party host, the project could have an accelerated completion schedule.Raton/South Raton (Mississippi Canyon Blocks 248 and 292) Raton (67% operated working interest) was a 2006 natural gas discovery and has been producing since 2008. South Raton (79% operated working interest) was a 2008 crude oil discovery. During the second quarter of 2012, the South Raton crude oil development project commenced production at approximately 3 MBbl/d, net. South Raton is tied back to a non-operated host facility. We are currently evaluating mechanical issues at South Raton, which is temporarily offline. Swordfish (Viosca Knoll Blocks 917, 961 and 962; 85% operated working interest) Swordfish was a 2001 crude oil discovery and began producing in 2005. The Swordfish project currently includes two producing wells connected to a third-party production facility through subsea tiebacks. Ticonderoga (Green Canyon Block 768; 50% non-operated working interest) Ticonderoga is a 2004 crude oil discovery and began producing in 2006. The project currently includes three producing wells connected to existing infrastructure through subsea tiebacks. Lorien (Green Canyon Block 199; 60% operated working interest) Lorien was a 2003 crude oil discovery and began producing in 2006. The project currently includes one producing well connected to existing infrastructure through subea tiebacks.International Our international business focuses on offshore opportunities in multiple countries and provides diversity to our portfolio. Development projects in Equatorial Guinea, Israel, the North Sea, and China have contributed substantially to our growth over the last decade.Significant recent exploration successes offshore West Africa, Israel and Cyprus have identified multiple major development projects that are expected to contribute to production growth in the future. We have large acreage positions in West Africa, the Eastern Mediterranean, and in 2012 we entered two new areas: offshore the Falkland Islands and offshore Sierra Leone. Each of these locations will provide further international exploration opportunities. In furtherance of our commitment to global offshore exploration and development, on September 27, 2012, we announced that we have entered into a 36-month drilling services contract with a subsidiary of Atwood Oceanics, Inc. Drilling services will be provided by a new-build drillship, the Atwood Advantage. The Atwood Advantage is currently under construction by Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering Co., Ltd. in South Korea. The drillship will be equipped with enhanced offline capabilities, such as dual blowout preventer stacks that allow for simultaneous inspection and drilling activities, and will be rated for operations in 12,000 feet water depth/40,000 feet drill depth. The increased mobility of the Atwood Advantage, as compared with other drilling rigs, will add flexibility to our global exploration program. We expect that the drillship will be available fourth quarter 2013 and initially deployed offshore Israel.International operations accounted for 40% of total consolidated sales volumes in 2012 and 51% of total proved reserves at December 31, 2012. International proved reserves are approximately 81% natural gas and 19% crude oil and condensate. Operations in China, Cyprus, Equatorial Guinea, and Sierra Leone are conducted in accordance with the terms of PSCs. In Cameroon, we operate in accordance with the terms of a PSC and a mining concession. Operations in Nicaragua, the Falkland Islands, the North Sea, Israel, and other foreign locations are conducted in accordance with concession agreements, permits or licenses.12Table of Contents Locations of our international operations are shown on the map below:Sales volumes and estimates of proved reserves for our international operating areas were as follows:   Year Ended December 31, 2012 December 31, 2012  Sales Volumes Proved Reserves  Crude Oil &Condensate Natural Gas NGLs Total Crude Oil,Condensate& NGLs NaturalGas Total  (MBbl/d) (MMcf/d) (MBbl/d) (MBoe/d) (MMBbls) (Bcf) (MMBoe)International              Equatorial Guinea 33 235 — 72 100 718 220Israel — 101 — 17 3 2,250 378China 4 — — 4 7 2 7Total International 37 336 — 93 110 2,970 605Equity Investee 2 — 5 7 — — —Discontinued Operations (North Sea) 5 4 — 5 3 7 4Total 44 340 5 105 113 2,977 609Equity Investee Share of Methanol Sales (MMgal)   156      13Table of Contents Wells drilled in 2012 and productive wells at December 31, 2012 in our international operating areas were as follows:  Year Ended December 31, 2012 December 31, 2012  Gross Wells Drilledor Participated in (1) Gross ProductiveWellsInternational    Equatorial Guinea 4 23Cameroon 1 —Israel 8 9North Sea — 18China 3 28Total International 16 78(1) Excludes exploratory wells drilled and suspended awaiting a sanctioned development plan or being evaluated to assess the economic viability of the well. See Drilling Activity below.West Africa (Equatorial Guinea, Cameroon and Sierra Leone)  West Africa is one of our core operating areas and includes the Alba field, Block O and Block I offshore Equatorial Guinea, as well as the YoYo mining concession and Tilapia PSC offshore Cameroon and two new blocks offshore Sierra Leone. Equatorial Guinea, the only producing country in our West Africa segment, accounted for approximately 31% of 2012 total consolidated sales volumes and 18% of total proved reserves at December 31, 2012. At December 31, 2012, we held approximately 119,000 net developed acres and 80,000 net undeveloped acres in Equatorial Guinea, 542,000 net undeveloped acres in Cameroon, and 414,000 net undeveloped acres in Sierra Leone.Locations of our operations in West Africa are shown on the map below:Aseng Project   Aseng is a crude oil development project on Block I (38% operated working interest) which includes five horizontal wells flowing to an FPSO (Aseng FPSO) where the production stream is separated. The oil is stored on the Aseng FPSO until sold, while the natural gas and water are reinjected into the reservoir to maintain pressure and maximize oil recoveries. We are the technical operator of the Aseng Project and have executed a crude oil sale, purchase, and marketing agreement with Glencore Energy UK Ltd. for our share of Aseng production. 14Table of Contents The Aseng FPSO is designed to act as an oil production hub, as well as liquids storage and offloading hub, with capabilities to support future subsea oil field developments in the area. It also has the ability to process and store stabilized condensate from gas condensate fields in the area, the first of which will be Alen during the third quarter of 2013. It is capable of processing 120 MBbl/d of liquids, including 80 MBbl/d of oil, and reinjecting 160 MMcf/d of natural gas. The Aseng FPSO has storage capacity of approximately 1.6 MMBbls of liquids. During 2012, Aseng maintained excellent reliability and safety performance and averaged almost 100% production uptime, while producing on average 62 MBbl/d, 21 MBbl/d net, to Noble Energy.Alba Field  We have a 34% non-operated working interest in the Alba field, offshore Equatorial Guinea, which has been producing since 1991. Operations include the Alba field and related production and condensate storage facilities, an LPG processing plant where additional condensate is extracted along with LPGs, and a methanol plant capable of producing up to 3,100 metric tons per day, gross. The LPG processing plant and the methanol plant are located on Bioko Island, Equatorial Guinea. We sell our share of natural gas production from the Alba field to the LPG plant, the methanol plant and an unaffiliated LNG plant. The LPG plant is owned by Alba Plant LLC (Alba Plant), in which we have a 28% interest accounted for as an equity method investment. The methanol plant is owned by Atlantic Methanol Production Company, LLC (AMPCO), in which we have a 45% interest, also accounted for as an equity method investment. AMPCO purchases natural gas from the Alba field under a contract that runs through 2026 and subsequently markets the produced methanol primarily to customers in the US and Europe. Alba Plant sells its LPG products and condensate at our marine terminal at prevailing market prices. We sell our share of condensate produced in the Alba field under short-term contracts at market-based prices. In December 2012, the Alba compression project was approved. We are beginning the engineering phase for a compression platform and related in-field connections in early 2013 with an estimated start-up in 2016. Alen Project Alen, sanctioned in 2010, is located primarily on Block O (45% operated working interest), offshore Equatorial Guinea, and is our next West Africa major development project. Initial field development will include three production wells and three subsea natural gas injection wells tied to a processing facility. Produced condensate will be separated and piped to the Aseng FPSO utilizing the hub we are in the process of building in the region, where it will be held until sold. The associated natural gas will be reinjected into the reservoir to maintain pressure and maximize liquids recovery. The Alen facilities are designed to process up to 440 MMcf/d of natural gas and 40 MBbl/d of condensate. We are the technical operator of the Alen Project.Alen is progressing ahead of schedule and below budget. The total gross development cost is trending below sanction cost of $1.4 billion with first production currently expected during the third quarter of 2013 at 18 MBbl/d, net. The sanctioned plan originally scheduled commencement late fourth quarter of 2013. Significant effort has been placed to remove the risk from the schedule by completing as much of the field work as possible early in development. The wells are drilled and completed, the well-protector and jacket are installed, and the flowlines are in place. The final infrastructure, the topsides for the well-protector platform and the central platform, are expected to arrive in West Africa late March 2013 to begin installation. Other Block O & I Projects We are continuing our exploration and appraisal efforts offshore Equatorial Guinea, where we still have numerous opportunities. We continue the appraisal program for our Carla and Diega discoveries, where we have encountered hydrocarbons in multiple appraisal wells and side-tracks. During 2012, we identified a crude oil reservoir below the Alen field while drilling additional Carla appraisal wells. Development plans are being prepared for possible sanctioning of Carla during 2013, which would have a target first production at 11 MBbl/d, net, in early 2016. Carla further demonstrates the value of the infrastructure we are building that allows us to have host facilities and tie back additional fields. We are continuing to review drilling results from our Diega discovery wells, finalizing an appraisal design program, and continue to evaluate regional development scenarios for the asset. We plan to begin appraisal drilling in the second half of 2013 or early 2014.West Africa Gas Project We have a natural gas development team working with the Equatorial Guinea Ministry of Mines, Industry and Energy in evaluating several monetization options for natural gas that would be produced from Blocks O and I. Cameroon We have an interest in over one million gross acres offshore Cameroon, which include the YoYo mining concession and Tilapia PSC. We are the operator (50% working interest) in Cameroon. Natural gas and condensate were discovered in 2007 when we drilled the YoYo-1 exploratory well. During 2012, we drilled the Trema exploration well testing the Tilapia Block, offshore Cameroon, but did not locate commercial quantities of hydrocarbons. We are currently evaluating prospects as a follow-up for our offshore Cameroon exploration program. 15Table of Contents Sierra Leone During 2012, the Government of Sierra Leone awarded us participation in two offshore exploration blocks, SL 8A-10 and SL 8B-10, covering almost 1.4 million gross acres. Under the terms of the award, Chevron (SL) Ltd. will be the operator and we will have a non-operated 30% working interest. We plan to begin acquiring 2-D seismic information over portions of the acreage in 2013 to assist with our 3-D seismic plans. See Item 1A. Risk Factors - Our entry into new exploration ventures in areas in which we have no prior experience subjects us to additional risks.Senegal/Guinea-Bissau During 2011, we farmed into the AGC Profond block (30% non-operated working interest) and the joint venture drilled the Kora-1 exploration well. The well did not result in commercial quantities of hydrocarbons. During 2012, we decided not to participate in the second appraisal period and relinquished our acreage. The cost associated with the undeveloped leasehold was charged to exploration expense in third quarter 2012.Eastern Mediterranean (Israel and Cyprus) Another core operating area is located in the Eastern Mediterranean, where we have had six consecutive natural gas discoveries in recent years. We are also beginning to explore for potential thermogenic (crude oil generating) hydrocarbon systems which may exist at greater depths.Israel, the only producing country in our Eastern Mediterranean segment, accounted for 7% of 2012 total consolidated sales volumes and 32% of total proved reserves at December 31, 2012. At December 31, 2012, we held approximately 58,000 net developed acres and 581,000 net undeveloped acres located between 10 and 90 miles offshore Israel in water depths ranging from 700 feet to 6,500 feet. Our leasehold position in Israel includes four leases and 13 licenses, and we are the operator of the properties. We also hold a license covering approximately 596,000 net undeveloped acres offshore Cyprus adjacent to our Israel acreage. Locations of our operations in the Eastern Mediterranean are shown below: Domestic Natural Gas Demand   As the Israeli economy continues to grow, so does the demand for natural gas, which is currently used primarily for electricity generation. Demand for natural gas in the industrial sector, including refineries, chemical, desalination, cement and other plants, is also increasing. These sectors are gaining confidence that a long-term supply 16Table of Contents of natural gas will be available and are therefore willing to make the capital investment necessary to convert facilities to use natural gas. We expect that government requirements for emissions reductions could also drive demand for natural gas as fuel.Natural Gas Export   As discussed below, we have made significant natural gas discoveries in the Eastern Mediterranean. Although we continue to conduct appraisal activities, we expect that the quantity of natural gas discovered can be used to satisfy growing domestic demand as well as provide sufficient resources for export. Eastern Mediterranean export projects would be well positioned to supply growing global natural gas demand, and, as discussed further below, we are considering multiple options. The government of Israel is in the process of finalizing an export policy. See Regulations - Israeli Interministerial Committee, below.Tamar Natural Gas Project We discovered the Tamar natural gas field (36% operated working interest), offshore Israel, in the Levant Basin in 2009. Tamar is one of the world's largest offshore conventional gas discoveries in recent years and is currently one of our major development projects. We expect first delivery of gas to customers in April 2013, four years from discovery and two and a half years from project sanction. Tamar Phase 1 development includes five subsea wells with a combined production capacity of 985 MMcf/d, with identified expansion capability to approximately 1.5 Bcf/d. The natural gas produced at these wells will flow to a new offshore platform constructed near the existing Mari-B platform. The natural gas will then be delivered to the existing pipeline that connects the Mari-B field to the Ashdod onshore terminal. Tamar's 93-mile tieback, originating in a water depth in excess of 5,000 feet, is the longest subsea tieback in the world.The Tamar partners have executed numerous gas sale and purchase agreements (Tamar GSPAs) for the initial and expanded capacity as well as a condensate sales agreement. See International Marketing Activities and Delivery Commitments below. In addition, a floating LNG (FLNG) project is under evaluation. Leviathan Natural Gas Project In December 2010, we announced a significant natural gas discovery at the Leviathan-1 well (39.66% operated working interest) offshore Israel in the Levant Basin. The Leviathan field is the largest discovery in our history and was the world's largest offshore natural gas discovery in 2010. The Leviathan-2 well was plugged due to wellbore issues. In 2012, we drilled the successful Leviathan-3 appraisal well and spud the Leviathan-4 appraisal well.We have project and commercial teams in place and are in the process of screening multiple development concepts. Due to Leviathan's size, full field development and realization of maximum economic value is expected to require several development phases. The Leviathan Phase 1 development concept includes offshore processing at an FPSO, with a production capacity of 1.6 Bcf/d and a capability to serve both domestic demand and export. Domestic production could begin as early as 2016. This option will enable us to begin production within three years of license to lease conversion. Phase 2, an additional FPSO, is expected to have a similar production capacity and capability. Multiple export options, including onshore LNG, FLNG and pipeline are under evaluation. Timing of project sanction depends on execution of natural gas sales contracts, determination of an onshore entry point and government approvals.Woodside Agreement  On December 2, 2012, we and our existing partners in the Leviathan project announced that we had agreed in principle on a proposal to sell a 30% working interest in the Leviathan licenses to Woodside Energy Ltd. Each of the current Leviathan partners is expected to participate as a seller to Woodside. We expect to convey a 9.66% working interest, reducing our working interest to 30%, and continue as upstream operator. The transaction is subject to the negotiations and execution of definitive agreements between the parties, as well as customary approvals, prior to closing. According to the initial proposal, we would receive net cash payments totaling $464 million, a portion of which would be paid only upon the occurrence of certain future events. The payments, subject to definitive agreement, include the following:•$287 million initial cash payment payable at closing; •$64 million contingent on the ability to export natural gas; and •$113 million contingent on a final investment decision for an LNG project. 17Table of Contents Additional payments, subject to definitive agreement, would include the following:•a share of Woodside's annual LNG revenue above certain price parameters, subject to a $322 million cap over the life of the project; and•a drilling carry of up to $16 million on the drilling of the planned Mesozoic oil exploration well. Including the potential revenue sharing amounts and drilling carry, the implied price for our 9.66% working interest being sold totals $802 million under the initial proposal. Negotiations continue, and, as a result, this amount could change. We expect to execute a final agreement with Woodside during the first half of 2013. In conjunction with these negotiations, we are assisting our current Leviathan partners to obtain appropriate financing for their share of development costs and considering providing a limited amount of financial backstop to them.Leviathan-1 Deep (Mesozoic Oil Target)   In January 2012, we returned to the Leviathan-1 well and began drilling toward two deeper intervals in order to evaluate them for the existence of crude oil (Leviathan-1 Deep). In May 2012, due to high well pressure and the mechanical limits of the wellbore design, we suspended drilling operations. Although the well did not reach the planned objective, we are encouraged by the possibility of an active thermogenic (crude oil generating) hydrocarbon system at greater depths within the basin. We will integrate the data from the Leviathan-1 Deep well into our model to update our analysis and design a drilling plan specifically to test the deep oil concept. We have entered into a contract for drilling services to be provided by the Atwood Advantage drillship, which will be rated for operations in 12,000 feet water depth/40,000 feet drill depth with the capabilities necessary to reach the target objective, and plan to begin drilling an exploratory well in the fourth quarter of 2013.Mari-B, Pinnacles and Noa Fields    The Mari-B field (47% operated working interest) was the first offshore natural gas production facility in Israel and has been producing since 2004. Through December 31, 2012, we have delivered over 420 Bcf of natural gas, net, to Israeli customers. During 2011, due to multiple interruptions in imported gas supplies from Egypt, Mari-B natural gas volumes were delivered at very high rates to support Israel's growing natural gas and power demands. As a result, the Mari-B field experienced accelerated depletion. In January 2012, we announced a cut back in production at Mari-B to prudently manage the reservoir. We have been working closely with our Israeli customers to manage demand on the Mari-B field and continue production from it. In order to help meet Israeli natural gas demand until the Tamar field begins producing, we completed the Noa (47% operated working interest) and Pinnacles (47% operated working interest) wells and tied them back to the Mari-B platform. We began selling natural gas from Noa in June 2012 and Pinnacles in July 2012. At December 31, 2012, we recorded an impairment charge of $31 million for the combined Mari-B, Noa, and Pinnacles wells due to end-of-field life declines in production. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Financial Data - Note 4. Asset Impairments.We expect to continue producing from Mari-B, Noa and Pinnacles until production commences at the Tamar field. Once Tamar begins producing, Mari-B, Noa and Pinnacles production volumes will be reduced, and we plan to transition the Mari-B reservoir to a natural gas storage facility. We will continue to provide natural gas to Israeli purchasers under several natural gas sales and purchase agreements for which the total contract quantities have not been met. See Delivery Commitments and Item 1A. Risk Factors - Exploration, development and production risks and natural disasters could result in liability exposure or the loss of production and revenues. Other Discoveries Offshore Israel We and our partners are working on a development plan for the Dalit field (36% operated working interest), a 2009 natural gas discovery. Development would include tie-in to the Tamar platform, and we have submitted a development plan to the Israeli government. In addition, we are reviewing alternatives for the development of the Dolphin (39.66% operated working interest) and Tanin 1 (47.06% operated working interest) natural gas discoveries.Cyprus  During the fourth quarter of 2011, we made another natural gas discovery when we drilled the successful A-1 exploration well in Block 12, offshore Cyprus. We are planning to drill an appraisal well in 2013 and are working with the government of Cyprus on a domestic supply project as well as a potential LNG project. The Turkish government has voiced opposition to our drilling operations. However, the US and the European Union have expressed support for Cyprus' right to explore offshore for hydrocarbons in its exclusive economic zone.Risks Although we will be able to incorporate major development project execution gained on the Aseng and Tamar projects to Leviathan or other LNG projects, such complex, costly projects as discussed above are not without financial or execution risk. See item 1A. Risk Factors - The magnitude of our offshore Eastern Mediterranean discoveries will present financial and technical challenges for us due to the large-scale development requirements and Failure of our partners to fund their share of 18Table of Contents development costs or obtain project financing could result in delay or cancellation of future projects, thus limiting our growth and future cash flows.See also Item 1A. Risk Factors - Our international operations may be adversely affected by economic and political developments and Our operations may be adversely affected by violent acts such as from civil disturbances, terrorist acts, regime changes, cross-border violence, war, piracy, or other conflicts that may occur in regions that encompass our operations. Other InternationalOur other international operations accounted for 2% of our total consolidated sales volumes for 2012 and 1% of total proved reserves at December 31, 2012.Falkland Islands In August 2012, we entered into an agreement with Falkland Oil and Gas Limited (FOGL) to acquire an interest in FOGL's extensive license areas, consisting of approximately 10 million acres, gross, located south and east of the Falkland Islands. The Falkland Islands are located in the South Atlantic Ocean approximately 400 miles from the South America mainland. The agreement was approved by the Falkland Islands Government in October 2012. Under the agreement we have farmed-in to the Northern and Southern Area Licenses for a 35% working interest. FOGL will continue as operator until we assume operatorship of the Northern Area License in March 2013 and the Southern Area License no later than March 2014. Our financial contribution includes 60% of the costs of two commitment wells and a $25 million cash contribution paid in January 2013. We may also elect to participate in a discretionary exploration well, paying 45% of the costs in return for a 35% working interest. We expect to invest approximately $180 to $230 million over the next three years. During fourth quarter 2012, FOGL drilled the Scotia exploration well, which reached its Cretaceous objective in November 2012 and encountered 40 feet of net pay. We are encouraged by the well results. Although we did not see a substantial amount of the reservoir section, virtually all sandstones with significant porosity in and below the target contained hydrocarbons. We are currently evaluating the well results and have begun acquiring 3D seismic over the Northern and Southern Area licenses. The integration of these activities will allow us to assess the economic viability of this prospect. The Scotia well has been plugged in accordance with the regulations of the Falkland Islands Department of Mineral Resources, which require all exploration wells, including successful ones, to be plugged.See Acquisition and Divestiture Activities - Entry into Falkland Islands Joint Venture and Item 1A. Risk Factors - Our entry into new exploration ventures in areas in which we have no prior experience subjects us to additional risks.Nicaragua We continue to evaluate our undeveloped acreage and currently plan to spud our first exploration well (Paraiso), targeting a crude oil play, in the second half of 2013. A 3D seismic survey and further technical work have clarified this prospect and helped to decrease the risk. We are currently seeking a partner in this prospect, anticipating a working interest farmout by the time we spud the first exploration well.China  We have been engaged in exploration and development activities in China since 1996 under the terms of a PSC, expiring in 2018. We are currently negotiating for an extension beyond 2018. We have a 57% non-operated working interest in the Cheng Dao Xi (CDX) field, which is located in the shallow water of the southern Bohai Bay.North Sea We have been conducting business in the North Sea (the Netherlands and the United Kingdom (UK)) since 1996. During 2012, we sold our 30% non-operated working interests in the Dumbarton and Lochranza fields, located in the UK sector of the North Sea. Also during the fourth quarter of 2012, the nearby Bligh well, a potential co-development candidate for our Selkirk discovery, was drilled. Bligh encountered hydrocarbons but disappointingly tight non-commercial reservoirs. Therefore, we determined that the Selkirk field was uneconomic for joint development and wrote it off to exploration expense. Our remaining North Sea assets are included in assets held for sale in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2012, and the North Sea geographical segment has been reported as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Financial Data - Note 3. Acquisitions and Divestitures.Proved Reserves Disclosures Internal Controls Over Reserves Estimates   Our policies regarding internal controls over the recording of reserves estimates require reserves to be in compliance with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) definitions and guidance and prepared 19Table of Contents in accordance with Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Engineers. Our internal controls over reserves estimates also include the following: •the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors reviews significant reserves changes on an annual basis;•each field representing more than 1% of total proved reserves, as well as a selection of smaller fields, which combined represent over 80% of our proved reserves, are audited by Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc. (NSAI), a third-party petroleum consulting firm, on an annual basis; and•NSAI is engaged by and has direct access to the Audit Committee. See Third-Party Reserves Audit, below.In addition, our Company-wide short-term incentive plan does not include quantitative targets for proved reserves additions. Responsibility for compliance in reserves estimation is delegated to our Corporate Reservoir Engineering group. Qualified petroleum engineers in our Houston and Denver offices prepare all reserves estimates for our different geographical regions. These reserves estimates are reviewed and approved by regional management and senior engineering staff with final approval by the Vice President – Strategic Planning, Environmental Analysis & Reserves (Vice President – Reserves) and certain members of senior management. Our Vice President – Reserves is the technical person primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of our reserves estimates. Our Vice President – Reserves has a Bachelor of Science degree in Engineering and over 25 years of industry experience with positions of increasing responsibility in engineering and evaluations. The Vice President – Reserves reports directly to our Chief Executive Officer. Technologies Used in Reserves Estimation The SEC’s reserves rules expanded the technologies that a company can use to establish reserves. The SEC now allows use of techniques that have been proved effective by actual production from projects in the same reservoir or an analogous reservoir or by other evidence using reliable technology that establishes reasonable certainty. Reliable technology is a grouping of one or more technologies (including computational methods) that has been field tested and has been demonstrated to provide reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability in the formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation. We used a combination of production and pressure performance, wireline wellbore measurements, simulation studies, offset analogies, seismic data and interpretation, wireline formation tests, geophysical logs and core data to calculate our reserves estimates, including the material additions to the 2012 reserves estimates. Third-Party Reserves Audit  In each of the years 2012, 2011, and 2010, we retained NSAI to perform reserves audits of proved reserves. The reserves audit for 2012 included a detailed review of eight of our major onshore US, deepwater Gulf of Mexico and international fields, which covered approximately 87% of US proved reserves and 98% of international proved reserves (93% of total proved reserves). The reserves audit for 2011 included a detailed review of 14 of our major fields and covered approximately 90% of total proved reserves. The reserves audit for 2010 included a detailed review of 13 of our major fields and covered approximately 88% of total proved reserves.In connection with the 2012 reserves audit, NSAI prepared its own estimates of our proved reserves. In order to prepare its estimates of proved reserves, NSAI examined our estimates with respect to reserves quantities, future production rates, future net revenue, and the present value of such future net revenue. NSAI also examined our estimates with respect to reserves categorization, using the definitions for proved reserves set forth in Regulation S-X Rule 4-10(a) and subsequent SEC staff interpretations and guidance. In the conduct of the reserves audit, NSAI did not independently verify the accuracy and completeness of information and data furnished by us with respect to ownership interests, oil and gas production, well test data, historical costs of operation and development, product prices, or any agreements relating to current and future operations of the fields and sales of production. However, if in the course of the examination something came to the attention of NSAI which brought into question the validity or sufficiency of any such information or data, NSAI did not rely on such information or data until it had satisfactorily resolved its questions relating thereto or had independently verified such information or data. NSAI determined that our estimates of reserves have been prepared in accordance with the definitions and regulations of the SEC, including the criteria of “reasonable certainty,” as it pertains to expectations about the recoverability of reserves in future years, under existing economic and operating conditions, consistent with the definition in Rule 4-10(a)(24) of Regulation S-X. NSAI issued an unqualified audit opinion on our proved reserves at December 31, 2012, based upon their evaluation. NSAI concluded that our estimates of proved reserves were, in the aggregate, reasonable and have been prepared in accordance with 20Table of Contents Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Engineers. NSAI’s report is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The fields audited by NSAI are chosen in accordance with Company guidelines and result in the audit of a minimum of 80% of our total proved reserves. The fields are chosen by the Vice President – Reserves and are reviewed by senior management and the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. Our practice is to select fields for audit based on size. This process results in the audit of each field representing more than 1% of total proved reserves, as well as a selection of smaller fields. The Tamar and Alen fields were first audited in 2010, and the Marcellus Shale field was first audited in 2011, as no reserves had been recorded in prior years. When compared on a field-by-field basis, some of our estimates are greater and some are less than the estimates of NSAI. Given the inherent uncertainties and judgments that go into estimating proved reserves, differences between internal and external estimates are to be expected. For proved reserves at December 31, 2012, on a quantity basis, the NSAI field estimates ranged from 26 MMBoe or 18% above to 1 MMBoe or 2% below as compared with our estimates on a field-by-field basis. Differences between our estimates and those of NSAI are reviewed for accuracy but are not further analyzed unless the aggregate variance is greater than 10%. Reserves differences at December 31, 2012 were, in the aggregate, approximately 48 MMBoe, or 4%. Proved Undeveloped Reserves (PUDs)  As of December 31, 2012, our PUDs totaled 159 MMBbls of crude oil, condensate and NGLs and 3,382 Bcf of natural gas, for a total of 723 MMBoe. PUDs Locations We have several significant ongoing development projects which are in various stages of completion. PUDs are located as follows at December 31, 2012: •372 MMBoe in the Tamar field, offshore Israel, which will begin converting to proved developed at first production, currently expected in second quarter 2013; •158 MMBoe in the DJ Basin, including Wattenberg, consisting of 958 horizontal Niobrara locations, which is equivalent to less than three years of drilling based on current plans;•106 MMBoe in the Marcellus Shale, consisting of 290 horizontal locations, which is equivalent to less than three years of drilling based on current plans;•74 MMBoe in Equatorial Guinea, 64% of which are in the Alba field with the remainder in the Alen field. The Alba reserves, which will be recovered from existing wells with a sanctioned compression project, will be reclassified to proved developed at start-up, currently expected in 2016. The Alen PUDs will be reclassified to proved developed at start-up, currently expected in 2013;•the above fields represent 98% of total PUDs. The remaining 2% is associated with ongoing developments in various areas scheduled in the next five years; and •PUDs include no material amounts which have remained undeveloped for five years or more.Changes in PUDs Changes in PUDs that occurred during the year were due to:•recording of 135 MMBoe in the DJ Basin horizontal Niobrara program; •partially offset by negative revisions of 94 MMBoe in the DJ Basin due to our decision to terminate the legacy vertical drilling program and focus capital and drilling rigs on the horizontal development of the Niobrara;•recording of 51 MMBoe in the Marcellus Shale as a result of an ongoing development program with expansion into the wet gas area of the play;•recording of an additional 7 MMBoe at Tamar as a result of ongoing appraisal work, plus 1 MMBoe from other international areas;•conversion of 82 MMBoe into proved developed reserves, primarily related to ongoing development in the DJ Basin (19% of year-end 2011 PUDs converted) and Marcellus Shale (22% of year-end 2011 PUDs converted), the start-up of the Galapagos project in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, and a pipeline pressure-reduction project in Equatorial Guinea;•the sale of 3 MMBoe from our non-core asset divestiture program;•positive revisions of 10 MMBoe, primarily due to increased recovery assumptions in the Marcellus Shale as a result of better than expected performance from existing wells; and•negative revisions of 7 MMBoe, primarily in the Marcellus Shale, due to changes in commodity prices.Development Costs Costs incurred to advance the development of PUDs were approximately $1.8 billion in 2012, $1.4 billion in 2011 (including $66 million non-cash costs related to an increase in our Aseng FPSO lease obligation), and $1.1 billion in 2010 (including $266 million non-cash costs related to an increase in our Aseng FPSO lease obligation). A significant portion 21Table of Contents of costs incurred in 2012 related to our major development projects, horizontal Niobrara, Marcellus Shale, Alen and Tamar, which will be converted to proved developed reserves in future years. Estimated future development costs relating to the development of PUDs are projected to be approximately $1.8 billion in 2013, $1.5 billion in 2014, and $1.1 billion in 2015. Estimated future development costs include capital spending on major development projects, some of which will take several years to complete. Proved undeveloped reserves related to major development projects will be reclassified to proved developed reserves when production commences. Drilling Plans All PUD drilling locations are scheduled to be drilled prior to the end of 2017. PUDs associated with projects other than drilling (such as compression projects) are also expected to be converted to proved developed reserves prior to the end of 2017. Initial production from these PUDs is expected to begin during the years 2013 - 2017. For more information see the following: •Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Proved Reserves for a discussion of changes in proved reserves;•Item 7.

Sales to these plants are based on a Btu equivalent and then converted to a dry gas equivalent volume. The methanol and LPG plants are owned by affiliated entities accounted for under the equity method of accounting. The volumes produced by the LPG plant are included in the crude oil information.(3) Volumes represent sales of condensate and LPG from the LPG plant in Equatorial Guinea.(4) Average crude oil sales prices reflect reductions of $1.32 per Bbl for 2010 from hedging activities. Average natural gas sales prices reflect a decrease of $0.01 per Mcf for 2010 from hedging activities. This price reduction resulted from losses that were previously deferred in AOCL. All hedge losses relating to US production had been reclassified to revenues by December 31, 2010.(5) Includes sales volumes through November 24, 2010. Our Block 3 PSC was terminated by the Ecuadorian government on November 25, 2010. Intercompany natural gas sales were eliminated for accounting purposes. Electricity sales are included in other revenues. See Exit from Ecuador above.Revenues from sales of crude oil, natural gas and NGLs have accounted for 90% or more of consolidated revenues for each of the last three fiscal years. At December 31, 2012, our operated properties accounted for approximately 72% of our total production. Being the operator of a property improves our ability to directly influence production levels and the timing of projects, while also enhancing our control over operating expenses and capital expenditures.Productive Wells The number of productive crude oil and natural gas wells in which we held an interest at December 31, 2012 was as follows:   Crude Oil Wells Natural Gas Wells Total  Gross Net Gross Net Gross NetUnited States 6,943 6,118.6 6,718 5,083.7 13,661 11,202.3Equatorial Guinea 5 2.0 18 6.7 23 8.7Israel — — 9 3.7 9 3.7North Sea 9 1.2 9 1.1 18 2.3China 27 15.4 1 0.6 28 16.0Total 6,984 6,137.2 6,755 5,095.8 13,739 11,233.0 Productive wells are producing wells and wells mechanically capable of production. A gross well is a well in which a working interest is owned. The number of gross wells is the total number of wells in which a working interest is owned. The number of net wells is the sum of the fractional working interests owned in gross wells expressed as whole numbers and fractions thereof.

We are currently planning to drill an appraisal well in 2013. The result of this well will assist us in the evaluation of our acreage.(4) The acreage in Cameroon is comprised of our Tilapia PSC and YoYo mining concession. Pursuant to the Tilapia PSC, our first exploration period expires on July 6, 2013; however, we have the right to extend our acreage for two additional periods of two years each. Pursuant to our YoYo mining concession, development must commence prior to December 2014; we are actively engaged in negotiations to extend the term of the mining concession to 35 years.Drilling Activity The results of crude oil and natural gas wells drilled and completed for each of the last three years were as follows:   Net Exploratory Wells Net Development Wells    Productive Dry Total Productive Dry Total TotalYear Ended December 31, 2012              United States  8.1 2.3 10.4 457.5 — 457.5 467.9Equatorial Guinea  — — — 2.3 — 2.3 2.3Cameroon — 0.5 0.5 — — — 0.5Israel  — — — 3.2 — 3.2 3.2China — — — 1.7 — 1.7 1.7Total 8.1 2.8 10.9 464.7 — 464.7 475.6Year Ended December 31, 2011              United States  9.6 3.7 13.3 641.2 4.0 645.2 658.5Equatorial Guinea  — — — 0.5 — 0.5 0.5Cameroon — 0.5 0.5 — — — 0.5Senegal/Guinea-Bissau — 0.3 0.3 — — — 0.3China — — — 2.9 — 2.9 2.9Total 9.6 4.5 14.1 644.6 4.0 648.6 662.7Year Ended December 31, 2010              United States  4.8 1.9 6.7 510.6 1.0 511.6 518.3Equatorial Guinea  — — — 2.0 — 2.0 2.0Israel  — — — 1.0 — 1.0 1.0North Sea — — — 0.6 — 0.6 0.6China — — — 2.3 — 2.3 2.3Total 4.8 1.9 6.7 516.5 1.0 517.5 524.2 In addition to the wells drilled and completed in 2012 included in the table above, wells that were in the process of drilling or completing at December 31, 2012 were as follows:   Exploratory (1) Development Total  Gross Net Gross Net Gross NetUnited States  13 8.1 172 88.0 185 96.1Cameroon  1 0.5 — — 1 0.5Cyprus  1 0.7 — — 1 0.7Equatorial Guinea  8 4.0 — — 8 4.0Falkland Islands  1 0.4 — — 1 0.4Israel  6 2.5   6 2.5Total 30 16.2 172 88.0 202 104.2(1) Includes exploratory wells drilled and suspended awaiting a sanctioned development plan or being evaluated to assess the economic viability of the well.

On behalf of its membership, CGA has contracted with Helix Energy Solutions Group (HESG) for the provision of subsea intervention, containment, capture and shut-in capacity for deepwater Gulf of Mexico exploration wells. The system, known as the Helix Fast Response System (HFRS), at full production capacity, can contain well leaks up to 55 MBbl/d of oil, 70 MBbl/d of liquids and 95 MMcf/d of natural gas, at 10,000 pounds per square inch (psi) in water depths to 10,000 feet. Resources also include a 15,000 psi-gauge intervention capping stack designed to shut-in wells in water depths to 10,000 feet, including extremely high-pressure, deeper wells in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. We have entered into a separate utilization agreement with HESG which specifies the asset day rates should the HFRS system be deployed. Internationally, we maintain membership in Oil Spill Response Limited (OSRL). OSRL is an industry owned cooperative which exists to ensure effective response to oil spills wherever they occur. OSRL is an industry leader in oil spill preparedness and response services. We also maintain agreements internationally with Seacor. Seacor provides leased response equipment as well as oil spill response services. Additionally, in Equatorial Guinea, we are members of the Oil and Gas Operators Emergency Resource Allocation Group which shares equipment and resources in the event of a spill.Domestic Marketing Activities Crude oil, natural gas, condensate and NGLs produced in the US are generally sold under short-term and long-term contracts at market-based prices adjusted for location and quality. Crude oil and condensate are distributed through pipelines and by trucks and rail cars to gatherers, transportation companies and refineries.International Marketing Activities Our share of crude oil and condensate from the Aseng field is sold to Glencore Energy UK Ltd (Glencore Energy) under a long-term sales contract at market rates and is transported by tanker. Natural gas from the Alba field is sold under a long-term contract for $0.25 per MMBtu to a methanol plant, an LPG plant and an LNG plant. The methanol and LPG plants are owned by affiliated entities accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Our share of crude oil and condensate from the Alba field is sold to Glencore Energy under a short-term sales contract, subject to renewal, and is transported by tanker. In Israel, we sell natural gas from the Mari-B, Noa and Pinnacles fields, and have contracted to sell natural gas from the the Tamar field, under long-term contracts. See Delivery Commitments below. Our North Sea crude oil production is transported by tanker and sold on the spot market. In China, we sell crude oil into the local market through pipelines under a long-term contract at market-based prices.Delivery Commitments Some of our natural gas sales contracts specify the delivery of fixed and determinable quantities. Mari-B GSPAs We currently sell natural gas from the Mari-B, Noa and Pinnacles fields to several customers, including Israel Electric Corporation (IEC), under long-term Gas Sale and Purchase Agreements (Mari-B GSPAs). Due to end-of-field life declines in production from these fields, we will not be able to meet all contractual delivery commitments under the Mari-B GSPAs with reserves from these fields.In January 2012, we issued force majeure notices to certain customers. The Mari-B GSPAs have customary liability cap language that limits our financial exposure in the event we cannot fully deliver the contract quantities. Our liability is reflected as a reduction in sales price for periods in which we are delivering partial contract quantities, or as a direct payment to the customer in the event that no production is available for delivery (subject to force majeure considerations). To date, these adjustments have totaled approximately $13 million, net. These sales price adjustments did not have a material impact on our earnings or cash flows. As of December 31, 2012, a total of 218 Bcf, gross, (102 Bcf, net) remained to be delivered under the Mari-B GSPAs. In the fourth quarter of 2012, we and our Mari-B partners signed an agreement with IEC. The terms of the agreement provide for delivery of up to 100,000 MMBtu/d, gross, (47,000 MMBtu/d, net) of natural gas under the first IEC sales contract, once the Tamar field begins flowing, until the total contract quantity is fulfilled and, at the same time, termination of the second IEC sales contract. We have executed similar agreements with most of the other Mari-B gas purchasers. At December 31, 2012, our remaining Mari-B, Noa, and Pinnacles proved developed reserves totaled approximately 17 Bcf, net, and will be used to satisfy our share of the Mari-B GSPAs on a pro-rata basis until the Tamar field begins producing. We expect that approximately 30 Bcf, net, of our Tamar proved reserves will be used to satisfy our share of contract quantities that remain to be delivered under the Mari-B GSPAs, as impacted by the recent agreements, when the fields cease producing. The majority of the quantities remaining under the Mari-B GSPAs are expected to be delivered over a three year period with one minor commitment extending over a 10-year period. Tamar GSPAs As of December 31, 2012, we and our Tamar partners have entered into Gas Sale and Purchase Agreements (Tamar GSPAs) with the IEC and numerous other Israeli purchasers, including independent power producers, cogeneration 27Table of Contents facilities and industrial companies, for the sale of natural gas from the Tamar field. The Israeli government has approved the Tamar GSPAs.The Tamar GSPAs include the following:•sale of approximately 2.7 Tcf (approximately 1.0 Tcf net to us) of natural gas to IEC over an approximate 15-year period. IEC has the option to increase this amount to 3.5 Tcf (approximately 1.3 net to us), under certain conditions;•sale of approximately 2.5 Tcf (approximately 0.9 Tcf net to us) of natural gas to additional customers. Most contracts provide for the sale of natural gas over a 15 to 17 year period. Some of the contracts provide for increase or reduction in total quantities and some are interruptible during certain contract periods; and•sales prices based on an initial base price subject to price indexation over the life of the contract and with a floor. The IEC contract also provides for price reopeners in the eighth and eleventh years with limits on the increase/decrease from the contractual price.Under the Tamar GSPAs, we and our partners have a financial exposure in the event we cannot fully deliver the contract quantities. This exposure is capped by contract and will be reflected as a reduction in sales price for periods in which we are delivering partial contract quantities, or as a direct payment to the customer under certain circumstances and with a cap (subject to force majeure considerations). We believe that any such sales price adjustments or direct payments would not have a material impact on our earnings or cash flows. At December 31, 2012, we have recorded 2.2 Tcf, net, of PUD reserves for the Tamar field. We expect to begin reclassifying these PUD reserves to proved developed at first production, currently expected in second quarter 2013. See International - Eastern Mediterranean (Israel and Cyprus) - Tamar Natural Gas Project.Significant Purchaser Glencore Energy was the largest single non-affiliated purchaser of 2012 production and purchased our share of crude oil and condensate production from the Alba and Aseng fields in Equatorial Guinea. Sales to Glencore Energy accounted for 31% of 2012 total oil, gas and NGL sales, or 39% of 2012 crude oil sales. Shell Trading (US) Company and Shell International Trading and Shipping Limited (collectively, Shell) purchased crude oil and condensate domestically from the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and the Wattenberg area and internationally from the North Sea. Sales to Shell accounted for 14% of 2012 total oil, gas and NGL sales, or 17% of crude oil sales. No other single non-affiliated purchaser accounted for 10% or more of crude oil and natural gas sales in 2012. We believe that the loss of any one purchaser would not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations since there are numerous potential purchasers of our production. Hedging Activities Commodity prices were volatile in 2012 and prices for crude oil and natural gas are affected by a variety of factors beyond our control. We have used derivative instruments, and expect to do so in the future, in order to reduce the impact of commodity price uncertainty and increase cash flow predictability relating to the marketing of our crude oil and natural gas. As a result of hedging, near-term cash flow volatility is reduced, which allows us to plan our financial commitments and support our capital investment programs. Our practice is to hedge up to 50% of our forecasted domestic natural gas production and up to 50% of our total forecasted domestic and international crude oil production, for the current year plus two additional calendar years. We strive to maintain strong governance of our hedging program, including oversight by our Board of Directors. For additional information, see Item 1A. Risk Factors – Commodity and interest rate hedging transactions may limit our potential gains and We are exposed to counterparty credit risk as a result of our receivables, hedging transactions, and cash investments, Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 10. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. Regulations Government Regulation Exploration for, and production and marketing of, crude oil and natural gas are extensively regulated at the federal, state, and local levels in the US, and internationally. Crude oil and natural gas development and production activities are subject to various laws and regulations (and orders of regulatory bodies pursuant thereto) governing a wide variety of matters, including, among others, allowable rates of production, transportation, prevention of waste and pollution, and protection of the environment. Laws affecting the crude oil and natural gas industry are under constant review for amendment or expansion and frequently increase the regulatory requirements on oil and gas companies. Our ability to economically produce and sell crude oil and natural gas is affected by a number of legal and regulatory factors, including federal, state and local laws and regulations in the US and laws and regulations of foreign nations. Many of these governmental bodies have issued rules and regulations that require extensive efforts to ensure compliance and incremental cost to comply, and that carry substantial penalties for failure to comply. These laws, regulations and orders may restrict the rate of crude oil and natural gas production below the rate that would otherwise exist in the absence of such laws, regulations and orders. The regulatory requirements on the crude oil and natural gas industry often result in incremental costs of doing business 28Table of Contents and consequently affect our profitability. See Item 1A. Risk Factors – We are subject to increasing governmental regulations and environmental requirements that may cause us to incur substantial incremental costs. Internationally, our operations are subject to legal and regulatory oversight by energy-related ministries or other agencies of our host countries, each having certain relevant energy or hydrocarbons laws. Examples include: •the Ministry of Mines, Industry and Energy which, under such laws as the hydrocarbons law enacted in 2006 by the government of Equatorial Guinea, regulates our exploration, development and production activities offshore Equatorial Guinea;•the Ministry of Energy and Water Resources which regulates both our exploration and development activities offshore Israel and the Israeli electricity market into which we sell our natural gas production;•the Israeli Antitrust Commission which reviews Israel's domestic natural gas sales and ownership in offshore blocks and leases; •the Ministry of Commerce, Industry, and Tourism which regulates our exploration and development activities offshore Cyprus;•the Department of Energy and Climate Change which regulates our exploration and development activities in the UK sector of the North Sea;•various agencies in China which, under such laws as the Provisional Regulations on Administration and Management of the Abandonment of Offshore Oil and Gas Producing Facilities enacted in 2010, regulate our development and production activities offshore China;•the Petroleum Directorate which regulates our exploration activities offshore Sierra Leone; and•the Department of Mineral Resources which regulates our exploration activities offshore the Falkland Islands.Examples of other laws affecting our international operations are the Israeli Petroleum Profits Taxation Law, 2011, which imposes additional income tax on oil and gas production, and the UK Finance Bill 2011, which increased the rate of the Supplementary Charge levied on oil and gas income. Under the Israeli Petroleum Profits Taxation Law, 2011, the depletion allowance was abolished, and a levy at an initial rate of 20% was imposed on profits from oil and gas. The levy gradually rises to 50%, depending on the levy coefficient (the R-Factor). The R-Factor refers to the percentage of the amount invested in the exploration, development and establishment of the project, so that the 20% rate is imposed only after a recovery of 150% of the amount invested (R-Factor of 1.5) and scales linearly up to a maximum of 50% after a recovery of 230% of the amount invested (R-Factor of 2.3). The rate of royalties paid to the State of Israel remained unchanged. Also affecting our operations in Israel is the Law for Change in the Tax Burden (Amendments to Legislation), 2011 (the 2011 Tax Act). As from 2012, the 2011 Tax Act eliminates, inter alia, a previously enacted progressive reduction in the rate of corporate tax rate, and increases the corporate tax rate to 25%.Examples of US federal agencies with regulatory authority over our exploration for, and production and sale of, crude oil and natural gas include: •the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) and the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE), which under laws such as the Federal Land Policy and Management Act, Endangered Species Act, National Environmental Policy Act and Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, have certain authority over our operations on federal lands, particularly in the Rocky Mountains and deepwater Gulf of Mexico;•the Office of Natural Resources Revenue, which under the Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Management Act of 1982 has certain authority over our payment of royalties, rentals, bonuses, fines, penalties, assessments, and other revenue;•the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), which under laws such as the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, as amended, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended, the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, and the Occupational Safety and Health Act have certain authority over environmental, health and safety matters affecting our operations;•the US Fish and Wildlife Service, which under the Endangered Species Act has authority over activities that may result in the take of an endangered species or its habitat;•the US Army Corps of Engineers, which under the Clean Water Act has authority to regulate the construction of structures involving the fill of certain waters and wetlands subject to federal jurisdiction, including well pads, pipelines, and roads;•the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), which under laws such as the Energy Policy Act of 2005 has certain authority over the marketing and transportation of crude oil and natural gas we produce onshore and from the deepwater Gulf of Mexico; and•the Department of Transportation (DOT), which has certain authority over the transportation of products, equipment and personnel necessary to our onshore US and deepwater Gulf of Mexico operations.Other US federal agencies with certain authority over our business include the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the SEC. In addition, we are governed by the rules and regulations of the NYSE, upon which shares of our common stock are traded.29Table of Contents Various state and federal statutes prohibit certain actions that adversely affect endangered or threatened species and their habitat, wetlands, migratory birds, and natural resources. Where the taking or harm of such species occurs or may occur, or where damages to wetlands or natural resources may occur, the government or private parties may act to prevent oil and natural gas exploration activities. A federal or state agency could order a complete halt to drilling activities in certain locations or during certain seasons when such activities could result in a serious adverse effect upon a protected species. The presence of a protected species in areas where we operate could adversely affect future production from those areas.On May 17, 2010, the BLM issued a revised oil and gas leasing policy that requires, among other things, a more detailed environmental review prior to leasing oil and natural gas rights, increased public engagement in the development of master leasing and development plans prior to leasing areas where intensive new oil and gas development is anticipated, and a comprehensive parcel review process. The EPA has issued the Final Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases Rule, which requires many suppliers of fossil fuels or industrial chemicals, manufacturers of vehicles and engines, and other facilities that emit 25,000 metric tons or more of carbon dioxide equivalent per year to begin collecting greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions data, beginning in 2012 for 2011 emissions, under a new reporting system that went into effect on January 1, 2010. The first annual report was due September 30, 2011. In November 2010, the EPA issued final regulations requiring the annual reporting of GHG emissions from qualifying facilities in the upstream oil and natural gas sector, including onshore production (Subpart W). Substantially all of our onshore US properties are subject to the Subpart W reporting requirements.On April 18, 2012, the EPA issued regulations under the New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) and National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants. The new rules are related to emissions associated with crude oil and natural gas production, including natural gas wells that are hydraulically fractured. The required technologies and processes, while reducing emissions, will also enable companies to collect additional natural gas that can be sold. The EPA's final standards also address emissions from storage tanks and other equipment. The final rules establish a phase-in period that will ensure that manufacturers have time to make and broadly distribute the required emissions reduction technology. During the first phase, until January 2015, owners and operators must either flare their emissions or use emissions reduction technology called “green completions,” technologies that are already widely deployed at wells. In 2015, all newly fractured wells will be required to use green completions. The EPA's final rules have minimal impact on our business. The reduction of greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) is already one of our priorities and we have been working to improve our methods to reduce GHGs through operational and business practices. We use green completions or flaring on a number of our wells to comply with Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission (COGCC) rules. Additionally we've undertaken emission reduction projects such as our US Vapor Recovery Unit (VRU) program, where we have installed VRUs to capture gas that would otherwise be flared on a substantial number of our tank batteries.Most of the states within which we operate have separate agencies with authority to regulate related operational and environmental matters. Colorado Examples of such regulation on the operational side include the Greater Wattenberg Area Special Well Location Rule 318A (Rule 318A), which was adopted by the COGCC to address oil and gas well drilling, production, commingling and spacing in Wattenberg. On August 9, 2011, the COGCC approved amendments to Rule 318A. The amendments, which became effective on October 1, 2011, remove the limit on the number of wells which can produce from a particular formation, allowing wellbore spacing units and permitting wells to cross section lines. The amendments also address areas such as infill drilling, water sampling and waste management plans. In February 2013, the COGCC is expected to approve and implement new setback rules for oil and gas wells and production facilities located in close proximity to occupied buildings. If the new setback rules are approved, the current COGCC setback distances of 150 feet in rural areas and 350 feet in high density urban areas will be increased to a uniform 500 feet statewide setback from occupied buildings and a uniform 1,000 feet statewide setback from high occupancy building units. The new setback rules would also require operators to utilize increased mitigation measures to limit potential drilling impacts to surface owners and the owners of occupied building units. The new rules would also require advance notice to surface owners, the owners of occupied buildings and local governments prior to the filing of an Application for Permit to Drill or Oil and Gas Location Assessment as well as expanded outreach and communication efforts by an operator. The COGCC also approved two new rules making Colorado the first state to require sampling of groundwater for hydrocarbons and other indicator compounds both before and after drilling. The new statewide rule requires sampling of up to four water wells within a half mile radius of a new oil and gas well before drilling, between six and 12 months after completion, and between five and six years after completion. The revised rule for the GWA requires operators to sample only one water well per quarter governmental section before drilling and between six to 12 months after completion.30Table of Contents On the environmental side, Colorado Regulation Seven and requirements for storm water management plans were adopted by the Colorado Department of Environmental Quality, under delegation from the EPA, to regulate air emissions, water protection and waste handling and disposal relating to our oil and gas exploration and production.Pennsylvania On February 14, 2012, Governor Tom Corbett of Pennsylvania signed into law what is known as Act 13 of 2012 (Act 13). Act 13 represents the first comprehensive legislation regarding the development of the Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania. Act 13, among other things, enacted stronger environmental standards and established impact fees, which in 2012 equaled $50,000 for each horizontal Marcellus Shale well. Act 13 also increased the notice distance of unconventional well permit applications from 1,000 feet to 3,000 feet, and extended the setback distance for unconventional wells from 200 feet to 500 feet. The statute also increased the distance and duration of presumed liability for water pollution to 2,500 feet from a well site and twelve months after well completion, drilling, stimulation, or alteration. In addition, Act 13 imposed spill prevention requirements applicable to well site construction, wastewater transportation, and gathering lines. These requirements may result in increased costs and lower rates of return for our Marcellus Shale development project.In March 2012, seven municipalities filed suit against Act 13's statewide zoning provisions, claiming that Act 13 violated the state constitution. On July 26, 2012, the Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court declared the statewide zoning provisions in Act 13 unconstitutional, null, void and unenforceable. The Court also struck down the provision of the law that required the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection to grant waivers to the setback requirements in Pennsylvania's Oil and Gas Act. This decision was appealed to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court and arguments were presented on October 18, 2012. The decision from the Supreme Court is still pending, but a ruling upholding the lower court's decision could make it more difficult to develop our Marcellus acreage in some municipalities within Pennsylvania. NETL Study The US Department of Energy's National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) is conducting a comprehensive assessment of the environmental effects of shale gas production at two industry-provided Marcellus Shale test sites in southwestern Pennsylvania. Goals include: •documentation of environmental changes that are coincident with shale gas production; •development of technology or management practices that mitigate undesigned environmental changes; and•development of monitoring technologies to (1) assess the impact of shale gas production on air quality and (2)determine if zonal isolation between producing formations and drinking water aquifers is maintained after hydraulic fracturing.We will monitor the results of the NETL study in order to assess any potential impact on our onshore US development programs.In December 2011, the West Virginia legislature passed, and the governor signed, the Natural Gas Horizontal Wells Control Act, which, among other things, provides for increased well permit fees, well location restrictions, well site safety, public notice requirements for municipalities, and regulations regarding water use and wastewater handling.Some of the counties and municipalities within which we operate have adopted regulations or ordinances that impose additional restrictions on our oil and gas exploration and production. An example is Garfield County, Colorado, which provides local land and road use restrictions affecting our Piceance Basin operations and requires us to post bonds to secure any restoration obligations.Israeli Interministerial Committee In 2011, the Interministerial Committee to Examine Government Policy Regarding the Natural Gas Industry in Israel (the Committee) was charged with the task of proposing a government policy for developing the natural gas economy. Objectives include the following:•ensuring energy security in the economy;•providing a framework for substantial resource exports;•designating a certain percentage of production from each field for domestic natural gas demand;•maintaining competition in the different sectors of the local economy;•maximizing economic and political benefits; and•leveraging environmental advantages with respect to the use of natural gas.The Committee was also asked to examine, among other items, the desired policy to maintain reserves to supply local demand and export of natural gas. In September 2012, the Committee issued its final recommendations. In its report, the Committee stated that permitting export of natural gas does not prevent, but rather promotes the ensuring of the needs of domestic users and works to encourage development of natural gas-based domestic industry. The recommendations included, among others, the following points:•as a rule, all reservoirs should be charged with supplying a certain percentage of natural gas to the local economy, with minimum requirements based on reservoir size (minimum of 25%-50%). The minimum supply obligations will not apply for reservoirs under a certain size (25 BCM) but the reservoirs will be required to be connected to the domestic 31Table of Contents market. The recommendations allow for a lease in a developed reservoir to exchange its export quota against an "obligation to supply to the domestic market" which applies to any other leaseholder which submitted a development plan so long as approval therefor is given by the Petroleum Commissioner in the Ministry of Energy and Water Resources and by the Antitrust Authority;•a determination that the quantity of natural gas that should be guaranteed in favor of the local economy should be 450 BCM and that the quantity should be updated in five years;•the export of natural gas should be permitted as long as the quantity from all reservoirs does not exceed 500 BCM, which amount may be reassessed;•regulatory approval required for export, with export licenses eligible for periods up to 25 years;•there should be an absolute preference for the export of natural gas from a facility in an area under Israeli control, including Israel's exclusive economic zone, although further study of various export means (such as export from a foreign area governed by bilateral agreement) and statutory feasibility is necessary; and•steps should be taken to increase competition in the natural gas market. We are participating in the process and monitoring the impact of the Committee's recommendations. However, at this time, we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of the Committee's recommendations or the possible impact any resulting laws or regulations could have on our business. Certain changes in Israel's market, fiscal, and/or regulatory regimes occurring as a result of the Committee's recommendations could delay or reduce the profitability of our Tamar and/or Leviathan development projects and render future exploration and/or development projects uneconomic.Impact of Dodd-Frank Act Derivatives Regulation  The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act), which was passed by Congress and signed into law in July 2010, contains significant derivatives regulation, including requirements that certain transactions be cleared on exchanges and that collateral (commonly referred to as “margin”) be posted for such transactions. The Dodd-Frank Act provides for a potential exception from these clearing and collateral requirements for commercial end-users, such as us, and it includes a number of defined terms used in determining how this exception applies to particular derivative transactions and the parties to those transactions. As required by the Dodd-Frank Act, the Commodities Futures and Trading Commission (CFTC) has promulgated numerous rules to define these terms. We have been evaluating the provisions of the CFTC's final rules and assessing their impact on our commodity hedging program. At this time, we believe that we will be able to satisfy the requirements for the commercial end-user clearing exception and continue to engage in transactions which hedge commercial risk and are free of mandated clearing requirements. It is possible that the CFTC, in conjunction with prudential regulators, may mandate that financial counterparties entering into swap transactions with end-users must do so with credit support agreements in place, which could result in negotiated credit thresholds above which an end-user must post collateral. If this should occur, we intend to manage our credit relationships to minimize collateral requirements. The CFTC's final rules will also have an impact on our hedging counterparties. For example, our bank counterparties will be required to post collateral and assume compliance burdens resulting in additional costs. We expect that much of the increased costs will be passed on to us, thereby decreasing the relative effectiveness of our hedges and our profitability. To the extent we incur increased costs or are required to post collateral in periods of rising commodity prices, there could be a corresponding decrease in amounts available for our capital investment program. See Item 1A. Risk Factors - Derivatives regulation included in current or proposed financial legislation and rulemaking could impede our ability to manage business and financial risks by restricting our use of derivative instruments as hedges against fluctuating commodity prices and interest rates.Impact of Dodd-Frank Act Section 1504 Section 1504 of the Dodd-Frank Act required the SEC to issue rules requiring resource extraction issuers to include in an annual report information relating to any payment made by the issuer, a subsidiary of the issuer, or an entity under the control of the issuer, to a foreign government or the federal government for the purpose of the commercial development of oil, natural gas, or minerals. On August 22, 2012, the SEC issued a final rule, Disclosure of Payments by Resource Extraction Issuers (Rule). The Rule requires resource extraction issuers, such as us, to provide information about the type and total amount of payments made for each project related to the commercial development of oil, natural gas, or minerals, and the type and total amount of payments made to each government. The first report is due May 30, 2014.In October 2012, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, American Petroleum Institute, Independent Petroleum Association of America, and National Foreign Trade Council filed a lawsuit against the SEC in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The petitioners argued that the Rule is “arbitrary and capricious” within the meaning of the Administrative Procedure Act and that the Rule and statute violate the First Amendment. Briefs have been submitted. Oral arguments are not yet scheduled.See Item 1A. Risk Factors - Disclosure of certain operating information as required by Section 1504 of the Dodd-Frank Act could have a negative impact on our operations.32Table of Contents See also Item 1A. Risk Factors - Our operations may be adversely affected by changes in the fiscal regimes and government policies and regulation of oil and gas development in the countries in which we operate for a discussion of the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012.Environmental Matters As a developer, owner and operator of crude oil and natural gas properties, we are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign country laws and regulations relating to the discharge of materials into, and the protection of, the environment. We must take into account the cost of complying with environmental regulations in planning, designing, drilling, operating and abandoning wells. In most instances, the regulatory requirements relate to the handling and disposal of drilling and production waste products, water and air pollution control procedures, facility siting and construction, and the remediation of petroleum-product contamination. Under state and federal laws, we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes, including wastes disposed of or released by us or prior owners or operators in accordance with current laws or otherwise, to suspend or cease operations in contaminated areas, or to perform remedial well plugging operations or cleanups to prevent future contamination. The EPA and various state agencies have limited the disposal options for hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. The owner and operator of a site, and persons that treated, disposed of or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances found at a site, may be liable, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. The EPA, state environmental agencies and, in some cases, third parties are authorized to take actions in response to threats to human health or the environment and to seek to recover from responsible classes of persons the costs of such action. Furthermore, certain wastes generated by our crude oil and natural gas operations that are currently exempt from treatment as hazardous wastes may in the future be designated as hazardous wastes and, therefore, be subject to considerably more rigorous and costly operating and disposal requirements. See Item 1A. Risk Factors – We are subject to increasing governmental regulations and environmental requirements that may cause us to incur substantial incremental costs. Federal and state occupational safety and health laws require us to organize information about hazardous materials used, released or produced in our operations. Certain portions of this information must be provided to employees, state and local governmental authorities and local citizens. We are also subject to the requirements and reporting set forth in federal workplace standards. Certain state or local laws or regulations and common law may impose liabilities in addition to, or restrictions more stringent than, those described herein.We have made and will continue to make expenditures necessary to comply with environmental requirements. We do not believe that we have, to date, expended material amounts in connection with such activities or that compliance with such requirements will have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. Although such requirements do have a substantial impact on the crude oil and natural gas industry, they do not appear to affect us to any greater or lesser extent than other companies in the industry. Hydraulic Fracturing Concerns The practice of hydraulic fracturing, especially the hydraulic fracturing processes associated with drilling in shale formations, is the subject of significant focus among some environmentalists, regulators and the general public. Concerns over potential hazards associated with the use of hydraulic fracturing and its impact on the environment have been raised at all levels, including federal, state and local, as well as internationally. There have been claims that hydraulic fracturing may contaminate groundwater, reduce air quality or cause earthquakes. Hydraulic fracturing requires the use and disposal of water, and public concern has been growing over its possible effects on drinking water supplies, as well as the adequacy of supply. Our Operations Hydraulic fracturing techniques have been used by the industry for many years, and, currently, more than 90% of all oil and natural gas wells drilled in the US employ hydraulic fracturing. We strive to adopt best practices and industry standards and comply with all regulatory requirements regarding well construction and operation. For example, the qualified service companies we use to perform hydraulic fracturing, as well as our personnel, monitor rate and pressure to assure that the services are performed as planned. Our well construction practices include installation of multiple layers of protective steel casing surrounded by cement that are specifically designed and installed to protect freshwater aquifers by preventing the migration of fracturing fluids into aquifers. We strive to procure non-hydrologic water (water that is not connected to a natural surface stream); approximately 80% of our water is from non-tributary sources, such as deep ground water. In the DJ Basin, we are in the process of securing additional water rights in support of our drilling program and implementing a pilot water recycling program. In the Marcellus Shale, our joint development agreement with CONSOL provides us with access to water resources which we believe will be adequate to execute our development program, and we engage in recycling efforts. We believe that these processes help ensure that hydraulic fracturing does not pose a meaningful risk to water supplies. Potential Rulemaking Although hydraulic fracturing is regulated primarily at the state level, governments and agencies at all levels from federal to municipal are conducting studies and considering regulations. For example, in 2011, the US Secretary of 33Table of Contents Energy formed the Shale Gas Production Subcommittee (Subcommittee), a subcommittee of the Secretary of Energy Advisory Board. The Subcommittee was charged with making recommendations to improve the safety and environmental performance of hydraulic fracturing. On August 18, 2011, the Subcommittee issued its Ninety Day Report (Report), which focused exclusively on the production of natural gas (and some liquid hydrocarbons) from shale formations with hydraulic fracturing stimulation in either vertical or horizontal wells. The Subcommittee identified four primary areas of concern including possible water pollution, air pollution, disruption of the community during production, and potential for adverse impact on communities and ecosystems. The Subcommittee also set forth a list of recommendations addressing, among other areas, communications, air quality, protection of water supply and quality, disclosure of fracturing fluid composition, reduction of diesel fuel use, continuous development of best practices, and federal sponsorship of research and development with respect to unconventional gas. The Subcommittee issued its Final Report in November 2011 which recommends implementation of the Subcommittee’s recommendations by federal and state agencies. We continue to monitor the impact the Subcommittee’s recommendations, and any resulting rule-making activities evolving at federal and state levels, could have on our exploration and development activities in shale formations.During 2012, the BLM proposed regulations governing hydraulic fracturing on federal lands. The regulations would require: (1) public disclosure of chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing operations; (2) assurances on well-bore integrity to verify that fluids used in wells during fracturing operations are not escaping; and (3) confirmation of a water management plan in place for handling fracturing fluids that flow back to the surface. On January 21, 2013, the BLM announced that it was withdrawing its proposed regulations and would reissue a new set of proposed regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing later in 2013.During 2012, the EPA proposed new guidelines under the Safe Drinking Water Act regarding the issuance of permits for the use of diesel fuel as a component in hydraulic fracturing activities. The draft guidance outlines for EPA permit writers, where EPA is the permitting authority, requirements for diesel fuels used for hydraulic fracturing wells, technical recommendations for permitting those wells, and a description of diesel fuels for EPA underground injection control permitting.The EPA is currently studying the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources. Results are expected to be released in a draft for public and peer review in 2014. In addition, the EPA’s recently-issued proposed rules subjecting oil and gas operations to regulation under the New Source Performance Standards will be applicable to newly drilled and fractured wells as well as existing wells that are refractured. In June 2012, OSHA and the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) issued a joint hazard alert for workers who use silica (sand) in hydraulic fracturing activities. OSHA is working with industry and other government agencies to review existing regulations for applicability to hydraulic fracturing. In 2012, the City of Longmont, Colorado voted to ban hydraulic fracturing activities within city limits. Subsequently, the State of Colorado, through the COGCC, sued the City of Longmont in Boulder County District Court to set aside a city ordinance that promulgated stricter oil and gas rules than the COGCC Rules asserting that portions of these rules are preempted by State statutes and COGCC rules. The Colorado Oil and Gas Association (COGA) moved to intervene in this action and intervention was granted. COGA also separately sued the City of Longmont claiming that the resolution is a taking of the mineral property rights and an improper regulatory impairment of such rights, that it is effectively an illegal ban on drilling, and otherwise asserting that the ban must be set aside since it conflicts with Colorado state law allowing the practice.  We continue to monitor new and proposed legislation and regulations to assess the potential impact on our operations. We are currently evaluating the possible impact any proposed rules, such as those described above, could have on our business. Any additional federal, state or local restrictions on hydraulic fracturing that may be imposed in areas in which we conduct business could result in substantial incremental operating, capital and compliance costs as well as delay our ability to develop oil and gas reserves.Public Disclosure Several states have issued regulations requiring disclosure of certain information regarding the components used in the hydraulic-fracturing process. In 2011, the Texas Railroad Commission (RRC) adopted the Hydraulic Fracturing Chemical Disclosure rule, under which companies are required to provide a listing of chemical ingredients used to hydraulically fracture wells that are permitted by the RRC on or after February 1, 2012 on a public national chemical disclosure registry, FracFocus.org, operated jointly by the Interstate Oil & Gas Compact Commission and the Ground Water Protection Council. In December 2011, the COGCC adopted hydraulic fracturing fluid ingredient regulations requiring disclosure of all chemicals and establishing ways to protect proprietary information. The regulations allow disclosure through the FracFocus web site. The State of Wyoming also requires disclosure of the types and amounts of chemicals. In 2012, through legislation known as Act 13, Pennsylvania established a requirement that operators submit information regarding hydraulic fracturing chemicals to FracFocus.org. Other states have proposed, or are considering, similar regulations which require specific disclosures by operators and/or outline requirements for construction and operation of wells and monitoring of well activity. We are currently providing disclosure information on FracFocus.org for all onshore US areas in which we operate. 34Table of Contents Additional Information See: •Items 1. and 2.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources – Risk and Insurance Program.Undeveloped Oil and Gas Leases   Oil and gas exploration is a lengthy process of obtaining data, evaluating, and de-risking prospects, and it takes time to develop resources in a responsible manner. The period of time from lease acquisition to discovery can take many years of continuous effort. We begin by leasing acreage (or deepwater lease blocks) from individuals, other operators or the federal government. It may take years for us to assemble enough acreage to cover the areal extent of a prospect that we wish to explore. Once the acreage position is assembled, we obtain seismic data either through purchase of available data or by contracting for seismic services. Our exploration staff then begin a lengthy process of analyzing the seismic and other data in order to identify a potential optimal location for drilling an initial exploratory well. Once we decide to drill an exploratory well, we must obtain permits and locate a drilling rig with the specifications for the depth and pressure situation in which we will drill. For example, several years ago, we wanted to leverage our expertise in the Wattenberg area to open a new opportunity in Northern Colorado. We began acquiring acreage spanning an area from the edge of the GWA to the Wyoming border. It took over two years to assemble enough acreage through acquisition and leasing to have a significant enough acreage position to warrant data collection. Once the acreage position had been established, we conducted an extensive 3D seismic program and obtained other data as well, which our exploration staff analyzed and used to plan an initial drilling program. After drilling an exploratory well, we must integrate data, such as core samples and well logs, obtained from the drilling process with our seismic and other data to determine if we have discovered hydrocarbons.If there is a discovery, we may need to obtain additional data and/or drill appraisal wells in order to estimate the extent of the reservoir and the volume of resources that could potentially be recovered, and make an investment decision. Appraisal or development drilling requires additional time to contract for an appropriate drilling rig, and obtain pipe, other equipment, and supplies. Due to the current high level of drilling activity, drilling rigs and hydraulic fracturing crews are in high demand, and there could be substantial delays as we wait for rigs or crews to become available.In Northern Colorado, our data collection efforts resulted in a successful initial drilling program. Due to the success of our first wells, we have continued the Northern Colorado drilling program and, in 2012, we drilled 25 development wells.We strive to maintain an appropriate inventory of onshore and offshore exploration prospects suitable to our experience as an operator, financial resources, and current development timeline. Competition The crude oil and natural gas industry is highly competitive. We encounter competition from other crude oil and natural gas companies in all areas of operations, including the acquisition of seismic and lease rights on crude oil and natural gas properties and for the labor and equipment required for exploration and development of those properties. Our competitors include major integrated crude oil and natural gas companies, state-controlled national oil companies, independent crude oil and natural gas companies, service companies engaging in exploration and production activities, drilling partnership programs, private equity, and individuals. Many of our competitors are large, well-established companies. Such companies may be able to pay more for seismic and lease rights on crude oil and natural gas properties and exploratory prospects and to define, evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit. Our ability to acquire additional properties and to discover reserves in the future will be dependent upon our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment. See Item 1A. Risk Factors – We face significant competition and many of our competitors have resources in excess of our available resources. Geographical Data We have operations throughout the world and manage our operations by country. Information is grouped into four components that are all primarily in the business of crude oil, natural gas and NGL exploration, development and production: United States, 35Table of Contents West Africa, Eastern Mediterranean, and Other International and Corporate. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 17. Segment Information. Employees Our total number of employees increased 17%, from 1,876 at December 31, 2011 to 2,190 at December 31, 2012, in support of our major development and exploration projects. The 2012 year-end employee count includes 203 foreign nationals working as employees in Israel, the UK, Equatorial Guinea, Cyprus, and Cameroon. We regularly use independent contractors and consultants to perform various field and other services. Offices Our principal corporate office is located at 100 Glenborough Drive, Suite 100, Houston, Texas 77067-3610. We maintain additional offices in Ardmore, Oklahoma; Denver, Colorado; Greeley, Colorado; and Canonsburg, Pennsylvania; and in China, Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea, Israel, Cyprus, Nicaragua, and the UK. Title to Properties We believe that our title to the various interests set forth above is satisfactory and consistent with generally accepted industry standards, subject to exceptions that would not materially detract from the value of the interests or materially interfere with their use in our operations. Individual properties may be subject to burdens such as royalty, overriding royalty and other outstanding interests customary in the industry. In addition, interests may be subject to obligations or duties under applicable laws or burdens such as production payments, net profits interest, liens incident to operating agreements and for current taxes, development obligations under crude oil and natural gas leases or capital commitments under PSCs or exploration licenses.Butler vs. Powers On September 7, 2011, an intermediate appellate court (Superior Court) in Pennsylvania issued an opinion in Butler v. Powers regarding the interpretation of a deed. As a result, traditional views of how ownership of shale gas is determined in that state have been called into question. The issue raised by the case is whether shale gas is different from other natural gas and should be considered part of mineral rights, rather than oil and gas rights, because shale gas is contained inside unconventional shale rock. An appeal of the decision was subsequently filed with the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, which decided to hear the appeal. Written and oral arguments in the case have been presented and the parties are awaiting the decision of the Court. At this time, no case law or interpretation of existing law has changed, nor has there been an indication that either the Superior Court or the Pennsylvania Supreme Court will seek to change existing law. Based upon our initial review, we believe that any adverse decision in the pending case would have minimal adverse impact upon the assets acquired from CONSOL and our Marcellus Shale joint venture operations. Title Defects Subsequent to a lease or fee interest acquisition, such as our Marcellus Shale acquisition in 2011, the buyer usually has a period of time in which to examine the leases for title defects. Adjustments for title defects are generally made within the terms of the sales agreement, which may provide for arbitration between the buyer and seller. We continue to examine some of our Marcellus Shale leases and fee interests for potential title defects. Options to address uncured title defects include a reduction in the remaining amount of the CONSOL Carried Cost Obligation, an indemnity agreement, or the transfer of additional interests.Conflicts with Surface Rights Mineral rights are property rights that confer to the holder the right to use land surface that is reasonably necessary to access minerals beneath. Lawsuits regarding conflicts between surface rights and mineral rights are currently pending in several states. In several cases, owners of surface rights are suing to prevent companies from using their land surface to drill horizontal wells to explore for or produce natural gas from neighboring mineral tracts. If a plaintiff were to prevail in such a case, it could become more difficult and expensive for a company to place multi-acre well pads and/or limit the length of horizontal wells drilled from a pad.Risk ManagementThe oil and gas business is subject to many significant risks, including operational, strategic, financial and compliance/regulatory risks. We strive to maintain a proactive enterprise risk management (ERM) process to plan, organize, and control our activities in a manner which is intended to minimize the effects of risk on our capital, cash flows and earnings. ERM expands our process to include risks associated with accidental losses, as well as financial, strategic, operational, regulatory, political, and other risks.Our ERM process is designed to operate in an annual cycle, integrated with our long range plans, and supportive of our capital structure planning. Elements include, among others, a robust global compliance program, credit risk management, a commodity hedging program to reduce the impacts of commodity price volatility, an insurance program to protect against disruptions in our cash flows, and cash flow at risk (CFAR) analysis. We benchmark our program against our peers and other global organizations. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for a discussion of specific risks we face in our business.36Table of Contents Available InformationOur website address is www.nobleenergyinc.com.

Risk FactorsDescribed below are certain risks that we believe are applicable to our business and the oil and gas industry in which we operate. There may be additional risks that are not presently material or known. You should carefully consider each of the following risks and all other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If any of the events described below occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or access to the capital markets could be materially adversely affected. In addition, the current global economic and political environment intensifies many of these risks. Crude oil, natural gas, and NGL prices are volatile and a reduction in these prices could adversely affect our results of operations, our liquidity, and the price of our common stock.Our revenues, operating results and future rate of growth depend highly upon the prices we receive for our crude oil, natural gas, and NGL production. Historically, the markets for crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs have been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile in the future. For example, high and low daily average settlement prices for prompt month contracts for crude oil and natural gas during 2012 were as follows:   Daily Average Settlement Price for Prompt Month Contracts  High LowYear Ended December 31, 2012    NYMEX     Crude Oil - WTI (Per Bbl) $109.77 $77.69 Natural Gas - HH (Per MMBtu) 3.90 1.91Brent     Crude Oil (Per Bbl) 126.22 89.23Prices for our NGL production are determined at two primary market centers, Conway and Mt. Belvieu. For the year ended December 31, 2012, our consolidated net realized NGL prices were approximately 37% of consolidated net realized crude oil prices and tended to track the volatility of NYMEX WTI.The markets and prices for crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs depend on factors beyond our control, factors including, among others:• economic factors impacting global gross domestic product growth rates; • global demand for crude oil, natural gas and NGLs;• global factors impacting supply quantities of crude oil, natural gas and NGLs;• OPEC spare capacity relative to global crude oil supply;• further application of horizontal drilling techniques which could increase production and significantly impact both domestic and global supplies of crude oil and natural gas;•  ability to develop natural gas in shale or crude oil in tight formations relatively inexpensively which could increase the supply of natural gas or crude oil;• the potential expansion of the global LNG market, including potential exports from the US;• actions taken by foreign hydrocarbon-producing nations;• political conditions and events (including instability or armed conflict) in hydrocarbon-producing regions;37Table of Contents •the existence of government imposed price and or product subsidies;•the price and availability of alternative fuels, including coal, solar, wind, nuclear energy and biofuels;•the long-term impact on the crude oil market of the use of natural gas as an alternative fuel for road transportation;•the availability of pipeline capacity and infrastructure;•the availability of crude oil transportation and refining capacity;•weather conditions;•demand for electricity as well as natural gas used as fuel for electricity generation; •impact of conservation efforts on the ability to access government-owned and other lands for exploration and production activities; and•domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes.Declines in commodity prices or lack of natural gas storage may have the following effects on our business:•reduction of our revenues, operating income and cash flows;•curtailment or shut-in of our natural gas production due to lack of transportation or storage capacity;•reduction in the amount of crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs that we can produce economically;•cause certain properties in our portfolio to become economically unviable;•cause us to delay or postpone some of our capital projects, including our horizontal Niobrara and Marcellus Shale, deepwater Gulf of Mexico, or international development projects;•cause significant reductions in our capital investment programs, resulting in a reduced ability to develop our reserves;•limit our financial condition, liquidity, and/or ability to finance planned capital expenditures and operations; and•limit our access to sources of capital, such as equity and long-term debt.In addition, lower commodity prices, including declines in the forward commodity price curves, may result in the following:•asset impairment charges resulting from reductions in the carrying values of our oil and gas properties at the date of assessment, such as occurred in 2012, 2011, and 2010; •additional counterparty credit risk exposure on commodity hedges; or •a reduction in the carrying value of goodwill.Failure to effectively execute our major development projects could result in significant delays and/or cost over-runs, damage to our reputation, limitation of our growth and negative impact on our operating results, liquidity and financial position.We currently have an extensive inventory of major development projects in various stages of development. Gunflint, Big Bend, Leviathan, Cyprus, Carla and Diega are being appraised and, as such, not yet sanctioned, and it will take several years before first production is achieved. Some projects, such as crude oil and natural gas projects offshore West Africa and the Eastern Mediterranean, entail significant technical and other complexity, including extensive subsea tiebacks to an FPSO or production platform, pressure maintenance systems, gas re-injection systems, onshore receiving terminals, or other specialized infrastructure. Our Leviathan project also includes potential LNG infrastructure. In addition, we have expanded our horizontal drilling programs in the Niobrara formation and Marcellus Shale. This level of development activity requires significant effort from our management and technical personnel and places additional requirements on our financial resources and internal financial controls. In addition, we have increased dependency on third-party technology and service providers and other supply chain participants for these complex projects. We may not be able to fully execute these projects due to:•inability to attract and/or retain sufficient quantity of personnel with the skills required to bring these complex projects to production on schedule and on budget;•significant delays in delivery of essential items or performance of services, cost overruns, supplier insolvency, or other critical supply failure could adversely affect project development;•lack of government approval for projects;•civil disturbances, anti-development activities, legal challenges or other interruptions which could prevent access; and•drilling hazards or accidents or natural disasters. We may not be able to compensate for, or fully mitigate, these risks.Our international operations may be adversely affected by economic and political developments.We have significant international operations, with approximately 40% of our 2012 total consolidated sales volumes coming from international areas. This will be increasing as major development projects offshore West Africa and the Eastern Mediterranean begin producing in 2013. We are also conducting exploration activities in these and other international areas. Our operations may be adversely affected by political and economic developments, including the following:38Table of Contents •renegotiation, modification or nullification of existing contracts, such as may occur pursuant to future regulations enacted as a result of recommendations of Israel's Interministerial Committee to Examine Government Policy on Israel's Natural Gas Economy (Interministerial Committee), or the hydrocarbons law enacted in 2006 by the government of Equatorial Guinea, which can result in an increase in the amount of revenues that the host government receives from production (government take) or otherwise decrease project profitability;•loss of revenue, property and equipment as a result of actions taken by foreign hydrocarbon-producing nations, such as expropriation or nationalization of assets or termination of contracts, such as the termination of our Block 3 PSC by the Ecuadorian government in 2010 pursuant to changes in Ecuador's hydrocarbon law; •disruptions caused by territorial or boundary disputes in certain international regions, including the Eastern Mediterranean, where Lebanon has made claims related to our projects in Israeli waters and the Turkish government in Ankara objected to exploratory activities conducted offshore the Republic of Cyprus; •changes in drilling or safety regulations in other countries as a result of the Deepwater Horizon Incident or other incidents that have occurred, such as offshore Brazil and in China's Bohai Bay, which could increase costs and development cycle time;•laws and policies of the US and foreign jurisdictions affecting foreign investment, taxation, trade and business conduct;•foreign exchange restrictions;•international monetary fluctuations and changes in the relative value of the US dollar as compared with the currencies of other countries in which we conduct business, such as Israel; and•other hazards arising out of foreign governmental sovereignty over areas in which we conduct operations.Certain of these risks could be intensified by large crude oil or natural gas discoveries in areas where we are currently conducting exploration activities, such as in the Eastern Mediterranean, offshore Nicaragua, or the Falkland Islands. Large discoveries, such as ours in the Levant Basin, may have impacts on global natural gas supplies.Such political and economic developments as mentioned above could have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows and reduce the fair values of our properties, resulting in impairment charges. Our operations may be adversely affected by changes in the fiscal regimes and government policies and regulation of oil and gas development in the countries in which we operate.Fiscal regimes impact oil and gas companies through laws and regulations governing royalties, taxes, resource access, or level of government participation in oil and gas projects. We operate in the US and other countries whose fiscal regimes may change over time. Changes in fiscal regimes result in an increase or decrease in the amount of government take, and a corresponding decrease or increase in the revenues of an oil and gas company operating in that particular country. For example, the Petroleum Profits Taxation Law, 2011, imposed additional income tax on oil and gas production in Israel. A large portion of our production comes from Equatorial Guinea; therefore, changes in its fiscal regime could have a significant impact on our operations. In addition, we cannot predict how government agencies or courts will interpret existing tax laws and regulations or the effect such interpretations could have on our business.Many countries are currently experiencing fiscal problems and sustained structural government budget deficits and lower tax revenues triggered by the lingering effects of the global economic crisis of 2008, associated recession and current slower economic growth rates. Higher unemployment and slower growth rates, coupled with a reduced tax base, have resulted in reduced government revenues, while government expenditures continue to grow due to the costs of entitlements, subsidies and economic stimulus programs. Many countries have generated significant budget deficits and sovereign debt levels with some approaching insolvency. Demands on certain governments to undertake austerity measures in response to the European debt crisis have resulted in increased social unrest. In addition, certain non-governmental organizations are promoting "tax fairness", "fair share" payments, and income redistribution. Regulations enacted to achieve "tax fairness" or income redistribution could result in increased tax burdens on individuals or corporations.Due to pressures from financial markets or local constituents to address these negative fiscal situations and initiate deficit reduction measures, many governments are seeking additional revenue sources, including increases in government take from oil and gas projects. In the US, on January 2, 2013, the President signed into law The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (the Act). The Act extended through 2013 certain expired and expiring business tax provisions, including the research credit, bonus depreciation and others. However, the Act did not settle the debate on deficit reduction as the bill delayed mandatory across-the-board spending cuts known as sequestration, nor did it address increasing entitlement costs and fundamental tax reform. In recent years, certain measures have been proposed that would alter current tax expense on oil and gas companies through: the repeal of percentage depletion for oil and natural gas properties, the deferral of expensing intangible drilling and development costs (IDC), the inability to expense costs of certain domestic production activities, and a lengthening of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures. It is likely that some of these proposals to increase taxes on the oil and gas 39Table of Contents industry will continue to be reviewed by the US Congress in 2013 or future years. The enactment of some or all of these proposals would have a significant negative impact on our capital investment, production and growth. In particular, we estimate that the elimination of the current deductibility of IDC expenditures would impact our cash available for investment and could curtail our domestic capital spending program by 15 - 25%.In addition, although Congress recently passed, and the President signed into law, a bill that suspended the debt ceiling until May 19, 2013, the long-term debt ceiling and federal budget deficit issues must be resolved. Congress must pass new legislation and the President must sign it into law in order to avoid or mitigate these situations. At this time, substantial uncertainty exists as to whether or how these matters will be resolved. Certain measures, if enacted too suddenly, could reduce economic growth and increase the risk of a recession.Changes in fiscal regimes have long-term impacts on our business strategy, and uncertainty makes it more difficult to formulate capital investment programs. The implementation of new, or the modification of existing, laws or regulations impacting the amount of government take could disrupt our business plans and negatively impact our operations in the following ways, among others: •restrict resource access or lease holding;•reduce exploration activities, which could have a long-term negative impact on the quantities of proved reserves we record and inhibit future production growth; •have a negative impact on the ability of us and/or our partners to obtain project financing;•cause delay in or cancellation of development plans, which could also have a long-term negative impact on the quantities of proved reserves we record and inhibit future production growth;•reduce the profitability of our projects, resulting in decreases in net income and cash flows with the potential to make future investments uneconomical;•result in current projects becoming uneconomic, to the extent fiscal changes are retroactive, thereby reducing the amount of proved reserves we record and cash flows we receive, and possibly resulting in asset impairment charges;•require that valuation allowances be established against deferred tax assets, with offsetting increases in income tax expense, resulting in decreases in net income;•restrict our ability to compete with imported volumes of crude oil or natural gas; and/or•adversely affect the price of our common stock.Our operations may be adversely affected by violent acts such as from civil disturbances, terrorist acts, regime changes, cross-border violence, war, piracy, or other conflicts that may occur in regions that encompass our operations.Violent acts resulting in loss of life and destruction of property occur around the world. Many incidents are driven by civil, ethnic, religious or economic strife. In addition, the number of incidents attributed to various terrorist organizations has increased significantly. We operate in regions of the world that have experienced such incidents or are in close proximity to areas where violence has occurred including:US and Europe  Within the last decade, violent acts have occurred which specifically targeted citizens and property of the US and other Western nations including the September 11, 2001 World Trade Center attack, the 2004 Madrid train bombing, the 2005 attack on London's public transportation system, and the 2012 attacks on US embassies in Libya, Egypt and Yemen. Attacks on Western citizens and property occur not just on US and European soil, but worldwide. West Africa In the countries of West Africa there have been numerous acts of piracy, kidnapping, civil strife, regional conflict, cross-border violence, war, as well as violence associated with corruption, drug trafficking and regime changes. For example, in January 2013, numerous workers at a natural gas facility in Algeria were taken hostage and some were killed. In 2012, the government of Mali asked the United Nations to aid its defense against armed rebels. Also in 2012, militants in Nigeria continued their attacks on residents and property, and engaged in cross border attacks into Cameroon. In addition, deadly labor violence occurred in South Africa. Violence, loss of life and property damage associated with piracy in the Gulf of Guinea have impacted several countries of West Africa as well as the international community. Middle East Civil unrest, often accompanied by violence, has spread throughout the region. Protesters have demanded economic and political reforms, and to date, there have been several regime changes. Civil unrest could continue to spread throughout the region or grow in intensity, leading to regime changes resulting in governments that are hostile to the US, civil wars, or regional conflict. There have also been rising international tensions over Iran, which was censured by the United Nations over its nuclear development activities. Certain countries have implemented economic sanctions and/or considered pre-emptive strikes on suspected nuclear sites. Iranian officials have threatened retaliation by, among other actions, closing the Strait of Hormuz, through which a significant portion of the global crude oil supply is transported.40Table of Contents In November 2012, Israel and the Hamas militant group were engaged in air strikes and rocket attacks resulting in civilian deaths. Although a cease-fire is currently in effect, some level of conflict is likely to continue. In December 2012, the Turkish-Syrian border became militarized; US and Dutch NATO troops were deployed to defend against the perceived threat of a Syrian missile attack, possibly with chemical weapons.Central America There have been numerous acts of violence associated with drug trafficking and constant military and police operations targeting organized crime. The existence of autonomous regions in Nicaragua could increase instability or conflict with the central government.We monitor the economic and political environments of the countries in which we operate. However, we are unable to predict the occurrence of disturbances such as those noted above. In addition, we have limited ability to mitigate their impact. Civil disturbances, terrorist acts, regime changes, war, or conflicts, or the threats thereof, could have the following results, among others: •volatility in global crude oil prices which could negatively impact the global economy, resulting in slower economic growth rates, which could reduce demand for our products;•negative impact on the world crude oil supply if infrastructure or transportation are disrupted, leading to further commodity price volatility; •difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified personnel to work in areas with potential for conflict;•inability of our personnel or supplies to enter or exit the countries where we are conducting operations;•disruption of our operations due to evacuation of personnel;•inability to deliver our production due to disruption or closing of transportation routes;•reduced ability to export our production due to efforts of countries to conserve domestic resources;•damage to or destruction of our wells, production facilities, receiving terminals or other operating assets;•damage to or destruction of property belonging to our natural gas purchasers leading to interruption of gas deliveries, claims of force majeure, and/or termination of natural gas sales contracts, resulting in a reduction in our revenues;•inability of our service and equipment providers to deliver items necessary for us to conduct our operations resulting in a halt or delay in our planned exploration activities, delayed development of major projects, or shut-in of producing fields;•lack of availability of drilling rig, oilfield equipment or services if third party providers decide to exit the region;•shutdown of a financial system, communications network, or power grid causing a complete disruption of our business activities; and•capital market reassessment of risk and subsequent reallocation of capital to more stable areas making it more difficult for our partners to obtain financing for potential development projects.Loss of property and/or interruption of our business plans resulting from civil unrest could have a significant negative impact on our earnings and cash flow. In addition, we may not have enough insurance to cover any loss of property or other claims resulting from these risks. Concentration of our operations in a few core areas may increase our risk of production loss. Our operations are concentrated in five core areas: the DJ Basin, the Marcellus Shale, and the deepwater Gulf of Mexico in the US, offshore West Africa, and the Eastern Mediterranean. These core areas provide approximately 85% of our current production, each of our major development projects, and most of our exploration potential. During 2012, we initiated a non-core divestiture program to high-grade and focus our portfolio, and sold certain non-core onshore US and North Sea assets. As a result of these portfolio changes, our operations and production are concentrated in fewer areas, and more of our production is from fewer wells. For example, approximately 20% of our 2012 production came from four offshore developments. Although, individually, none of these core areas represent more than 33% of our 2012 total sales volumes, disruption of our business in one of these areas, such as from an accident, natural disaster, government intervention, or other event, would result in a greater impact on our production profile, cash flows and overall business plan than if we operated in a larger number of areas. We do not maintain business interruption (loss of production) insurance for all of our assets. Loss of production or limited access to reserves in one of our core operating areas could have a significant negative impact on our cash flows and profitability.Exploration, development and production risks and natural disasters could result in liability exposure or the loss of production and revenues.Our operations are subject to hazards and risks inherent in the drilling, production and transportation of crude oil and natural gas, including:•injuries and/or deaths of employees, supplier personnel, or other individuals;41Table of Contents •pipeline ruptures and spills;•fires, explosions, blowouts and well cratering;•equipment malfunctions and/or mechanical failure on high-volume, high-impact wells;•leaks or spills occurring during the transfer of hydrocarbons from an FPSO to an oil tanker;•loss of product occurring as a result of transfer to a rail car or train derailments;•formations with abnormal pressures and basin subsidence;•release of pollutants;•surface spillage of, or contamination of groundwater by, fluids used in hydraulic fracturing operations;•security breaches, cyber attacks, piracy, or terroristic acts;•theft or vandalism of oilfield equipment and supplies, especially in areas of increased activity such as the DJ Basin and Marcellus Shale;•hurricanes, cyclones, windstorms, or “superstorms”, such as Hurricane Sandy which occurred in 2012, which could affect our operations in areas such as the Gulf Coast, deepwater Gulf of Mexico, Marcellus Shale, Eastern Mediterranean or offshore China; •winter storms and snow which could affect our operations in the Rocky Mountain areas;•unseasonably warm weather, which could affect third party gathering and processing facilities, such as occurred in the Rocky Mountain areas during 2012;•volcanoes which could affect our operations offshore Equatorial Guinea;•flooding which could affect our operations in low-lying areas such as the Marcellus Shale; •harsh weather and rough seas offshore the Falkland Islands, which could limit certain exploration activities; and•other natural disasters.Any of these can result in loss of hydrocarbons, environmental pollution and other damage to our properties or the properties of others.Offshore development involves significant operational and financial risks. We have ongoing major development projects in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, offshore West Africa and offshore Eastern Mediterranean. In addition, we are conducting offshore exploration activities in these and other international locations. In certain areas or at certain times, there may be limited availability of suitable drilling rigs, drilling equipment, support vessels, and qualified operating personnel. Deepwater drilling rigs are typically subject to long-term contracts. In addition, frontier areas may lack the physical and oilfield service infrastructure necessary for production and transportation. As a result, development of an offshore discovery, such as Gunflint, Alen, Tamar, or Leviathan, may be a lengthy process and require substantial capital investment. Difficulty and delays in consistently obtaining drilling rigs and other equipment and services at acceptable rates may lead to project delay, increased costs, inability to meet delivery requirements, and/or inability to forecast production, which could prevent the realization of our targeted return on capital or lead to unexpected future losses.Deepwater frontier areas, especially in international locations such as offshore the Falkland Islands, Nicaragua or Sierra Leone, may lack the equipment and services necessary for rapid subsea intervention, containment, capture and shut-in capacity in the case of a well accident or spill. Spill containment and cleanup activities are costly. In addition, the resulting regulatory costs, civil or criminal fines or sanctions, results of third party lawsuits, as well as associated legal and support expenses, including costs to address negative publicity about us, could well exceed the actual costs of containment and cleanup. As a result, a well spill or accident could result in substantial liabilities for us, and have a significant negative impact on our earnings, cash flows, liquidity and financial position.Many offshore areas are subject to hazardous conditions, such as harsh weather and rough seas offshore the Falkland Islands or hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico, which can limit certain exploration or development activities or increase the risk of accident.Development drilling may not result in commercially productive quantities of oil and gas reserves.Our exploration success has provided us with a number of major development projects on which we are moving forward. We depend on these projects to provide long life, sustained cash flows after investment and attractive financial returns. However, development drilling is not always successful and the profitability of development projects may change over time.For example, in new development areas such as the Marcellus Shale, Gunflint, Leviathan or Cyprus Block 12, available data may not allow us to completely know the extent of the reservoir or choose the best locations for drilling development wells. Therefore, a development well we drill may be a dry hole or result in noncommercial quantities of hydrocarbons. Projects in frontier areas may require the development of special technology for development drilling or well completion and we may not have the knowledge or expertise in applying new technology. Our efforts may result in a dry hole or a well that finds noncommercial quantities of hydrocarbons. Development drilling has the same legal and physical risks as exploratory drilling, which can result in the drilling of a development dry hole or the incurrence of substantial development costs without a corresponding increase in proved reserves.42Table of Contents All costs of development drilling and other development activities are capitalized, even if the activities do not result in commercially productive quantities of oil and gas reserves. This puts a property at higher risk for future impairment if commodity prices decrease or operating or development costs increase.Even if development drilling is successful and we find commercial quantities of reserves, we may encounter difficulties or delays in completing development wells. For example, in areas of high activity and demand in which we concentrate, such as the DJ Basin and the Marcellus Shale, we may experience delays in obtaining well completion rigs and services. Frontier areas may not have adequate infrastructure for gathering, processing or transportation, and production may be delayed until they are constructed. This results in a decrease in current cash flows and reduces the return on our investment.Costs of drilling, completing and operating wells are often uncertain, and cost factors can adversely affect the economic viability of a project. Even a development project that is currently economically viable can become uneconomic in the future if commodity prices decrease or operating or development costs increase, resulting in impairment charges and a negative impact on our results of operations.Our operations could be adversely affected by future changes in laws and regulations which may occur as a result of the Deepwater Horizon Incident and other recent incidents. In recent years, several oil spills have highlighted the dangers associated with exploration and production activities in deepwater. In 2010, the drilling rig Deepwater Horizon sank after a blowout and fire. The resulting leak caused a large oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. In 2011, leaks attributed to exploration and production activities occurred offshore the coasts of Brazil and Nigeria and in China's Bohai Bay. In 2012, several workers were injured and some were missing and presumed dead as the result of a fire that erupted on an oil platform in the shallow water Gulf of Mexico, and a drilling rig being towed offshore Alaska broke away from the tugboat and ran aground.In the US, the legislative and regulatory response to the Deepwater Horizon Incident is ongoing. In 2010, the US Department of the Interior issued new rules designed to improve drilling and workplace safety, and various Congressional committees began pursuing legislation to regulate drilling activities and increase liability. In January 2011, the President's National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling released its report, recommending that the federal government require additional regulation and an increase in liability caps. In 2011, the European Commission recommended that new legislation be enacted to enhance the safety of offshore oil and gas activities and, in 2012, established the European Union Offshore Oil and Gas Authorities Group. In the US, additional regulatory review, slower permitting processes and increased oversight have resulted in longer development cycle time for our deepwater Gulf of Mexico projects. Cycle time is the length of time it takes for a project to progress from first discovery to first production, and longer development cycle times could result in lower rates of return on our investments.Increased regulation impacting our activities in the Gulf of Mexico and other deepwater areas could result in extensive efforts to ensure compliance and incremental compliance costs. A significant delay or cancellation of our planned Gulf of Mexico deepwater exploratory activities will reduce our longer term ability to replace reserves, resulting in a negative impact on production over time. To the extent current exploration activities are significantly delayed, a gap could occur in our long-term production profile with a negative impact on our operating results and cash flows. There have also been discussions regarding the establishment of a new industry mutual response fund in which companies would be required to participate and which would be available to pay for clean up and consequential damages arising from an oil spill. Other countries are also considering additional regulation. In the European Union there have been demands for temporary bans on new deepwater drilling and/or additional safety regulation.Future legislation or regulation is also likely to result in substantial increases in civil or criminal fines or sanctions. Such fines or sanctions could well exceed the actual cost of containment and cleanup associated with a well incident or spill. Governmental fines or penalties could also be excessive.We are monitoring legislative and regulatory developments; however, the full legislative and regulatory response to the Deepwater Horizon Incident and other oil spills and accidents is not yet known. Further expansion of safety and performance regulations or an increase in liability for drilling activities, including punitive fines, may have one or more of the following impacts on our business: •increase the costs of drilling exploratory and development wells;•cause delays in, or preclude, the development of our projects in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico or other locations, resulting in longer development cycle times;•result in additional operating costs;•divert our cash flows from capital investments in order to maintain liquidity;43Table of Contents •increase or remove liability caps for claims of damages from oil spills;•increase our share of civil or criminal fines or sanctions for actual or alleged violations if a well incident were to occur; and•limit our ability to obtain additional insurance coverage, at a level that balances the cost of insurance and our desired rates of return, to protect against any increase in liability.Any of the above operating or financial factors may result in a reduction of our cash flows, profitability, and the fair value of our properties or reduce our financial flexibility. Because we strive to achieve certain levels of return on our projects, an increase in our financial responsibility could result in certain of our planned projects becoming uneconomic.The magnitude of our offshore Eastern Mediterranean discoveries will present financial and technical challenges for us due to the large-scale development requirements.We are currently evaluating potential development scenarios for Leviathan and Cyprus Block 12. Due to the scale of these discoveries, realization of their full economic value depends on the ability to export via pipeline or LNG. Each of these development options would require a multi-billion dollar investment and require a number of years to complete.As a result, we have been seeking partners to provide technical and financial support as well as midstream and downstream expertise. In December 2012, we and our existing partners in the Leviathan project announced that we had agreed in principle on a proposal to sell a 30% WI in the Leviathan licenses to Woodside Energy Ltd. (Woodside). The transaction is subject to the negotiations and execution of definitive agreements between the parties, as well as customary approvals, prior to closing. Failure to reach a definitive agreement with Woodside could result in a delay in the Leviathan development project.In Israel, the Interministerial Committee, which was charged with the task of proposing a government policy for developing the natural gas economy in Israel, issued its final report in 2012. We are monitoring the activities of the Interministerial Committee to assess the possible impact, positive or negative, of any resulting laws or regulations on our business. Certain changes in Israel's market, fiscal, and/or regulatory regimes occurring as a result of Interministerial Committee recommendations could delay or reduce the profitability of our Tamar and/or Leviathan development projects and render future exploration and development projects uneconomic.The Israeli Antitrust Commissioner has been reviewing Israel's domestic natural gas sales and ownership in offshore blocks and leases. He has publicly expressed concerns regarding ownership concentration on exploration blocks and development projects and its potential impacts on a competitive domestic natural gas price environment and end user electricity costs. We have cooperated with the Commission's review and, at this time, cannot predict the outcome.Restrictions on resource access or controls over pricing could have a negative impact on our business including reduction on future growth rates, profitability and cash flows.Failure to execute successful development scenarios for Leviathan and Cyprus Block 12 could result in damage to our reputation, limit growth in value and have negative effects on our operating results.Failure of our partners to fund their share of development costs or obtain project financing could result in delay or cancellation of future projects, thus limiting our growth and future cash flows.Some of our major development projects entail significant capital expenditures and have long development cycle times. For example, our joint venture arrangement with CONSOL provides for the long-term development of our Marcellus Shale acreage. In the Eastern Mediterranean, each of our natural gas development options would require a multi-billion dollar investment and span multiple years from sanction to production.As a result, our partners must be able to fund their share of investment costs through the development cycle, through cash flow from operations, external credit facilities, or other sources, including project financing arrangements. Factors which could reduce partners' available cash flows or impair their ability to obtain adequate project financing include, among others:•declines in commodity prices, which reduce revenues and available cash flows;•changes in fiscal regimes impacting royalties, taxes, fees, resource access, or level of government participation in projects;•delay in government project approval, which could have a negative impact on the ability to obtain financing;•downgrades in credit rating or liquidity problems; •increased banking regulation which could reduce access to traditional sources of funding or make funding more expensive; and•regional conflict, which could result in capital market reassessment of risk and withdrawal of capital to more stable areas.44Table of Contents If these issues occurred and impacted our project partners, it could result in a delay or cancellation of a project, resulting in our inability to replace reserves and budgeted production, negatively impacting the timing and receipt of planned cash flows and expected profitability.Our operations require us to comply with a number of US and international laws and regulations, violations of which could result in substantial fines or sanctions and/or impair our ability to do business. Our operations require us to comply with complex and frequently-changing US and international laws and regulations, such as those involving anti-corruption, competition and antitrust, anti-boycott, anti-money laundering, import-export control, marketing, environmental and/or taxation.For example, the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and similar laws and regulations enacted or promulgated by countries pursuant to the 1997 Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Anti-Bribery Convention generally prohibit improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business. The scope and enforcement of anti-corruption laws and regulations may vary. The UK Bribery Act of 2010, which became effective in 2011, is broader in scope than the FCPA and applies to public and private sector corruption and contains no facilitating payments exception. The import/export of equipment and supplies necessary for oil and gas exploration and development activities, as well as the export of crude oil and liquids production are regulated by the import/export laws of the US and other countries in which we operate. In the US, certain items required for oil and gas development activities may be considered “dual-use”, having both commercial and military applications and, therefore, may be subject to greater import or export restrictions. In addition, the US government imposes economic and trade sanctions against certain foreign countries and regimes, such as Iran and Syria. The sanctions are based on US foreign policy and national security goals and may change over time.Mergers of businesses often require the approval of certain government or regulatory agencies and such approval could contain terms, conditions, or restrictions that would be detrimental to our business after a merger. US antitrust laws require waiting periods and even after completion of a merger, governmental authorities could seek to block or challenge a merger as they deem necessary or desirable in the public interest. We have merged with or acquired other companies in the past. Prevention of a merger by antitrust laws could impair our ability to do business.In certain areas, law enforcement may be more robust and enhanced by significant new incentives for whistleblowers. Violations of any laws or regulations caused by either failure of our internal controls related to regulatory compliance or failure of our employees to comply with our internal policies could result in substantial civil or criminal fines, sanctions, or loss of our license to operate. In addition, as we continue to farm-in to exploration opportunities with new partners in new geographical locations, the risk of actual or alleged violation increases. Actual or alleged violations could damage our reputation, be expensive to defend, and impair our ability to do business. Derivatives regulation included in current or proposed financial legislation and rulemaking could impede our ability to manage business and financial risks by restricting our use of derivative instruments as hedges against fluctuating commodity prices and interest rates.The Dodd-Frank Act, which was passed by Congress and signed into law in July 2010, contains significant derivatives regulation, including a requirement that certain transactions be cleared on exchanges and a requirement to post collateral (commonly referred to as “margin”) for such transactions. The Act provides for a potential exception from these clearing and collateral requirements for commercial end-users, such as us, and it includes a number of defined terms that will be used in determining how this exception applies to particular derivative transactions and the parties to those transactions. As required by the Dodd-Frank Act, the Commodities Futures and Trading Commission (CFTC) has promulgated numerous rules to define these terms.In addition, it is possible that the CFTC, in conjunction with prudential regulators, may mandate that financial counterparties entering into swap transactions with end-users must do so with credit support agreements in place, which could result in negotiated credit thresholds above which an end-user must post collateral.We use derivative instruments with respect to a portion of our expected crude oil and natural gas production in order to reduce the impact of commodity price uncertainty and enhance the predictability of cash flows relating to the marketing of our production and in support of our capital investment program. We use interest rate derivative instruments to minimize the impact of interest rate fluctuations associated with anticipated debt issuances. As commodity prices increase or interest rates decrease, our derivative liability positions increase; however, given our current investment grade status, none of our current derivative contracts require the posting of margin or similar cash collateral when there are changes in the underlying commodity prices or interest rates that are referred to in these contracts.Depending on the rules and definitions adopted by the CFTC and prudential regulators, we could be required to post significant amounts of collateral with our dealer counterparties for our derivative transactions. A sudden margin call triggered by rising 45Table of Contents commodity prices or falling interest rates would have an immediate negative impact on our business plan, forcing us to divert capital from exploration, development and production activities. Requirements to post cash collateral could result in negative impacts on our liquidity and financial flexibility and also cause us to incur additional debt and/or reduce capital investment. In addition, a requirement for our counterparties to post collateral would likely result in additional costs being passed on to us, thereby decreasing the effectiveness of our hedges and our profitability. In addition, the final CFTC rules may also require the counterparties to our derivative instruments to spin off some of their derivative activities to a separate entity, which may not be as creditworthy as the current counterparty.Disclosure of certain operating information as required by Section 1504 of the Dodd-Frank Act could have a negative impact on our operations.On August 22, 2012, the SEC issued final rules: Disclosure of Payments by Resource Extraction Issuers (Final Rules), as required by the Dodd-Frank Act. As a result, beginning in 2014, we must provide information about the type and total amount of payments made for each project related to the commercial development of oil, natural gas, or minerals, and the type and total amount of payments made to each government. If these required disclosures conflict with the confidentiality obligations of our subsidiaries or the general laws of the respective countries in which they operate, there could be substantial negative impacts on our operations. Disclosure of certain information could have the following negative impacts, among others, on our operations: •compromise of the security of our employees by subjecting them to detention, arrest, claims of espionage and/or prosecution; •loss of our license to operate in countries where the laws and regulations or terms of production sharing or other contracts prohibit disclosures of certain information, resulting in a reduction in our profitability;•decrease in our ability to compete for new sources of reserves with state-controlled national oil companies or large multi-national companies not subject to disclosures under the Final Rules; and•reduction in profitability and cash flows and a decrease in the price of our common stock.We face various risks associated with global populism.Due in part to the upheaval and uncertainty caused by global economic events including the financial crisis and resulting recession that began in 2008, higher unemployment, and government austerity measures, populist sentiments have risen. Populism is directed against perceived economic and social inequality. During 2012, workers across the European Union, including Spain, Portugal, Greece and Belgium, engaged in strikes and demonstrations to protest cuts in government spending, pensions and entitlements and increases in taxes. In many situations, social media channels have been used to organize protesters and increase public participation.Certain political and non-governmental organizations are promoting "tax fairness", or "fair share". "Tax fairness" claims to create a fair, clear and equivalent tax system for all taxpayers by limiting legislation and rules that benefit one segment of the tax-paying population over another. However, the impact of such changes could be the loss of business incentives and/or increased taxes for individuals or corporations. Populist activities could result in the following:•increased regulation of our business; •increased regulation of the banking industry; and•increased corporate income taxes.Our need to incur costs associated with responding to these developments or complying with any resulting new legal or regulatory requirements resulting from these activities that are substantial and not adequately provided for, could increase our costs of doing business, reduce our financial flexibility and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We face various risks associated with the trend toward increased anti-development activity. Opposition toward oil and gas drilling and development activity has been growing globally. Companies in the oil and gas industry, such as us, are often the target of activist efforts from both individuals and non-governmental organizations regarding safety, human rights, environmental compliance, transparency, anti-corruption, and business practices. Anti-development activists are working to, among other things, reduce access to national and state government lands; delay or cancel certain projects such as offshore drilling, shale development, and pipeline construction; limit or ban the use of hydraulic fracturing; or block activity in sensitive environmental areas such as the Arctic. For example, in 2012, the City of Longmont, Colorado voted to ban hydraulic fracturing activities within city limits. Environmental activists have challenged decisions to grant air-quality permits for offshore drilling and have advocated for increased regulations on shale drilling and hydraulic fracturing in the US. Activists have recently attempted to prevent exploratory drilling in the Arctic.46Table of Contents Activities engaged in by some non-governmental organizations seeking to increase revenue transparency, limit foreign government corruption, increase "tax fairness" or "fair share" payments, or promote income redistribution could result in regulatory changes which could increase our taxes and decrease our profitability. In addition, the use of social media channels can be used to cause rapid, widespread reputational harm.Future activist efforts could result in the following:•delay or denial of drilling permits;•shortening of lease terms or reduction in lease size;•restrictions on installation or operation of gathering or processing facilities;•restrictions on the use of certain operating practices, such as hydraulic fracturing;•reduced access to water supplies or restrictions on water disposal;•limited access or damage to or destruction of our property;•legal challenges or lawsuits;•increased regulation of our business;•damaging publicity about us;•increased costs of doing business;•reduction in demand for our products; and•other adverse effects on our ability to develop our properties and expand production.Our need to incur costs associated with responding to these initiatives or complying with any resulting new legal or regulatory requirements resulting from these activities that are substantial and not adequately provided for, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. A cyber incident could result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption, and/or financial loss. The oil and gas industry has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct day-to-day operations including certain exploration, development and production activities. For example, software programs are used to interpret seismic data, manage drilling rigs, production equipment and gathering and transportation systems, conduct reservoir modeling and reserves estimation, and for compliance reporting. The use of mobile communication devices has increased rapidly. Industrial control systems such as SCADA (supervisory control and data acquisition) now control large scale processes that can include multiple sites and long distances, such as power generation and transmission, communications and oil and gas pipelines.We depend on digital technology, including information systems and related infrastructure as well as cloud application and services, to process and record financial and operating data, communicate with our employees and business partners, analyze seismic and drilling information, estimate quantities of oil and gas reserves and for many other activities related to our business. Our business partners, including vendors, service providers, purchasers of our production, and financial institutions, are also dependent on digital technology. The complexity of the technologies needed to extract oil and gas in increasingly difficult physical environments, such as deepwater, ultra-deepwater and shale, and global competition for oil and gas resources make certain information more attractive to thieves.As dependence on digital technologies has increased, cyber incidents, including deliberate attacks or unintentional events, have also increased. A cyber attack could include gaining unauthorized access to digital systems for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, corrupting data, or causing operational disruption, or result in denial-of-service on websites. For example, in 2012, a wave of network attacks impacted Saudi Arabia's oil industry and breached financial institutions in the US. Certain countries, including China, Russia and Iran, are believed to possess cyber warfare capabilities and are credited with attacks on American companies and government agencies. SCADA-based systems are potentially more vulnerable to cyber attacks due to the increased number of connections with office networks and the internet.Our technologies, systems, networks, and those of our business partners may become the target of cyber attacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of proprietary and other information, or other disruption of our business operations. In addition, certain cyber incidents, such as surveillance, may remain undetected for an extended period.A cyber incident involving our information systems and related infrastructure, or that of our business partners, could disrupt our business plans and negatively impact our operations in the following ways, among others:•unauthorized access to seismic data, reserves information or other sensitive or proprietary information could have a negative impact on our ability to compete for oil and gas resources;•data corruption, communication interruption, or other operational disruption during drilling activities could result in a dry hole cost or even drilling incidents;•data corruption or operational disruption of production infrastructure could result in loss of production, or accidental discharge;47Table of Contents •a cyber attack on a vendor or service provider could result in supply chain disruptions which could delay or halt one of our major development projects, effectively delaying the start of cash flows from the project;•a cyber attack on a third party gathering or pipeline service provider could prevent us from marketing our production, resulting in a loss of revenues;•a cyber attack involving commodities exchanges or financial institutions could slow or halt commodities trading, thus preventing us from marketing our production or engaging in hedging activities, resulting in a loss of revenues;•a cyber attack which halts activities at a power generation facility or refinery using natural gas as feed stock could have a significant impact on the natural gas market, resulting in reduced demand for our production, lower natural gas prices, and reduced revenues;•a cyber attack on a communications network or power grid could cause operational disruption resulting in loss of revenues;•a deliberate corruption of our financial or operational data could result in events of non-compliance which could lead to regulatory fines or penalties; and•business interruptions could result in expensive remediation efforts, distraction of management, damage to our reputation, or a negative impact on the price of our common stock.Although to date we have not experienced any material losses relating to cyber attacks, there can be no assurance that we will not suffer such losses in the future. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities.Federal or state hydraulic fracturing legislation could increase our costs or restrict our access to oil and gas reserves.Hydraulic fracturing using fluids other than diesel is currently exempt from regulation under the federal Safe Drinking Water Act, but opponents of hydraulic fracturing have called for further study of the technique's environmental effects and, in some cases, a moratorium on the use of the technique. In past Congresses, several bills were filed that, if implemented, would have subjected all hydraulic fracturing to regulation under the Safe Drinking Water Act. It is likely that similar bills will be introduced in the current Congress. Further, the EPA's Office of Research and Development (ORD) is conducting a scientific study to investigate the possible relationships between hydraulic fracturing and drinking water. Several states are considering legislation to regulate hydraulic fracturing practices, including restrictions on its use in environmentally sensitive areas. Some municipalities have significantly limited or prohibited drilling activities, or are considering doing so. For example, in November 2012, the City of Longmont, Colorado voted to ban hydraulic fracturing activities within city limits.Although it is not possible at this time to predict the final outcome of the ORD's study or the requirements of any additional federal or state legislation or regulation regarding hydraulic fracturing, any new federal or state, or local restrictions on hydraulic fracturing that may be imposed in areas in which we conduct business, such as the DJ Basin or Marcellus Shale areas, could significantly increase our operating, capital and compliance costs as well as delay or halt our ability to develop oil and gas reserves. See Items 1. and 2. Business and Properties - Hydraulic Fracturing. The marketability of our DJ Basin, Marcellus Shale, and deepwater Gulf of Mexico production is dependent upon transportation and processing facilities over which we may have no control.The marketability of our production from the DJ Basin, Marcellus Shale, and deepwater Gulf of Mexico depends in part upon the availability, proximity and capacity of pipelines, natural gas gathering systems, rail service, and processing facilities. We deliver crude oil and natural gas produced from these areas through gathering systems and pipelines, some of which we do not own. The lack of availability of capacity on third-party systems and facilities could reduce the price offered for our production or result in the shut-in of producing wells or the delay or discontinuance of development plans for properties. Although we have some contractual control over the transportation of our production through firm transportation arrangements, third-party systems and facilities may be temporarily unavailable due to market conditions or mechanical reliability or other reasons, including adverse weather conditions. Activist or other efforts may delay or halt the construction of additional pipelines or facilities.Third-party systems and facilities may not be available to us in the future at a price that is acceptable to us. Any significant change in market factors or other conditions affecting these infrastructure systems and facilities, as well as any delays in constructing new infrastructure systems and facilities, could delay production, thereby harming our business and, in turn, our results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.Restricted land access could reduce our ability to explore for and develop crude oil and natural gas reserves. Our ability to adequately explore for and develop oil and gas resources is affected by a number of factors related to access to land. Examples of factors which reduce our access to land include, among others:48Table of Contents •new municipal or state land use regulations, such as recent changes in setback requirements expected to be approved by the COGCC, which may restrict drilling locations or certain activities such as hydraulic fracturing;•local and municipal government control of land or zoning requirements, which can conflict with state law and deprive land owners of property development rights, such as the recent ban on hydraulic fracturing enacted by the City of Longmont, Colorado;•landowner opposition to infrastructure development, such as recent landowner challenges to the use of eminent domain to gain access to land for the extension of the Keystone pipeline through Texas, or to onshore delivery points in Israel;•regulation of federal land by the BLM, which has proposed rules for hydraulic fracturing on federally-owned land, and which can limit our access to a significant portion of our Nevada acreage;•anti-development activities, which can reduce our access to leases through legal challenges or lawsuits, occupation of drilling sites, or damage to equipment;•disputes regarding leases, such as the Butler v. Powers case in Pennsylvania; and•disputes with landowners, royalty owners, or other operators over such matters as title transfer, joint interest billing arrangements, revenue distribution, or production or cost sharing arrangements.Loss of access to land for which we own mineral rights could result in a reduction in our proved reserves and a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows. Reduced ability to obtain new leases could constrain our future growth and opportunity set by limiting the expansion of our portfolio.Our entry into new exploration ventures in areas in which we have no prior experience subjects us to additional risks.During 2012, we entered into three new, high-potential areas, none of which currently has crude oil or natural gas production: Northeast Nevada, offshore the Falkland Islands, and offshore Sierra Leone. We are also planning to drill our first exploratory well offshore Nicaragua. These arrangements represent entry into new geographical areas in which we have no prior experience. Our activities will be subject to many risks including, among others:•exploration activities in frontier areas may not result in commercially productive quantities of crude oil and natural gas reserves;•exploration activities on federal lands in Northeast Nevada subject us to additional regulatory requirements as compared with such activities conducted on private land;•the remote location of the Falkland Islands makes it more difficult and time-consuming to transport personnel, equipment and supplies; •the operating environment offshore the Falkland Islands, similar to that offshore the Shetland Islands in the North Sea, includes harsh weather and rough seas which could limit seismic and other exploration activities during certain periods; and•there have been numerous acts of piracy, kidnapping, civil strife, regional conflict, cross-border violence, and war, as well as violence associated with corruption, drug trafficking and regime changes in the countries of West Africa which could disrupt our operations offshore Sierra Leone.The people of the Falkland Islands have the right to self-determination, and the Falkland Islands is a United Kingdom Overseas Territory by choice. However, the government of Argentina persists in questioning its status. Actual or perceived threats from Argentina or incursion by Argentina into the Falkland Islands territorial waters could result in disruptions to our planned activities. This risk could be intensified if commercial quantities of oil or natural gas are discovered. We may not be able to compensate for or fully mitigate these risks. Our ability to produce crude oil and natural gas economically and in commercial quantities could be impaired if we are unable to acquire adequate supplies of water for our drilling operations or are unable to dispose of or recycle the water we use economically and in an environmentally safe manner.Drilling activities require the use of water. For example, the hydraulic fracturing process which we employ to produce commercial quantities of crude oil and natural gas from many reservoirs, including the DJ Basin and Marcellus Shale, require the use and disposal of significant quantities of water. In certain areas, there may be insufficient local aquifer capacity to provide a source of water for drilling activities. Water must be obtained from other sources and transported to the drilling site.Our inability to secure sufficient amounts of water, or to dispose of or recycle the water used in our operations, could adversely impact our operations in certain areas. Moreover, the imposition of new environmental initiatives and regulations could include restrictions on our ability to conduct certain operations such as hydraulic fracturing or disposal of waste, including, but not limited to, produced water, drilling fluids and other materials associated with the exploration, development or production of natural gas. 49Table of Contents Compliance with environmental regulations and permit requirements governing the withdrawal, storage and use of surface water or groundwater necessary for hydraulic fracturing of wells may increase our operating costs and cause delays, interruptions or termination of our operations, the extent of which cannot be predicted, all of which could have an adverse effect on our operations and financial condition. See Items 1. and 2. Business and Properties - Hydraulic Fracturing.Our Marcellus Shale joint venture subjects us to certain financial, operational and legal obligations and additional risks associated with development activities in that region. We have committed to make significant capital expenditures in the Marcellus Shale, including a Carried Cost Obligation of approximately $2.1 billion, and have agreed to other operational and legal obligations. If we do not meet our financial commitments or perform our other obligations on a timely basis, our rights to participate in the joint venture, and our anticipated operations in the Marcellus Shale, could be adversely affected.We plan to drill numerous wells in the Marcellus Shale over a multi-year period. These activities will be subject to many risks including, among others:•development drilling in emerging resource plays such as the Marcellus Shale may not result in commercially productive quantities of crude oil and natural gas reserves;•we have less exploration and development experience in the Marcellus Shale than we have in other areas and limited information regarding ultimate recoverable reserves and production decline rates; therefore, our estimates of economically recoverable quantities of crude oil and natural gas reserves may vary substantially and actual production, revenue and expenditures with respect to our reserves likely will vary, possibly materially, from estimates;•the high level of current and planned development activity in the Marcellus Shale may result in increased competition for drilling rigs and oilfield services such as hydraulic fracturing, gathering, processing and/or transportation, thus hindering our ability to develop our reserves and market our production; •activism in New York, Pennsylvania and West Virginia against oil and gas development activities, particularly regarding the use of hydraulic fracturing, could, among other things, delay or limit our access to crude oil and natural gas reserves;•additional environmental regulation or legislation could result in additional development and/or production costs;•potential enactment of severance taxes or additional fees in Pennsylvania, such as the well impact fee enacted by the Pennsylvania legislature in 2012, would likely result in a lower rate of return on our development project; and•our inability to locate sufficient amounts of water, or dispose of or recycle water used in our operations, could hinder our ability to develop our reserves or increase our development and operating costs; and•development activity in the Marcellus Shale places additional burdens on our financial resources and internal financial controls.We may not be able to compensate for or fully mitigate these risks. See Items 1. and 2. Business and Properties - Entry Into Marcellus Shale joint venture.Indebtedness may limit our liquidity and financial flexibility.As of December 31, 2012, we had $4.1 billion of debt, of which $372 million is due within 12 months. Our indebtedness represented 33% of our total book capitalization (sum of debt plus shareholders' equity) at December 31, 2012.Our indebtedness affects our operations in several ways, including the following:•a portion of our cash flows from operating activities must be used to service our indebtedness and is not available for other purposes;•we may be at a competitive disadvantage as compared to similar companies that have less debt;•a covenant contained in our Credit Agreement provides that our total debt to capitalization ratio (as defined) will not exceed 65% at any time, which may limit our ability to borrow additional funds, thereby affecting our flexibility in planning for, and reacting to, changes in the economy and in our industry; •additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate or other purposes may have higher costs and more restrictive covenants;•changes in the credit ratings of our debt may negatively affect the cost, terms, conditions and/or availability of future financing, and lower ratings will increase the interest rate and fees we pay on our revolving credit facility; and•we may be more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions.We may incur additional debt in order to fund our exploration, development and acquisition activities. A higher level of indebtedness increases the risk that our financial flexibility may deteriorate and we may default on our debt obligations. Our ability to meet our debt obligations and service our debt depends on future performance. General economic conditions, crude oil, natural gas, and NGL prices, and financial, business and other factors will affect our operations and our future performance. Many of these factors are beyond our control and we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to pay the interest on our 50Table of Contents debt, and future working capital, borrowings and equity financing may not be available to pay or refinance such debt. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 12. Long-Term Debt.Unavailability of capital resources at reasonable cost could have a negative impact on our liquidity and limit our growth.The capital markets are currently less constrained than they were in the period subsequent to the global economic crisis of 2008. However, certain situations are increasing pressure on the capital markets and could cause funding sources to become constrained again. These situations include:•the European debt crisis persists, with governments and banks requiring more economic assistance;•fiscal situations are also worsening in OECD countries due to lingering effects of recession including slower growth rates;•Basel III banking regulation impacts the amount and nature of capital required to be held by banks;•quantitative easing programs generally weaken the currency of the country launching the stimulus, and discontinuance of such programs can result in spikes in interest rates;•the risk of a potential negative stock market event, such as a sharp price decline or even a “crash”, is intensified by lack of significant improvement in the US fiscal situation and fear that a combination of spending cuts and new taxes could push the country back into recession; and•interest rates could rise if the US debt ceiling is not raised in a timely manner.These situations have a negative impact on the availability and cost of capital. If we or our partners are unable to obtain financing, future development projects could be delayed or canceled, thus limiting our growth and future cash flows.Failure to resolve long-term US fiscal issues, primarily the federal budget deficit and the debt ceiling, could have a negative impact on the economy, slowing growth and reducing demand for our products.In the coming months, the US will face three critical deadlines: on March 1, mandatory across-the-board spending cuts (sequestration) are scheduled to take effect; by late March a new spending bill must be passed to fund the federal government, and in May, the debt ceiling suspension will expire. Congress and the Administration are deeply divided over the issues and there is a lack of consensus on the extent and timing of an increase in the borrowing limit and whether deficit reductions should come from spending cuts, tax increases or a combination of both. In addition, the US government has failed to address increasing entitlement costs and fundamental tax reform. Failure to solve these long term fiscal challenges could undermine the economic recovery, reducing demand and slowing growth. For example:•if the debt ceiling is not raised in a timely manner, the US could default on its debt and/or experience a reduction in its credit rating, and interest rates could increase;•servicing the US debt diverts resources from investments that would spur economic growth;•increased borrowing means that the US government competes with businesses for financing and businesses may be unable to secure funds for expansion; •a federal deficit reduction program, if undertaken too rapidly, could put the economy back into recession; and•austerity measures undertaken to reduce the US deficit could result in increased social unrest, such as is occurring in the European Union.To the extent fiscal issues are not addressed, slower economic growth and a reduction in demand for our products could occur. Such developments could have a significant negative impact on our earnings, cash flows, access to capital, liquidity and financial position. In addition, economic uncertainty makes it more difficult for us to design our exploration and development strategy and related capital investment programs, which are typically formulated years in advance.Our operations may be adversely affected by the European debt crisis.During 2011, the long term structural deficits in numerous European nations coupled with the deterioration of the economic outlook led the weaker nations to a liquidity and solvency crisis. Eurozone leaders have made numerous attempts to solve this debt crisis, but to date a sustainable long term solution has not been implemented and much uncertainty remains. The crisis has had a negative impact on major European banks which historically were significant providers of credit to the energy sector, globally and in the US. In 2012, Cyprus requested a financial rescue in order to recapitalize Cypriot banks, which had been weakened by their exposure to the Greek economy.51Table of Contents Failure to successfully resolve the debt crisis could lead to significant losses for debt holders, including major European banks and investors, triggering additional capital requirements. In the worst case, the crisis could lead to the voluntary exit or expulsion of certain countries from the Euro currency block and/or a collapse of the eurozone financial system. A break up of the eurozone would be a deeply disruptive global economic event. The ongoing crisis continues to have a negative impact on the European economy. A prolonged downturn could disrupt the current US recovery and weaken global trade, hamper key emerging markets such as China and India, and result in another global recession with reduced demand and lower prices for the oil and gas we produce.A eurozone debt crisis could have the following impacts, among others: •disruption of the Euro currency system and/or changes in currency regimes;•disruption of the payment and settlement system; •severe inflation due to currency depreciation;•loss of access to energy markets;•sovereign and corporate defaults on euro-denominated debt;•failures of banks or financial systems or reduced ability of banks to lend due to higher funding costs;•devaluation of assets; and•regional economic recession which could spread globally.The economic developments mentioned above could have a significant negative impact on our earnings, cash flows, access to capital, liquidity and financial position.Increased banking regulation could result in reduced access to traditional sources of funding and limit our growth.In response to the global economic crisis of 2008, banking regulation has increased. New regulation includes the Basel III rules issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and the Final Report of the UK's Independent Commission on Banking (also known as the Vickers Report). These, and other potential regulations being considered by governing bodies in the US and other countries, are expected to impact the amount of capital required to be held by banks and the nature of such capital. As a result, traditional lending practices could change, resulting in more restricted access to funds or reduced availability of funds at rates and terms we consider to be economic. Increased regulation could also negatively impact the project finance market, even for investment grade companies such as we are, and reduce our ability to obtain funding for the capital requirements of future major development projects, such as a potential LNG project. Inability of us and/or our partners to obtain financing could result in delay or cancellation of future development projects, thus limiting our growth and future cash flows.Slower global economic growth rates may materially adversely impact our operating results and financial position.The recovery from the global economic crisis of 2008 and resulting recession has been slow and uneven. Market volatility and reduced consumer demand have increased economic uncertainty, and the current global economic growth rate is slower than what was experienced in the years leading up to the crisis. Many developed countries are constrained by long term structural government budget deficits and international financial markets and credit rating agencies are pressing for budgetary reform and discipline. This need for fiscal discipline is balanced by calls for continuing government stimulus and social spending as a result of the impacts of the global economic crisis. As major countries implement government fiscal reform, such measures, if they are undertaken too rapidly, could further undermine economic recovery, reducing demand and slowing growth. Impacts of the crisis could spread to China and other emerging markets, which have fueled global economic development in recent years, slowing their growth rates, reducing demand, and resulting in further drag on the global economy.Global economic growth drives demand for energy from all sources, including fossil fuels. A lower future economic growth rate is likely to result in decreased demand growth for our crude oil and natural gas production. A decrease in demand, notwithstanding impacts from other factors, could potentially result in lower commodity prices, which would reduce our cash flows from operations, our profitability and our liquidity and financial position.The adoption of GHG emission or other environmental legislation could result in additional operating costs, create delays in our obtaining air pollution permits for new or modified facilities, and reduce demand for the crude oil and natural gas we produce. In recent years, each house of Congress has considered legislation to address GHG emissions, such as the American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009, also known as the Waxman-Markey Bill, passed by the House of Representatives, and The Clean Energy Jobs and American Power Act, or the Boxer-Kerry Bill, introduced to the Senate. Future legislation could include mandatory carbon dioxide emissions goals, measures to encourage use of renewable energy over fossil-based fuels, higher penalties and fines for violations of various environmental laws, or other regulations designed to curb GHG emissions. One measure considered frequently has been the establishment of a “cap and trade” system for restricting GHG emissions in the US. Under such system, certain sources of GHG emissions would be required to obtain GHG emission “allowances” corresponding to their annual emissions of GHGs. The number of emission allowances issued each year would decline as 52Table of Contents necessary to meet overall emission reduction goals. As the number of GHG emission allowances declines each year, the cost or value of allowances would be expected to escalate significantly. The EPA requires regulated facilities and oil and natural gas operators meeting a certain emissions threshold to report GHG emissions. Beyond measuring and reporting, the EPA has issued an “Endangerment Finding” under section 202(a) of the Clean Air Act, concluding GHG pollution threatens the public health and welfare of current and future generations and has indicated that it will use data collected through the reporting rules to decide whether to promulgate future GHG limits. Even if federal GHG legislation or regulation is not adopted, almost one-half of the states have taken action to reduce GHG emissions through the development of GHG emissions inventories and the establishment of regional GHG cap and trade programs. Most of the state-level initiatives have focused on large sources of GHG emissions. It is possible, however, that smaller sources could become subject to state regulation of GHGs.During 2012, approximately 56% of our total crude oil production, 57% of our total natural gas production, and 100% of our NGL production from total consolidated volumes was derived in the US. Therefore, any laws or regulations that may be adopted to restrict or reduce emissions of US GHGs could require us to incur additional operating costs and increase our development cycle time. In addition, we could be required to make significant capital expenditures to comply with new environmental legislation, which would cause us to divert capital from exploration, development and production activities. GHG regulation may make our products less desirable than lower GHG emitting energy sources, such as wind and solar. It is possible, however, that GHG regulation may increase the competitiveness of our products with respect to higher GHG emitting energy sources, such as coal. At this time it is impossible to predict with certainty how a GHG regulation scheme would affect the oil and gas market.We face significant competition and many of our competitors have resources in excess of our available resources.We operate in the highly competitive areas of crude oil and natural gas exploration, exploitation, acquisition and production. We face intense competition from: •large multi-national, integrated oil companies;•state-controlled national oil companies;•US independent oil and gas companies;•service companies engaging in exploration and production activities; and•private oil and gas equity funds.We face competition in a number of areas such as:•seeking to acquire desirable producing properties or new leases for future exploration;•marketing our crude oil and natural gas production;•seeking to acquire the equipment and expertise necessary to operate and develop properties; and•attracting and retaining employees with certain skills.Many of our competitors have financial and other resources substantially in excess of those available to us. Such companies may be able to pay more for seismic and lease rights on crude oil and natural gas properties and exploratory prospects and to define, evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit. This highly competitive environment could have an adverse impact on our business.Exploratory drilling may not result in the discovery of commercially productive reservoirs.We depend on exploration success to provide growth in production and reserves and are planning an active exploratory drilling program in 2013. Exploratory drilling requires significant capital investment and does not always result in commercial quantities of hydrocarbons or new development projects. For example, we incurred dry hole expense in 2012 associated with the Deep Blue exploratory well in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and the Trema exploratory well offshore Cameroon.Exploratory dry holes can occur because seismic data and other technologies we use to determine potential exploratory drilling locations do not allow us to know conclusively prior to drilling a well that crude oil or natural gas is present or may be produced economically. In addition, a well may be successful in locating hydrocarbons, but we and our partners may decide not to develop the prospect due to other considerations. Exploratory drilling activities may be curtailed, delayed or canceled, or development plans may change, resulting in significant exploration expense, as a result of a variety of factors, including:•title problems;•near-term lease expiration;•decisions impacting allocation of capital;•compliance with environmental and other governmental requirements;•increases in the cost of, or shortages or delays in the availability of, drilling rigs, equipment and qualified personnel;53Table of Contents •unexpected drilling conditions;•pressure or other irregularities in formations;•equipment failures or accidents; and•adverse weather conditions.In addition, companies seeking new reserves often face more difficult environments, such as oil sands, deepwater, or ultra-deepwater, and often need to develop or invest in new technologies. This increases cost as well as drilling risk.For certain capital-intensive deepwater Gulf of Mexico or international projects, it may take several years to evaluate the future potential of an exploration well and make a determination of its economic viability, resulting in delays in cash flows from production start-up and a lower return on our investment.Due to our level of planned exploration activity, future dry hole cost could be material and have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows.Estimates of crude oil and natural gas reserves are not precise.There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating crude oil and natural gas reserves and their value, including factors that are beyond our control. Reservoir engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of crude oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner. In accordance with the SEC's rules for oil and gas reserves reporting, our reserves estimates are based on 12-month average prices; therefore, reserves quantities will change when actual prices increase or decrease. The reserves estimates depend on a number of factors and assumptions that may vary considerably from actual results, including:•historical production from the area compared with production from other areas;•the assumed effects of regulations by governmental agencies, including the SEC;•assumptions concerning future crude oil, natural gas, and NGL prices;•anticipated development cycle time;•future development costs; •future operating costs;•impacts of cost recovery provisions in contracts with foreign governments;•severance and excise taxes; and•workover and remedial costs.For these reasons, estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of crude oil and natural gas attributable to any particular group of properties, classifications of those reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of the future net cash flows expected from them prepared by different petroleum engineers or by the same petroleum engineers but at different times may vary substantially. Estimation of crude oil and natural gas reserves in emerging areas or areas with limited historical production, such as onshore US shale areas and offshore areas such as ultra-deepwater Gulf of Mexico, the Eastern Mediterranean or West Africa, is inherently more difficult, and we may have less experience in such areas. Accordingly, reserves estimates may be subject to positive or negative revisions, and actual production, revenue and expenditures with respect to our reserves likely will vary, possibly materially, from estimates.Additionally, because some of our reserves estimates are calculated using volumetric analysis, those estimates are less reliable than the estimates based on a lengthy production history. Volumetric analysis involves estimating the volume of a reservoir based on the net feet of pay of the structure and an estimation of the area covered by the structure. In addition, realization or recognition of proved undeveloped reserves will depend on our development schedule and plans. A change in future development plans for proved undeveloped reserves could cause the discontinuation of the classification of these reserves as proved. See Items 1. and 2. Business and Properties - Proved Reserves Disclosures.We may be unable to make attractive acquisitions, successfully integrate acquired businesses and/or assets, or adjust to the effects of divestitures, causing a disruption to our business.One aspect of our business strategy calls for acquisitions of businesses and assets that complement or expand our current business, such as our Marcellus Shale acquisition in 2011 and our DJ Basin asset acquisition in 2010. This may present greater risks for us than those faced by peer companies that do not consider acquisitions as a part of their business strategy. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to identify attractive acquisition opportunities. Even if we do identify attractive opportunities, we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to complete the acquisition due to capital market constraints, even if such capital is available on commercially acceptable terms. If we acquire an additional business, we could have difficulty integrating its operations, systems, management and other personnel and technology with our own, or could assume unidentified or unforeseeable liabilities, resulting in a loss of value.54Table of Contents We maintain an ongoing portfolio management program which includes sales of non-core, non-strategic assets, such as the sales of certain non-core onshore US and North Sea assets in 2012. These transactions can also result in changes in operations, systems, or management and other personnel.Organizational modifications due to acquisitions, divestitures or other portfolio management actions, or other strategic changes can alter the risk and control environments, disrupt ongoing business, distract management and employees, increase expenses and adversely affect results of operations. Even if these challenges can be dealt with successfully, we cannot provide assurance that the anticipated benefits of any acquisition, divestiture or other strategic change would be realized.We may be unable to dispose of non-core, non-strategic assets on financially attractive terms, resulting in reduced cash proceeds and/or losses.We maintain an ongoing portfolio management program according to which we may divest non-core, non-strategic assets, such as our sale of certain onshore US and North Sea assets in 2012. Asset divestitures can generate organizational and operational efficiencies as well as cash for use in our capital investment program or to repay outstanding debt. We strive to obtain the most attractive prices for our assets. However, various factors can materially affect our ability to dispose of assets on terms acceptable to us. Such factors include current commodity prices, laws and regulations impacting oil and gas operations in the areas where the assets are located, willingness of the purchaser to assume certain liabilities such as asset retirement obligations, our willingness to indemnify buyers for certain matters, and other factors. Inability to achieve a desired price for the assets, or underestimation of amounts of retained liabilities or indemnification obligations, can result in a reduction of cash proceeds, a loss on sale due to an excess of the asset's net book value over proceeds, or liabilities which must be settled in the future at amounts that are higher than we had expected.We operate in a litigious environment.We operate in the US and some other countries which have proven to be litigious environments. Most oil and gas companies, such as us, are involved in various legal proceedings, such as title, royalty, or contractual disputes, in the ordinary course of business. In addition, oil and gas companies are often the target of “legacy lawsuits”. A “legacy lawsuit” refers to a lawsuit by a landowner claiming that oil and gas operations, often performed many years ago and by another operator, caused pollution or contamination of a property. Claims against the current operator may be onerous while not allowing for cleanup at the site. Because we maintain a diversified portfolio of assets that includes both US and international projects, the complexity and types of legal procedures with which we may become involved may vary, and we could incur significant legal and support expenses in different jurisdictions. If we are not able to successfully defend ourselves, there could be a delay or even halt in our exploration, development or production activities or other business plans, resulting in a reduction in reserves, loss of production and reduced cash flows. Legal proceedings could result in a substantial liability and/or negative publicity about us and adversely affect the price of our common stock. In addition, legal proceedings distract management and other personnel from their primary responsibilities. Failure to fund continued capital expenditures could adversely affect our properties.Our exploration, development, and acquisition activities require substantial capital expenditures especially in the case of our major development projects, such as the horizontal Niobrara and Marcellus Shale drilling programs, Gunflint, Alen, and Tamar. Development of LNG terminals or underwater pipelines for export of gas from Leviathan will require a multi-billion dollar investment. In addition, our CONSOL Carried Cost Obligation requires us to pay one-third of CONSOL's working interest share of certain future drilling and completion costs, up to approximately $2.1 billion, generally during periods in which average Henry Hub natural gas prices are above $4.00 per MMBtu. Major offshore projects have a long development cycle time, which means that development spending occurs for several years before the project begins producing and generating cash flows. Historically, we have funded our capital expenditures through a combination of cash flows from operations, our revolving bank credit facility, debt issuances, and occasional sales of non-strategic assets. Future cash flows from operations are subject to a number of variables, such as the level of production from existing wells, prices of crude oil, natural gas and NGLs, and our success in finding, developing and producing new reserves. If revenues were to decrease as a result of lower crude oil, natural gas, or NGL prices or decreased production, and/or our access to debt or capital were limited, we would have a reduced ability to replace our reserves, resulting in lower production over time. If our cash flows from operations are not sufficient to meet our obligations and fund our capital investment program, we may not be able to access capital markets on an economic basis to meet these requirements. If we are not able to fund our capital expenditures, our ownership interests in some properties might be reduced or forfeited as a result. See Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - 2013 Capital Investment Program.55Table of Contents We are exposed to counterparty credit risk as a result of our receivables, hedging transactions and cash investments.We are exposed to risk of financial loss from trade, joint venture, and other receivables. We sell our crude oil, natural gas and NGLs to a variety of purchasers. In addition, we are the operator on a majority of our large joint venture development projects. As operator of the joint ventures, we pay joint venture expenses and make cash calls on our nonoperating partners for their respective shares of joint venture costs. These projects are capital cost intensive and, in some cases, a nonoperating partner may experience a delay in obtaining financing for its share of the joint venture costs. For example our partners in the Eastern Mediterranean must obtain financing for their share of significant development expenditures at Leviathan, which potentially includes an LNG project and/or major underwater pipeline, and offshore Cyprus.In addition, some of our purchasers and joint venture partners are not as creditworthy as we are and may experience credit downgrades or liquidity problems that may hinder their ability to obtain financing. Counterparty liquidity problems could result in a delay in our receiving proceeds from commodity sales or reimbursement of joint venture costs. Credit enhancements have been obtained from some parties in the way of parental guarantees or letters of credit, including our largest crude oil purchaser; however, not all of our trade credit is protected through guarantees or credit support. Nonperformance by a trade creditor or joint venture partner could result in significant financial losses.Our hedging transactions expose us to risk of financial loss if a counterparty fails to perform under a derivative contract. During periods of falling commodity prices, our commodity derivative receivable positions increase, which increases our counterparty credit exposure. We conduct our hedging activities with a diverse group of investment grade major banks and market participants, and we monitor and manage our level of financial exposure. We use master agreements which allow us, in the event of default, to elect early termination of all contracts with the defaulting counterparty. If we choose to elect early termination, all asset and liability positions with the defaulting counterparty would be “net settled” at the time of election. “Net settlement” refers to a process by which all transactions between counterparties are resolved into a single amount owed by one party to the other.We had almost $1.4 billion in cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2012, a majority of which was invested in money market funds and short-term deposits with major financial institutions. We monitor the creditworthiness of the banks and financial institutions with which we invest and review the securities underlying our investment accounts. However, we are unable to predict sudden changes in solvency of our financial institutions. We monitor the creditworthiness of our trade creditors, joint venture partners, hedging counterparties and financial institutions on an ongoing basis. However, if one of them were to experience a sudden change in liquidity, it could impair their ability to perform under the terms of our contracts. We are unable to predict sudden changes in creditworthiness or ability to perform. Even if we do accurately predict sudden changes, our ability to negate the risk may be limited and we could incur significant financial losses.Commodity and interest rate hedging transactions may limit our potential gains.In order to reduce the impact of commodity price uncertainty and increase cash flow predictability relating to the marketing of our crude oil and natural gas, we enter into crude oil and natural gas price hedging arrangements with respect to a portion of our expected production. Our hedges, consisting of a series of derivative instrument contracts, are limited in duration, usually for periods of one to three years. While intended to reduce the effects of volatile crude oil and natural gas prices, such transactions may limit our potential gains if crude oil and natural gas prices rise over the price established by the arrangements.Global commodity prices fluctuated significantly in 2012. Such volatility challenges our ability to forecast and, as a result, it may become more difficult to manage our hedging program. In trying to manage our exposure to commodity price risk, we may end up hedging too much or too little, depending upon how our crude oil or natural gas volumes and our production mix fluctuate in the future. In addition, hedging transactions may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including instances in which our production is less than expected; there is a widening of price basis differentials between delivery points for our production and the delivery point assumed in the hedge arrangement; the counterparties to our futures contracts fail to perform under the contracts; or a sudden unexpected event materially impacts crude oil or natural gas prices. We use interest rate derivative instruments to minimize the impact of interest rate fluctuations associated with anticipated debt issuances. Interest rates are variable and we may also end up hedging too much or too little when we attempt to effectively fix cash flows related to interest payments on an anticipated debt issuance.We have significant international operations and may enter into foreign currency derivative instruments in the future. Currency exchange rates are variable and we may also end up hedging too much or too little when we attempt to mitigate our foreign currency exchange risk.We cannot assure that our hedging transactions will reduce the risk or minimize the effect of volatility in crude oil or natural gas prices, interest rates, or exchange rates. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 10. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.56Table of Contents The insurance we carry is insufficient to cover all of the risks we face, which could result in significant financial exposure. Exploration for and production of crude oil and natural gas can be hazardous, involving natural disasters and other unfortuitous events such as blowouts, well cratering, fire and explosion and loss of well control which can result in damage to or destruction of wells or production facilities, injury to persons, loss of life, or damage to property and the environment. Exploration and production activities are also subject to risk from political developments such as terrorist acts, piracy, civil disturbances, war, expropriation or nationalization of assets, which can cause loss of or damage to our property. As is customary with industry practices, we maintain insurance against many, but not all, potential perils confronting our operations and in coverage amounts and deductible levels that we believe to be economic. Consistent with that profile, our insurance program is structured to provide us financial protection from unfavorable loss severity resulting from damages to or the loss of physical assets or loss of human life, liability claims of third parties, and business interruption (loss of production) attributed to certain assets and including such occurrences as well blowouts and resulting oil spills, at a level that balances cost of insurance with our assessment of risk and our ability to achieve a reasonable rate of return on our investments. Although we believe the coverages and amounts of insurance carried are adequate and consistent with industry practice, we do not have insurance protection against all the risks we face, because we chose not to insure certain risks, insurance is not available at a level that balances the cost of insurance and our desired rates of return, or actual losses exceed coverage limits. We regularly review our risks of loss and the cost and availability of insurance and revise our insurance program accordingly.We expect the future availability and cost of insurance to be impacted by such events as Hurricane Sandy in 2012, the 2011 earthquake and subsequent tsunami in Japan, and the 2010 Deepwater Horizon Incident. Impacts could include: tighter underwriting standards, limitations on scope and amount of coverage, and higher premiums, and will depend, in part, on future changes in laws and regulations regarding exploration and production activities in the Gulf of Mexico and other areas in which we operate, including possible increases in liability caps for claims of damages from oil spills. We will continue to monitor the legislative and regulatory response to the Deepwater Horizon Incident and its impact on the insurance market and our overall risk profile, and adjust our risk and insurance program to provide protection, at a level that we can afford considering the cost of insurance and our desired rates of return, against disruption to our operations and cash flows. If an event occurs that is not covered by insurance or not fully protected by insured limits, it could have a significant adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. See Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Risk and Insurance Program.We are subject to increasing governmental regulations and environmental requirements that may cause us to incur substantial incremental costs.From time to time, in varying degrees, political developments and international, federal and state laws and regulations affect our operations. In particular, price controls, taxes and other laws relating to the crude oil and natural gas industry, changes in these laws and changes in administrative regulations have affected and in the future could affect crude oil and natural gas production, operations and economics. We cannot predict how agencies or courts will interpret existing laws and regulations or the effect these adoptions and interpretations may have on our business or financial condition.Our business is subject to laws and regulations promulgated by international, federal, state and local authorities relating to the exploration for, and the development, production and marketing of, crude oil and natural gas, as well as safety matters. Legal requirements are frequently changed and subject to interpretation and we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance with these requirements or their effect on our operations. We may be required to make substantial expenditures to comply with governmental laws and regulations.Our operations are subject to complex international, federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations including, for example, in the case of federal laws, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, as amended, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended, the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Endangered Species Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, and the Occupational Safety and Health Act. Environmental laws and regulations change frequently and the implementation of new, or the modification of existing, laws or regulations could negatively impact our operations. The discharge of natural gas, crude oil, or other pollutants into the air, soil or water may give rise to substantial liabilities on our part to government agencies and third parties and may require us to incur substantial costs of remediation. In addition, we may incur costs and penalties in addressing regulatory agency procedures involving instances of possible non-compliance. See Items 1. and 2. Business and Properties - Regulations.A change in US energy policy can have a significant impact on our operations and profitability.US energy policy and laws and regulations could change quickly, and substantial uncertainty exists about the nature of many potential rules and regulations that could impact the sources and uses of energy in the US. For example, new Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards enacted in 2012 will result in a rapid increase in the fuel economy of cars and light trucks and could potentially have both a negative impact on demand for crude oil and a positive impact on demand for natural gas for road transport use. GHG emissions regulations could increase the demand for natural gas as fuel for power generation. 57Table of Contents We design our exploration and development strategy and related capital investment programs years in advance. As a result, we are hindered in our ability to plan, invest and respond to potential changes in our business. This can result in a reduction of our cash flows and profitability to the extent we are unable to respond to sudden or significant changes in our operating environment due to changes in US energy policy.The unavailability or high cost of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies, other oil field services and personnel could adversely affect our ability to execute our exploration and development plans on a timely basis and within our budget.Our industry is cyclical and, from time to time, there is a shortage of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies and oilfield services. There may also be a shortage of trained and experienced personnel. During these periods, the costs of such items are substantially greater and their availability may be limited, particularly in areas of high activity and demand in which we concentrate, such as the DJ Basin, Marcellus Shale, deepwater Gulf of Mexico, and in some international locations that typically have limited availability of equipment and personnel, such as West Africa and the Eastern Mediterranean. During periods of increasing levels of industry exploration and production, such as is occurring in the DJ Basin and Marcellus Shale, the demand for, and cost of, drilling rigs and oilfield services increases. The recovery of global crude oil prices during 2011 has resulted in increased exploration and production activity, thus increasing demand pressure for drilling rigs and oilfield services, which could result in sector inflation. In addition, regulatory changes, such as in response to the Deepwater Horizon Incident or related to hydraulic fracturing, may also result in reduced availability and/or higher costs for these rigs and services. As a result, drilling rigs and oilfield services may not be available at rates that provide a satisfactory return on our investment. See Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Contractual Obligations. Provisions in our Certificate of Incorporation and Delaware law may inhibit a takeover of us. Under our Certificate of Incorporation, our Board of Directors is authorized to issue shares of our common or preferred stock without approval of our shareholders. Issuance of these shares could make it more difficult to acquire us without the approval of our Board of Directors as more shares would have to be acquired to gain control. In addition, Delaware law imposes restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15% or more of our outstanding common stock. These provisions may deter hostile takeover attempts that could result in an acquisition of us that would have been financially beneficial to our shareholders.
