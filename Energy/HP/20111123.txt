Item 1A. Risk Factors.   U.S. LAND DRILLING   At the end of September 2011, 2010 and 2009, we had 248, 220 and 201, respectively, of our land rigs available for work in the United States. The total number of rigs at the end of fiscal 2011 increased by a net of 28 rigs from the end of fiscal 2010. The increase is due to 35 new FlexRigs being completed and placed into service, 5 transferred from international operations, 1 rig transferred to international operations, 4 rigs sold during fiscal 2011 and 7 mechanical highly mobile rigs being removed from service. Our U.S. Land operations contributed approximately 83 percent ($2,100.5 million) of our consolidated operating revenues during fiscal 2011, compared with approximately 75 percent ($1,412.5 million) of consolidated operating revenues during fiscal 2010 and approximately 78 percent ($1,441.2 million) of consolidated operating revenues during fiscal 2009. Rig utilization was approximately 86 percent in fiscal 2011 and approximately 73 percent in fiscal 2010, up from approximately 68 percent in fiscal 2009. Our fleet of FlexRigs increased to an average utilization of approximately 99 percent during fiscal 2011, while our conventional and highly mobile rigs had a combined average utilization of approximately 11 percent. A rig is considered to be utilized when it is operated or being mobilized or demobilized under contract. At the close of fiscal 2011, 224 land rigs were working out of 248 available rigs.   OFFSHORE DRILLING   Our Offshore operations contributed approximately 8 percent in fiscal year 2011 ($201.4 million) of our consolidated operating revenue compared to 11 percent in both fiscal years 2010 and 2009 ($202.7 million and $204.7 million, respectively) of our consolidated operating revenues. Rig utilization in fiscal 2011 was approximately 77 percent compared to approximately 80 percent in fiscal 2010 and approximately 89 percent in fiscal 2009. At the end of fiscal 2011, we had eight of our nine offshore platform rigs under contract and continued to work under management contracts for three customer-owned rigs. Revenues from drilling services performed for our largest offshore drilling customer totaled approximately 53 percent of offshore revenues during fiscal 2011.  4                  Table of Contents    International Land Drilling   General    Our International Land operations contributed approximately 9 percent ($226.8 million) of our consolidated operating revenues during fiscal 2011, compared with approximately 13 percent ($247.2 million) of consolidated operating revenues during fiscal 2010 and 10 percent ($187.1 million) in fiscal 2009. Rig utilization in fiscal 2011 was 70 percent, 71 percent in fiscal 2010 and 70 percent in fiscal 2009.    Argentina    At the end of fiscal 2011, we had nine rigs in Argentina. Our utilization rate was approximately 49 percent during fiscal 2011, approximately 53 percent during fiscal 2010 and approximately 52 percent during fiscal 2009. Revenues generated by Argentine drilling operations contributed approximately 2 percent ($44.2 million) of our consolidated operating revenues during fiscal 2011 compared with approximately 3 percent ($55.9 million) in fiscal 2010 and 2 percent ($42.1 million) in fiscal 2009. Revenues from drilling services performed for our two largest customers in Argentina totaled approximately 1 percent of consolidated operating revenues and approximately 15 percent of international operating revenues during fiscal 2011. The Argentine drilling contracts are primarily with large international or national oil companies.    Colombia    At the end of fiscal 2011, we had six rigs in Colombia. Our utilization rate was approximately 83 percent during fiscal 2011, approximately 71 percent during fiscal 2010 and approximately 88 percent during fiscal 2009. Revenues generated by Colombian drilling operations contributed approximately 3 percent of our consolidated operating revenues during fiscal 2011 and 2010 ($74.5 million and $57.5 million in fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively), compared with 4 percent ($77.3 million) of our consolidated operating revenues during fiscal 2009. Revenues from drilling services performed for our largest customer in Colombia totaled approximately 1 percent of consolidated operating revenues and approximately 12 percent of international operating revenues during fiscal 2011. The Colombian drilling contracts are primarily with large international or national oil companies.    Ecuador    At the end of fiscal 2011, we had four rigs in Ecuador. The utilization rate in Ecuador was 85 percent in fiscal 2011, compared to 100 percent in fiscal 2010 and 2009. Revenues generated by Ecuadorian drilling operations contributed approximately 2 percent ($42.6 million) of our consolidated operating revenues during fiscal 2011 compared with approximately 3 percent in both fiscal years 2010 and 2009 ($52.1 million and $52.3 million in fiscal 2010 and 2009, respectively). Revenues from drilling services performed for the largest customer in Ecuador totaled approximately 1 percent of consolidated operating revenues and approximately 13 percent of international operating revenues during fiscal 2011. The Ecuadorian drilling contracts are primarily with large international or national oil companies.    Other Locations    In addition to our operations discussed above, at the end of fiscal 2011 we had two rigs in Tunisia, and three rigs in Bahrain. An additional rig is en route to Bahrain subsequent to September 30, 2011.   FINANCIAL   Information relating to revenues, total assets and operating income by reportable operating segments may be found on, and is incorporated by reference to, pages 71 through 75 of our Annual Report (Exhibit 13 to this Form 10-K).   EMPLOYEES   We had 7,694 employees within the United States (17 of which were part-time employees) and 1,030 employees in international operations as of September 30, 2011.  5        Table of Contents   AVAILABLE INFORMATION   Information relating to our internet address and information relating to our Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") filings may be found on, and is incorporated by reference to, page 77 of our Annual Report (Exhibit 13 to this Form 10-K).       Item 1A. RISK FACTORS    In addition to the risk factors discussed elsewhere in this Report, we caution that the following "Risk Factors" could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.   Our offshore and land operations are subject to a number of operational risks, including environmental and weather risks, which could expose us to significant losses and damage claims. We are not fully insured against all of these risks and our contractual indemnity provisions may not fully protect us.   Our drilling operations are subject to the many hazards inherent in the business, including inclement weather, blowouts, well fires, loss of well control, pollution, and reservoir damage. These hazards could cause significant environmental damage, personal injury, suspension of drilling operations, serious damage or destruction of equipment and property and substantial damage to producing formations and surrounding lands and waters. Our offshore drilling operations are also subject to potentially greater environmental liability, including pollution of offshore waters and related negative impact on wildlife and habitat, adverse sea conditions and platform damage or destruction due to collision with aircraft or marine vessels. Our offshore operations may also be negatively affected by blowouts or uncontrolled release of oil by third parties whose offshore operations are unrelated to our operations. We operate several platform rigs in the Gulf of Mexico. The Gulf of Mexico experiences hurricanes and other extreme weather conditions on a frequent basis, the frequency of which may increase with any climate change. Damage caused by high winds and turbulent seas could potentially curtail operations on such platform rigs for significant periods of time until the damage can be repaired. Moreover, even if our platform rigs are not directly damaged by such storms, we may experience disruptions in operations due to damage to customer platforms and other related facilities in the area. We have a new-build rig assembly facility located near the Houston, Texas ship channel, and our principal fabricator and other vendors are also located in the gulf coast region. Due to their location, these facilities are exposed to potentially greater hurricane damage.   We have indemnification agreements with many of our customers and we also maintain liability and other forms of insurance. In general, our drilling contracts contain contractual rights to indemnity from our customer for, among other things, pollution and reservoir damage. However, our contractual rights to indemnification may be unenforceable or limited due to negligent or willful acts of commission or omission by us, our subcontractors and/or suppliers. Our customers may dispute, or be unable to meet, their contractual indemnification obligations to us. Accordingly, we may be unable to transfer these risks to our drilling customers by contract or indemnification agreements. Incurring a liability for which we are not fully indemnified or insured could have a material adverse effect our business, financial condition and results of operations.   With the exception of "named wind storm" risk in the Gulf of Mexico, we insure rigs and related equipment at values that approximate the current replacement cost on the inception date of the policy. However, we self-insure our deductible as well as a significant portion of the estimated replacement cost of our offshore rigs and our land rigs and equipment. We also carry insurance with varying deductibles and coverage limits with respect to offshore platform rigs and "named wind storm" risk in the Gulf of Mexico.   We have insurance coverage for comprehensive general liability, automobile liability, worker's compensation and employer's liability, and certain other specific risks. Insurance is purchased over deductibles to reduce our exposure to catastrophic events. We retain a significant portion of our expected losses under our worker's compensation, general liability and automobile liability programs. The Company self-insures a number of other risks including loss of earnings and business interruption. We are unable to obtain significant amounts of insurance to cover risks of underground reservoir damage; however, we are generally indemnified under our drilling contracts from this risk.   If a significant accident or other event occurs and is not fully covered by insurance or an enforceable or recoverable indemnity from a customer, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial  6        Table of Contents   condition and results of operations. Our insurance will not in all situations provide sufficient funds to protect us from all liabilities that could result from our drilling operations. Our coverage includes aggregate policy limits. As a result, we retain the risk for any loss in excess of these limits. No assurance can be given that all or a portion of our coverage will not be cancelled during fiscal 2012, that insurance coverage will continue to be available at rates considered reasonable or that our coverage will respond to a specific loss. Further, we may experience difficulties in collecting from our insurers or our insurers may deny all or a portion of our claims for insurance coverage.   Oil and natural gas prices are volatile, and low prices could negatively affect our financial results in the future.   Our operations can be materially affected by low oil and gas prices. We believe that any significant reduction in oil and gas prices could depress the level of exploration and production activity and result in a corresponding decline in demand for our services. Worldwide military, political and economic events, including initiatives by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, may affect both the demand for, and the supply of, oil and gas. Fluctuations during the last few years in the demand and supply of oil and gas have contributed to, and are likely to continue to contribute to, price volatility. Any prolonged reduction in demand for our services could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.   A sluggish global economy may affect our business.   As a result of volatility in oil and natural gas prices and a continuing sluggish global economic environment, we are unable to determine whether our customers will maintain spending on exploration and development drilling or whether customers and/or vendors and suppliers will be able to access financing necessary to sustain their current level of operations, fulfill their commitments and/or fund future operations and obligations. The current global economic environment may impact industry fundamentals and result in reduced demand for drilling rigs. These conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.   The contract drilling business is highly competitive.   Competition in contract drilling involves such factors as price, rig availability, efficiency, condition and type of equipment, reputation, operating safety, environmental impact, and customer relations. Competition is primarily on a regional basis and may vary significantly by region at any particular time. Land drilling rigs can be readily moved from one region to another in response to changes in levels of activity, and an oversupply of rigs in any region may result, leading to increased price competition.   Although many contracts for drilling services are awarded based solely on price, we have been successful in establishing long-term relationships with certain customers which have allowed us to secure drilling work even though we may not have been the lowest bidder for such work. We have continued to attempt to differentiate our services based upon our FlexRigs and our engineering design expertise, operational efficiency, safety and environmental awareness. This strategy is less effective when lower demand for drilling services intensifies price competition and makes it more difficult or impossible to compete on any basis other than price. Also, future improvements in operational efficiency and safety by our competitors could negatively affect our ability to differentiate our services.   The loss of one or a number of our large customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.   In fiscal 2011, we received approximately 57 percent of our consolidated operating revenues from our ten largest contract drilling customers and approximately 32 percent of our consolidated operating revenues from our three largest customers (including their affiliates). We believe that our relationship with all of these customers is good; however, the loss of one or more of our larger customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  7        Table of Contents    International uncertainties and local laws could adversely affect our business.   International operations are subject to certain political, economic and other uncertainties not encountered in U.S. operations, including increased risks of terrorism, kidnapping of employees, expropriation of equipment as well as expropriation of a particular oil company operator's property and drilling rights, taxation policies, foreign exchange restrictions, currency rate fluctuations and general hazards associated with foreign sovereignty over certain areas in which operations are conducted. On June 30, 2010, the Venezuelan government seized 11 rigs and associated real and personal property owned by our Venezuelan subsidiary.   There can be no assurance that there will not be changes in local laws, regulations and administrative requirements or the interpretation thereof which could have a material adverse effect on the profitability of our operations or on our ability to continue operations in certain areas. Because of the impact of local laws, our future operations in certain areas may be conducted through entities in which local citizens own interests and through entities (including joint ventures) in which we hold only a minority interest or pursuant to arrangements under which we conduct operations under contract to local entities. While we believe that neither operating through such entities nor pursuant to such arrangements would have a material adverse effect on our operations or revenues, there can be no assurance that we will in all cases be able to structure or restructure our operations to conform to local law (or the administration thereof) on terms we find acceptable.   Although we attempt to minimize the potential impact of such risks by operating in more than one geographical area, during fiscal 2011, approximately 9 percent of our consolidated operating revenues were generated from the international contract drilling business. During fiscal 2011, approximately 71 percent of the international operating revenues were from operations in South America. All of the South American operating revenues were from Argentina, Colombia and Ecuador.   We depend on a limited number of vendors, some of which are thinly capitalized and the loss of any of which could disrupt our operations.   Certain key rig components are either purchased from or fabricated by a single or limited number of vendors, and we have no long-term contracts with many of these vendors. Shortages could occur in these essential components due to an interruption of supply or increased demands in the industry. If we are unable to procure certain of such rig components, we would be required to reduce our rig construction or other operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.   If our principal fabricator, located on the Texas gulf coast, was unable or unwilling to continue fabricating rig components, then we would have to transfer this work to other acceptable fabricators. This transfer could result in significant delay in the completion of new FlexRigs. Any significant interruption in the fabrication of rig components could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.   Certain key rig components are obtained from vendors that are, in some cases, thinly capitalized, independent companies that generate significant portions of their business from us or from a small group of companies in the energy industry. These vendors may be disproportionately affected by any loss of business, downturn in the energy industry or reduction or unavailability of credit. Therefore, disruptions in rig component delivery may occur, and such disruptions and terminations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  8                  Table of Contents   Our securities portfolio may lose significant value due to a decline in equity prices and other market-related risks, thus impacting our debt ratio and financial strength.   At September 30, 2011, we had a portfolio of securities with a total fair value of $348 million. These securities are subject to a wide variety of market-related risks that could substantially reduce or increase the fair value of our holdings. Except for investments in limited partnerships carried at cost, the portfolio is recorded at fair value on our balance sheet with changes in unrealized after-tax value reflected in the equity section of our balance sheet. Any reduction in fair value would have an impact on our debt ratio and financial strength. At November 17, 2011, the fair value of the portfolio had increased to approximately $431.2 million.   Government regulations and environmental laws could adversely affect our business.   Many aspects of our operations are subject to government regulation, including those relating to drilling practices, pollution, disposal of hazardous substances and oil field waste. The United States and various other countries have environmental regulations which affect drilling operations. The cost of compliance with these laws could be substantial. A failure to comply with these laws and regulations could expose us to substantial civil and criminal penalties. In addition, environmental laws and regulations in the United States impose a variety of requirements on "responsible parties" related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages from such spills. As an owner and operator of drilling rigs, we may be deemed to be a responsible party under these laws and regulations.   We believe that we are in substantial compliance with all legislation and regulations affecting our operations in the drilling of oil and gas wells and in controlling the discharge of wastes. To date, compliance costs have not materially affected our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position, although compliance measures may add to the costs of drilling operations. Additional legislation or regulation may reasonably be anticipated, and the effect thereof on our operations cannot be predicted.   Regulation of greenhouse gases and climate change could have a negative impact on our business.   Some scientific studies have suggested that emissions of certain gases, commonly referred to as "greenhouse gases" ("GHGs") and including carbon dioxide and methane, may be contributing to warming of the Earth's atmosphere and other climatic changes. In response to such studies, the issue of climate change and the effect of GHG emissions, in particular emissions from fossil fuels, is attracting increasing attention worldwide. We are aware of the increasing focus of local, state, national and international regulatory bodies on GHG emissions and climate change issues. The United States Congress is considering legislation to reduce GHG emissions. Although it is not possible at this time to predict whether proposed legislation or regulations will be adopted, any such future laws and regulations could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions. Any additional costs or operating restrictions associated with legislation or regulations regarding GHG emissions could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.   New legislation and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays.   Members of the U.S Congress and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, or the EPA, are reviewing more stringent regulation of hydraulic fracturing, a technology which involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into rock formations to stimulate oil and natural gas production. Both the U.S. Congress and the EPA are studying whether there is any link between hydraulic fracturing and soil or ground water contamination or any impact on public health. Legislation has been introduced before Congress to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the fracturing process. In addition, some states have and others are considering adopting regulations that could restrict hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances. In the event we engage in any hydraulic fracturing activities, any new laws, regulation or permitting requirements regarding hydraulic fracturing could lead to operational delays, increased operating costs or third party or governmental claims, additional burdens that could serve to delay or limit the drilling services we provide to third parties whose drilling operations could be impacted by these regulations, increased costs of compliance and doing  9      Table of Contents  business, or delay in the development of unconventional gas resources from shale formations which are not commercial without the use of hydraulic fracturing.   Our business and results of operations may be adversely affected by foreign currency devaluation.   Contracts for work in foreign countries generally provide for payment in U.S. dollars; however, government-owned petroleum companies may in the future require that a greater proportion of these payments be made in local currencies. Based upon current information, we believe that our exposure to potential losses from currency devaluation in foreign countries is immaterial. However, in the event of future payments in local currencies or an inability to exchange local currencies for U.S. dollars, we may incur currency devaluation losses which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.   Fixed term contracts may in certain instances be terminated without an early termination payment.   Fixed term drilling contracts customarily provide for termination at the election of the customer, with an "early termination payment" to be paid to us if a contract is terminated prior to the expiration of the fixed term. However, under certain limited circumstances, such as destruction of a drilling rig, our bankruptcy, sustained unacceptable performance by us or delivery of a rig beyond certain grace and/or liquidated damage periods, no early termination payment would be paid to us. Even if an early termination payment is owed to us, the current global economic environment may affect the customer's ability to pay the early termination payment.   Shortages of drilling equipment and supplies could adversely affect our operations.   The contract drilling business is highly cyclical. During periods of increased demand for contract drilling services, delays in delivery and shortages of drilling equipment and supplies can occur. These risks are intensified during periods when the industry experiences significant new drilling rig construction or refurbishment. Any such delays or shortages could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.   New technologies may cause our drilling methods and equipment to become less competitive, resulting in an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.   Although we take measures to ensure that we use advanced oil and natural gas drilling technology, changes in technology or improvements in competitors' equipment could make our equipment less competitive or require significant capital investments to keep our equipment competitive. Any such changes in technology could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.   Competition for experienced personnel may negatively impact our operations or financial results.   We utilize highly skilled personnel in operating and supporting our businesses. In times of high utilization, it can be difficult to retain, and in some cases find, qualified individuals. Although to date our operations have not been materially affected by competition for personnel, an inability to obtain or find a sufficient number of qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.   Improvements in or new discoveries of alternative energy technologies could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.   Since our business depends on the level of activity in the oil and natural gas industry, any improvement in or new discoveries of alternative energy technologies that increase the use of alternative forms of energy and reduce the demand for oil and natural gas could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  10      Table of Contents       Item 1B.
