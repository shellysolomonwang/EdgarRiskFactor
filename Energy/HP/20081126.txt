Item 1A. Risk Factors."  3                 Table of Contents   The following table sets forth the total backlog by reportable segment as of October 31, 2008 and 2007, and the percentage of the October 31, 2008 backlog not reasonably expected to be filled in fiscal 2009:                    Total Backlog Revenue            Percentage Not Reasonably Expected to be Filled in Fiscal 2009    Reportable Segment     10/31/2008    10/31/2007        (in millions)        U.S. Land   $ 2,876   $ 1,696   64.1%    Offshore     199     234   75.1%    International     299     39   78.4%                       $ 3,374   $ 1,969                         U.S. LAND DRILLING   At the end of September 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company had 185, 157 and 113 respectively, of its land rigs available for work in the United States. The total number of rigs at the end of fiscal 2008 increased by a net of 28 rigs from the end of fiscal 2007, resulting from new FlexRigs placed into service. The Company's U.S. land operations contributed approximately 76 percent ($1,542.0 million) of the Company's consolidated operating revenues during fiscal 2008, compared with approximately 72 percent ($1,174.9 million) of consolidated operating revenues during fiscal 2007 and approximately 68 percent ($829.1 million) of consolidated operating revenues during fiscal 2006. Rig utilization in fiscal 2008 was approximately 96 percent, down from approximately 97 percent in fiscal 2007 and 99 percent in 2006. The Company's fleet of FlexRigs and highly mobile rigs maintained an average utilization of approximately 98 percent during fiscal 2008 while the Company's conventional rigs had an average utilization rate of approximately 80 percent. A rig is considered to be utilized when it is operated or being moved, assembled or dismantled under contract. At the close of fiscal 2008, 182 land rigs were working out of 185 available rigs.   OFFSHORE DRILLING   The Company's offshore operations contributed approximately 8 percent ($154.5 million in fiscal 2008 and $123.1 million in fiscal 2007) of the Company's consolidated operating revenues during both fiscal years, compared to approximately 13 percent ($154.5 million) of the Company's consolidated operating revenues during fiscal 2006. Rig utilization in fiscal 2008 was approximately 75 percent, up from approximately 65 percent in fiscal 2007 and 69 percent in 2006. At the end of fiscal 2008, the Company had eight of its nine offshore platform rigs under contract and continued to work under management contracts for three customer-owned rigs. The management contract for one rig located offshore Equatorial Guinea terminated in early fiscal 2008 but the Company has continued under a standby contract. The Company is currently negotiating a new long-term contract in Equatorial Guinea, and the Company anticipates returning to a full dayrate in fiscal 2010. Revenues from drilling services performed for the Company's largest offshore drilling customer totaled approximately 40 percent of offshore revenues during fiscal 2008.   INTERNATIONAL LAND DRILLING    General    The Company's international land operations contributed approximately 16 percent ($328.2 million) of the Company's consolidated operating revenues during fiscal 2008, compared with approximately 20 percent ($320.3 million) of consolidated operating revenues during fiscal 2007 and 19 percent ($230.8 million) in fiscal 2006. Rig utilization in fiscal 2008 was 82 percent and 90 percent in fiscal 2007 and 2006.    Venezuela    Venezuelan operations continue to be a significant part of the Company's operations. The Company worked exclusively for the Venezuelan state petroleum company, PDVSA and a PDVSA-owned affiliate, during fiscal 2008 and revenues from this work accounted for approximately 51 percent of international operating revenues. Revenues generated from Venezuelan drilling operations contributed approximately  4      Table of Contents 8 percent ($167.2 million in fiscal 2008 and $127.3 million in fiscal 2007) of the Company's consolidated operating revenues for both fiscal years compared to approximately 7 percent ($84.6 million) of consolidated operating revenues during fiscal 2006. The Company had 11 rigs working in Venezuela at the end of fiscal 2008.   The Company's rig utilization rate in Venezuela increased from approximately 92 percent during fiscal 2007 to approximately 97 percent in fiscal 2008. Rig utilization in 2006 was 83 percent.    Ecuador    At the end of fiscal 2008, the Company had four rigs in Ecuador. During fiscal 2008, the Company transferred two rigs from Ecuador to Colombia and sold two rigs that had been idle. The Company's utilization rate was 59 percent during fiscal 2008, down from 89 percent in fiscal 2007 and 100 percent in fiscal 2006. Revenues generated by Ecuadorian drilling operations contributed approximately 3 percent ($55.1 million) of the Company's consolidated operating revenues during fiscal 2008, as compared with approximately 6 percent ($93.9 million) of consolidated operating revenues during fiscal 2007 and approximately 7 percent ($88.7 million) of consolidated operating revenues during fiscal 2006. Revenues from drilling services performed for the Company's largest customer in Ecuador totaled approximately 1 percent of consolidated operating revenues and approximately 6 percent of international operating revenues during fiscal 2008. The Ecuadorian drilling contracts are primarily with large international or national oil companies.    Other Locations    In addition to its operations in Venezuela and Ecuador, at the end of fiscal 2008, the Company had five rigs in Argentina, five rigs in Colombia and one rig in Tunisia. Additionally, four new FlexRigs were completed and ready for delivery at September 30, 2008.   At the end of October 2008, all rigs in Argentina, Colombia and Tunisia were fully contracted. Two FlexRigs were mobilized to Colombia and commenced operations. Five FlexRigs, including the three rigs completed as of September 30, 2008, are scheduled to be mobilized to Argentina during fiscal 2009.   FINANCIAL   Information relating to revenues, total assets and operating income by reportable operating segments may be found on, and is incorporated by reference to, pages 77 through 81 of the Company's Annual Report (Exhibit 13 to this Form 10-K).   EMPLOYEES   The Company had 6,198 employees within the United States (14 of which were part-time employees) and 1,172 employees in international operations as of September 30, 2008.   AVAILABLE INFORMATION   Information relating to the Company's internet address and the Company's SEC filings may be found on, and is incorporated by reference to, page 83 of the Company's Annual Report (Exhibit 13 to this Form 10-K).       Item 1A. RISK FACTORS    In addition to the risk factors discussed elsewhere in this Report, the Company cautions that the following "Risk Factors" could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.   A deteriorating global economy may affect the Company's business.   As a result of recent volatility in oil and natural gas prices and substantial uncertainty in the capital markets due to the deteriorating global economic environment, the Company is unable to determine whether its customers will reduce spending on exploration and development drilling or whether customers  5      Table of Contents  and/or vendors and suppliers will be able to access financing necessary to sustain their current level of operations, fulfill their commitments and/or fund future operations and obligations. The deteriorating global economic environment may impact industry fundamentals, and the potential resulting decrease in demand for drilling rigs could cause the drilling industry to cycle into a downturn. These conditions could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business.   The contract drilling business is highly competitive.   Competition in contract drilling involves such factors as price, rig availability, efficiency, condition and type of equipment, reputation, operating safety, and customer relations. Competition is primarily on a regional basis and may vary significantly by region at any particular time. Land drilling rigs can be readily moved from one region to another in response to changes in levels of activity, and an oversupply of rigs in any region may result, leading to increased price competition.   Although many contracts for drilling services are awarded based solely on price, the Company has been successful in establishing long-term relationships with certain customers which have allowed the Company to secure drilling work even though the Company may not have been the lowest bidder for such work. The Company has continued to attempt to differentiate its services based upon its FlexRigs and its engineering design expertise, operational efficiency, safety and environmental awareness. This strategy is less effective when lower demand for drilling services intensifies price competition and makes it more difficult or impossible to compete on any basis other than price. Also, future improvements in operational efficiency and safety by the Company's competitors could negatively affect the Company's ability to differentiate its services.   The Company's operations are subject to a number of operational risks, including weather.   The drilling operations of the Company are subject to the many hazards inherent in the business, including inclement weather, blowouts and well fires. These hazards could cause personal injury, suspend drilling operations, seriously damage or destroy the equipment involved and cause substantial damage to producing formations and the surrounding areas. The Company's offshore drilling operations are also subject to potentially greater environmental liability, adverse sea conditions and platform damage or destruction due to collision with aircraft or marine vessels. Specifically, the Company operates several platform rigs in the Gulf of Mexico. The Gulf of Mexico experiences hurricanes and other extreme weather conditions on a frequent basis. Damage caused by high winds and turbulent seas could potentially curtail operations on such platform rigs for significant periods of time until the damage can be repaired. Moreover, even if the Company's platform rigs are not directly damaged by such storms, the Company may experience disruptions in operations due to damage to customer platforms and other related facilities in the area.   The Company has a new-build rig assembly facility located near the Houston, Texas ship channel. Also, the Company's principal fabricator and other vendors are located in the gulf coast region. Due to their location, these facilities are exposed to potentially greater hurricane damage.   Fixed-term contracts may in certain instances be terminated without an early termination payment.   Fixed-term drilling contracts customarily provide for termination at the election of the customer, with an "early termination payment" to be paid to the Company if a contract is terminated prior to the expiration of the fixed term. However, under certain limited circumstances, such as destruction of a drilling rig, bankruptcy of the Company, sustained unacceptable performance by the Company or delivery of a rig beyond certain grace and/or liquidated damage periods, no early termination payment would be paid to the Company. Even if an early termination payment is owed to the Company, the recent deteriorating global economy may affect the customer's ability to pay the early termination payment.   The Company's operations present risks of loss that, if not insured or indemnified against, could adversely affect our results of operations.   The Company insures its rigs and equipment at estimated replacement cost at the inception of the policy. The Company self-insures a $1 million per occurrence deductible, as well as 10 percent of the estimated replacement cost of offshore rigs and 30 percent of the estimated replacement cost of its land  6      Table of Contents  rigs and equipment. Damage from named wind storms is limited to $100 million in the aggregate and the per occurrence deductible increases to $3.5 million. Rig property insurance coverage expires in May 2009. No insurance is carried against loss of earnings or business interruption. The Company is unable to obtain significant amounts of insurance to cover risks of underground reservoir damage; however, the Company is generally indemnified under its drilling contracts from this risk.   The Company has insurance coverage for comprehensive general liability, automobile liability, worker's compensation and employer's liability. Generally, casualty deductibles are $1 million or $2 million per occurrence, depending on whether a claim occurs inside or outside of the United States. The Company maintains certain other insurance coverages with deductibles as high as $5 million. Insurance is purchased over deductibles to reduce the Company's exposure to catastrophic events. The Company retains a significant portion of its expected losses under its worker's compensation, general liability and automobile liability programs. The Company records estimates for incurred outstanding liabilities for unresolved worker's compensation, general liability and for claims that are incurred but not reported. Estimates are based on adjuster estimates, historical experience or statistical methods that the Company believes are reliable. Nonetheless, insurance estimates include certain assumptions and management judgments regarding the frequency and severity of claims, claim development and settlement practices. Unanticipated changes in these factors may produce materially different amounts of expense that would be reported under these programs.   No assurance can be given that all or a portion of the Company's coverage will not be cancelled during fiscal 2009 or that insurance coverage will continue to be available at rates considered reasonable. No assurance can be given that the Company's insurance and indemnification arrangements will adequately protect it against all liabilities that could result from the hazards of its drilling operations. Incurring a liability for which the Company is not fully insured or indemnified could materially affect the Company's results of operations.   Shortages of drilling equipment and supplies could adversely affect our operations.   The contract drilling business is highly cyclical. During periods of increased demand for contract drilling services, delays in delivery and shortages of drilling equipment and supplies can occur. These risks are intensified during periods when the industry experiences significant new drilling rig construction or refurbishment. Any such delays or shortages could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.   The Company depends on a limited number of thinly capitalized vendors, the loss of any of which could disrupt the Company's operations.   Certain key rig components are either purchased from or fabricated by a single or limited number of vendors, and the Company has no long-term contracts with many of these vendors. Shortages could occur in these essential components due to an interruption of supply or increased demands in the industry. If the Company was unable to procure certain of such rig components, it would be required to reduce its rig construction or other operations, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.   If the Company's principal fabricator, located on the Texas gulf coast, was unable or unwilling to continue fabricating rig components, then the Company would have to transfer this work to other acceptable fabricators. This transfer could result in significant delay in the completion of new FlexRigs. Any significant interruption in the fabrication of rig components could have a material adverse impact on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.   Certain key rig components are obtained from vendors that are, in some cases, thinly capitalized, independent companies that generate significant portions of their business from the Company or from a small group of companies in the energy industry. These vendors may be disproportionately affected by any loss of business, downturn in the energy industry or reduction or unavailability of credit. Therefore, disruptions in rig component delivery may occur, and such disruptions and terminations could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.  7                Table of Contents   Oil and natural gas prices are volatile, and low prices could negatively affect our financial results in the future.   The Company's operations can be materially affected by low oil and gas prices. The Company believes that any significant reduction in oil and gas prices could depress the level of exploration and production activity and result in a corresponding decline in demand for the Company's services. Worldwide military, political and economic events, including initiatives by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, may affect both the demand for, and the supply of, oil and gas. Fluctuations during the last few years in the demand and supply of oil and gas have contributed to, and are likely to continue to contribute to, price volatility. Any prolonged reduction in demand for the Company's services could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.   International uncertainties and local laws could adversely affect the Company's business.   International operations are subject to certain political, economic and other uncertainties not encountered in U.S. operations, including increased risks of terrorism, kidnapping of employees, expropriation of equipment as well as expropriation of a particular oil company operator's property and drilling rights, taxation policies, foreign exchange restrictions, currency rate fluctuations and general hazards associated with foreign sovereignty over certain areas in which operations are conducted. There can be no assurance that there will not be changes in local laws, regulations and administrative requirements or the interpretation thereof which could have a material adverse effect on the profitability of the Company's operations or on the ability of the Company to continue operations in certain areas.   Because of the impact of local laws, the Company's future operations in certain areas may be conducted through entities in which local citizens own interests and through entities (including joint ventures) in which the Company holds only a minority interest or pursuant to arrangements under which the Company conducts operations under contract to local entities. While the Company believes that neither operating through such entities nor pursuant to such arrangements would have a material adverse effect on the Company's operations or revenues, there can be no assurance that the Company will in all cases be able to structure or restructure its operations to conform to local law (or the administration thereof) on terms acceptable to the Company.   Venezuela continues to experience significant political, economic and social instability. In the event that extended labor strikes occur or turmoil increases, the Company could experience shortages in labor and/or materials and supplies necessary to operate some or all of its Venezuelan drilling rigs, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.   During the mid-1970s, the Venezuelan government nationalized the exploration and production business. At the present time it appears the Venezuelan government will not nationalize the contract drilling business. Any such nationalization could result in the Company's loss of all or a portion of its assets and business in Venezuela.   Although the Company attempts to minimize the potential impact of such risks by operating in more than one geographical area, during fiscal 2008, approximately 16 percent of the Company's consolidated operating revenues were generated from the international contract drilling business. During fiscal 2008, approximately 95 percent of the international operating revenues were from operations in South America and approximately 71 percent of South American operating revenues were from Venezuela and Ecuador.   The Company's business and results of operations may be adversely affected by foreign currency devaluation.    General    Contracts for work in foreign countries generally provide for payment in United States dollars, except for amounts required to meet local expenses. However, government-owned petroleum companies are more frequently requesting that a greater proportion of these payments be made in local currencies. Based upon current information, the Company believes that exposure to potential losses from currency devaluation is immaterial in Colombia, Equatorial Guinea, Trinidad and Tunisia. In those countries, all receivables and payments are currently in U.S. dollars. Cash balances are kept at an insignificant level which assists in reducing exposure.  8      Table of Contents   Argentina    In 2002, Argentina suffered a 60 percent devaluation of the peso. The Company invoices in (USD) dollars and is paid in pesos equivalent to the dollar invoice. The Company remits the dollars to the parent by exchanging pesos through the Central Bank. The exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Argentine peso has stayed within a narrow range for the past seven years and in fiscal 2008, the Company experienced an immaterial currency loss.   In order to establish a source of local currency to meet current obligations in Argentine pesos, the Company borrowed in the form of an unsecured short-term note from a local bank in Argentina at the market interest rate designated by the bank. The outstanding balance of approximately $1.7 million along with interest was paid in full subsequent to September 30, 2008.    Venezuela    On January 1, 2008, the Venezuelan government changed the official Venezuelan currency from the bolivar to the bolivar fuerte (2150 bolivars equals 2.15 bolivar fuerte).   The Company is exposed to risks of currency devaluation in Venezuela primarily as a result of bolivar fuerte receivable balances and bolivar fuerte cash balances. In Venezuela, approximately 60 percent of the Company's billings are in U.S. dollars and 40 percent in bolivar fuerte. The significance of this arrangement is that even though the dollar-based invoices may be paid in bolivar fuerte, the Company, historically, has usually been able to convert the bolivar fuerte into U.S. dollars in a timely manner and thus avoid, in large measure, devaluation losses pertaining to the dollar-based invoices paid in bolivar fuerte. However, this arrangement is effective only in the absence of exchange controls. In January 2003, the Venezuelan government put into effect exchange controls that fixed the exchange rate and also prohibited the Company, as well as other companies, from converting bolivars into U.S. dollars through the Central Bank.   As part of the exchange controls regulation, the Venezuelan government provided a mechanism by which companies could request conversion of bolivar balances into U.S. dollars. In compliance with such regulations, the Company, in October of 2003, submitted a request to the Venezuelan government seeking permission to dividend earnings, which would convert 14 billion bolivars into U.S. dollars. In January 2004, the Venezuelan government approved the Company's request to convert bolivar cash balances to U.S. dollars and allowed the remittance of $8.8 million U.S. dollars as dividends to the U.S.-based parent. This was the first dividend remitted under the new regulation. On January 16, 2006, a dividend of $6.5 million U.S. dollars was remitted to the U.S.-based parent. On August 18, 2006, the Company applied for a $9.3 million dividend. The Venezuelan government subsequently approved $7.2 million of this dividend and on March 6, 2007, the $7.2 million was paid to the U.S.-based parent. As a consequence, the Company's exposure to currency devaluation was reduced by these amounts.   On July 22, 2008, the Company made applications with the Venezuelan government requesting the approval to convert bolivar fuerte cash balances to U.S. dollars. When and if the Company receives approval from the Venezuelan government, the Company's Venezuelan subsidiary will remit approximately $28.4 million as a dividend to its U.S.-based parent, thus reducing the Company's exposure to currency devaluation.   While the Company has been successful in obtaining government approval for conversion of bolivar fuerte cash balances to U.S. dollars, there is no guarantee that future conversion to U.S. dollars will be permitted. In the event that conversion to U.S. dollars would be prohibited, then bolivar fuerte cash balances would increase and expose the Company to increased risk of devaluation.   As stated above, the Company is exposed to risks of currency devaluation in Venezuela primarily as a result of bolivar fuerte receivable and cash balances. As a result of a 12 percent devaluation of the bolivar during fiscal 2005, the Company experienced total devaluation losses of $0.6 million during that same period.   Past devaluation losses may not be reflective of the actual potential for future devaluation losses. Even though Venezuela continues to operate under the exchange controls in place and the Venezuelan bolivar fuerte exchange rate is fixed at 2.15 bolivar fuerte to one U.S. dollar, the exact amount and timing of devaluation is uncertain. At September 30, 2008, the Company had a $43.4 million cash balance  9      Table of Contents  denominated in bolivar fuerte included in the balance sheet and exposed to the risk of currency devaluation. While the Company is unable to predict future devaluation in Venezuela, if fiscal 2009 balance sheet components are similar to fiscal 2008, and if a 10 percent to 30 percent devaluation were to occur, the Company could experience potential currency devaluation losses ranging from approximately $7 million to $18 million.   The Company derives its revenue in Venezuela from PDVSA, the Venezuelan state-owned petroleum company. At the end of fiscal 2008, the Company had a net receivable from PDVSA of approximately $65.5 million, of which approximately $5.2 million was 90 days old or older. At November 1, 2008, such receivable balance had decreased to approximately $63.9 million, of which approximately $13.5 million was 90 days old or older. The Company continues to communicate with PDVSA regarding the settlement of the outstanding receivables.   The Company's Venezuelan subsidiary has received notification from PDVSA that reimbursement of U.S. dollar invoices previously paid in bolivar fuerte will be made only when supporting documentation has been approved. The approval and subsequent payment would result in reducing the foreign currency exposure by approximately $46.3 million. The Company is unable to determine the timing of when payment will be received.   While the collection of the receivables is difficult and time consuming due to PDVSA policies and procedures, the Company, at this time, has no reason to believe the amounts will not be paid. Historically, PDVSA payments on accounts receivable have, by traditional business measurements, been slower than those of other foreign customers of the Company. However, the failure of PDVSA to make payments on outstanding receivables, or a continued increase in its delay in making payments could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.   Government regulations and environmental laws could adversely affect the Company's business.   Many aspects of the Company's operations are subject to government regulation, including those relating to drilling practices and methods and the level of taxation. In addition, the United States and various other countries have environmental regulations which affect drilling operations. Drilling contractors may be liable for damages resulting from pollution. Under United States regulations, drilling contractors must establish financial responsibility to cover potential liability for pollution of offshore waters. Generally, the Company is indemnified under drilling contracts from liability arising from pollution, except in certain cases of surface pollution. However, the enforceability of indemnification provisions in foreign countries may be questionable.   The Company believes that it is in substantial compliance with all legislation and regulations affecting its operations in the drilling of oil and gas wells and in controlling the discharge of wastes. To date, compliance has not materially affected the capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position of the Company, although these measures may add to the costs of drilling operations. Additional legislation or regulation may reasonably be anticipated, and the effect thereof on operations cannot be predicted.   Variable rate indebtedness subjects the Company to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.   At September 30, 2008, the Company had outstanding, $175 million intermediate-term unsecured debt with staged maturities from August 2009 to August 2014, with varying fixed interest rates for each maturity series. The average interest rate during the next four years on this debt is 6.5 percent, after which it increases to 6.6 percent. The fair value of this debt at September 30, 2008, was approximately $198 million.   The Company has in place a $400 million senior unsecured credit facility which expires in December of 2011. The Company had $325 million borrowed and three letters of credit totaling $25.9 million outstanding against the facility at September 30, 2008. As of November 20, 2008, borrowings under the facility had declined to $290 million. The interest rate on the borrowings is based on a spread over LIBOR and the Company pays a commitment fee based on the unused balance of the facility. The spread over LIBOR as well as the commitment fee is determined according to a scale based on a ratio of the Company's total debt to total capitalization. The Company also has the option to borrow at the prime rate for maturities of less than 30 days.  10      Table of Contents  At November 26, 2008, the Company was in discussions with the syndicate leader of the current bank facility about securing another separate bank facility for $100 to $150 million. While there is no certainty that such a facility could be placed, the Company expects that one could be completed and funded by late December 2008 or January 2009. Should the Company be unable to secure additional financing, there is a risk that it would be forced to liquidate a portion of its investment portfolio at depressed market prices in order to fund its capital expenditures planned for 2009.   The Company also has an agreement with a single bank for an unsecured line of credit for $5 million. The interest rate on borrowings is equal to the prime rate minus 1.75%. At September 30, 2008, the Company had no outstanding borrowings against the credit line.   Interest rates could rise for various reasons in the future and increase the Company's total interest expense, depending upon the amount borrowed against the credit lines.   The Company's securities portfolio may lose significant value due to a decline in equity prices and other market-related risks, thus impacting the Company's debt ratio and financial strength.   At September 30, 2008, the Company had a portfolio of securities with a total market value of $384 million. These securities are subject to a wide variety of market-related risks that could substantially reduce or increase the market value of the Company's holdings. Except for the Company's holdings in Atwood Oceanics, Inc. and investments in limited partnerships carried at cost, the portfolio is recorded at fair value on its balance sheet with changes in unrealized after-tax value reflected in the equity section of its balance sheet. Any reduction in market value would have an impact on the Company's debt ratio and financial strength. At November 20, 2008, the market value of the portfolio had dropped to approximately $175 million.   The loss of one or a number of our large customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.   In fiscal 2008, the Company received approximately 59 percent of its consolidated operating revenues from the Company's ten largest contract drilling customers and approximately 27 percent of its consolidated operating revenues from the Company's three largest customers (including their affiliates). The Company believes that its relationship with all of these customers is good; however, the loss of one or more of its larger customers would have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.   Competition for experienced technical personnel may negatively impact our operations or financial results.   The Company utilizes highly skilled personnel in operating and supporting its businesses. In times of high utilization, it can be difficult to find qualified individuals. Although to date the Company's operations have not been materially affected by competition for personnel, an inability to obtain a sufficient number of qualified personnel could materially impact the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.   New technologies may cause the Company's drilling methods and equipment to become less competitive, resulting in an adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and results of operations.   Although the Company takes measures to ensure that it uses advanced oil and natural gas drilling technology, changes in technology or improvements in competitors' equipment could make the Company's equipment less competitive or require significant capital investments to keep its equipment competitive.  11                 Table of Contents       Item 1B.
