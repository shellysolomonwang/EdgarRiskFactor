PART I  Item 1. Business  General  Marathon Oil Corporation was incorporated in 2001 and is an international energy company engaged in exploration and production, oil sands mining and integrated gas with operations in the United States, Angola, Canada, Equatorial Guinea, Indonesia, the Iraqi Kurdistan Region, Libya, Norway, Poland and the United Kingdom. We are based in Houston, Texas with our corporate headquarters at 5555 San Felipe Road, Houston, Texas 77056-2723 and a telephone number of (713) 629-6600.    3    Table of Contents On June 30, 2011, the spin-off of Marathon’s downstream business was completed, creating two independent energy companies: Marathon Oil and MPC. Marathon shareholders at the close of business on the record date of June 27, 2011 received one share of MPC common stock for every two shares of Marathon common stock held. Fractional shares of MPC common stock were not distributed and any fractional share of MPC common stock otherwise issuable to a Marathon shareholder was sold in the open market on such shareholder’s behalf, and such shareholder received a cash payment with respect to that fractional share. A private letter ruling received in June 2011 from the IRS affirmed the tax-free nature of the spin-off. Activities related to the downstream business have been treated as discontinued operations in all periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, with additional information in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements.  Strategy and Results Summary  Assets within our three segments are at various stages in their lifecycle: base, growth or exploration. We have a stable group of base assets, which include our OSM and IG segments and E&P assets in Norway, Equatorial Guinea, Libya, the U.K. and the U.S. These assets generate much of the cash that will be available for investment in our growth assets and exploration projects. Growth assets are where we expect to make significant investment in order to realize oil and gas production and reserve increases. We are focused on U.S. liquid hydrocarbon growth by developing liquids-rich shale play positions, including most recently the establishment of a strong position in the core of the Eagle Ford shale play. In addition to the U.S. shale plays, growth assets include the development of Angola Block 31, our discoveries in the Iraqi Kurdistan Region, select Gulf of Mexico blocks and our Canadian in-situ assets. Our areas of exploration are Poland, the Iraqi Kurdistan Region, Norway and the Gulf of Mexico. We continually evaluate ways to optimize our portfolio through acquisitions and divestitures, with a previously stated goal of divesting between $1.5 and $3.0 billion of non-core assets between 2011 and 2013. Through January 2012, we closed such transaction having values of $640 million.  We ended 2011 with proved reserves of 1.8 bboe, an 10 percent increase over 2010. Average sales volumes were 219 mbbld of liquid hydrocarbon, 866 mmcfd of natural gas and 43 mbbld of synthetic crude oil, with 66 percent of our liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes from international operations, for which average realizations have exceeded WTI prices. We invested in the development of assets in all our segments, totaling $3.4 billion in capital expenditures related to continuing operations for the year, with $3 billion related to our E&P segment. We expect continued capital expenditures, primarily funded with cash flow from operations, in exploration and development activities in order to realize continued reserve and sales growth. See Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Outlook, for discussion of our $4.8 billion capital spending budget for 2012.  The above discussion of strategy and results includes forward-looking statements with respect to the goal of divesting between $1.5 and $3.0 billion of non-core assets between 2011 and 2013 and expected investment in exploration and development activities. Some factors that could potentially affect the divestiture of non-core assets and expected investment in exploration and development activities include changes in prices of and demand for liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas, actions of competitors, occurrence of acquisitions or dispositions of oil and natural gas properties, future financial condition and operating results, and economic, and/or regulatory factors affecting our businesses, the identification of buyers and the negotiation of acceptable prices and other terms, as well as other customary closing conditions. The foregoing factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.    4    Table of Contents The map below illustrates the locations of our worldwide operations.       Segment and Geographic Information  For operating segment and geographic financial information, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.  Exploration and Production Segment  In the discussion that follows regarding our exploration and production operations, references to net wells, sales or investment indicate our ownership interest or share, as the context requires.  We are engaged in oil and gas exploration, development and/or production activities in the United States, Angola, Canada, Equatorial Guinea, Indonesia, the Iraqi Kurdistan Region, Libya, Norway, Poland, and the United Kingdom.  Liquids-Rich Shale Plays  Eagle Ford – In the fourth quarter of 2011, we closed several acquisitions in the Eagle Ford shale play of south Texas for a total cash consideration of $4.5 billion. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about these acquisitions.  Upon finalization of the 2011 Eagle Ford acquisition transactions, we will have just over 300,000 net acres in the Eagle Ford shale with an average working interest of approximately 80 percent. As of December 31, 2011, we had 14 operated drilling rigs active in the play, with plans to increase to 18 drilling rigs and 4 dedicated hydraulic fracturing crews by the end of 2012. Our plans include drilling and completing 200 – 230 gross (160 – 185 net) operated wells in 2012.  Including the impact of our fourth quarter 2011 acquisitions, annual net sales for 2011 were 2 mboed, with a December exit rate of 13 mboed. Our production from the Eagle Ford shale is either sold at the lease or moved via truck or pipeline to markets. We own and operate the Sugarloaf gathering system, a 42-mile natural gas pipeline through the heart of our recently purchased acreage in Karnes, Atascosa, and Bee Counties of south Texas. Our future production estimates will require additional markets, transportation, storage and plant processing to be either contracted or constructed and a variety of negotiations are underway with a goal of continued access to adequate infrastructure and markets. Key considerations in this development will be the timing of contract availability and efforts to receive optimal price based upon delivery location.    5    Table of Contents Bakken – We hold just over 400,000 net acres in the Bakken shale oil play in the Williston Basin of North Dakota and eastern Montana with an average working interest in the acreage of approximately 80 percent. Throughout 2011, we continued selective acreage acquisitions and leasing, adding approximately 40,000 net acres which expanded to a new prospect area. In 2011 we drilled 61 gross (55 net) operated wells and completed 71 gross (63 net) operated wells. We also moved from 20-stage to 30-stage hydraulic fracturing, which increases both production rates and estimated ultimate recovery from the wells. At December 31, 2011, we had 7 operated drilling rigs and 2 dedicated hydraulic fracturing crews in our Bakken shale program, and expect to add one more rig in 2012 to accomplish plans to drill 69 gross (53 net) and complete 72 – 84 gross (53 – 61 net) operated wells in 2012.  Our net sales from the Bakken shale averaged 17 mboed in 2011, a 36 percent increase over 2010, and our production exit rate for 2011 was 24 mboed. We sell our Bakken production into local markets predominately via trucking. A variety of negotiations are underway to provide adequate infrastructure and markets for our future estimated production levels, including the potential export of volumes from the regional markets via pipeline or rail projects.  Anadarko Woodford – In the Anadarko Woodford shale play in Oklahoma, we hold 160,000 net acres of which approximately 100,000 acres are held by production. In 2011, we executed an operated drilling program focused on the liquids-rich areas of the play, drilling 15 gross (11 net) exploration and 8 gross (6 net) development wells, of which 11 gross (9 net) wells were completed. The Shi Randall well, in which we hold a 50 percent working interest, was completed in the third quarter of 2011. The Shi Randall had a gross IP of 455 bbld of liquid hydrocarbons and 6 mmcfd of natural gas, subject to pipeline constraints. It was one of the initial wells in the Knox area (southern Woodford) and is helping to prove up a prospective area where we have a strong acreage position.  The Anadarko Woodford shale averaged net sales of 2 mboed during 2011. In 2012, we plan to maintain our current level of 6 rigs and drill 35 – 40 gross (19 – 22 net) operated wells with more focus on development drilling. Outside-operated projects could add an additional 30 – 50 gross (6 – 10 net) wells. See below for additional discussion of our conventional, primarily natural gas production operations in Oklahoma.  DJ Basin – In 2010, we began leasing in the Niobrara play in the DJ Basin of northern Colorado and southeast Wyoming and built an acreage position of approximately 180,000 acres. In April 2011, we farmed-out a 30 percent undivided working interest retaining 70 percent and operatorship. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding this transaction. As of December 31, 2011 we hold 151,000 net acres. In 2011, we drilled a total of 12 gross (7 net) operated wells, with four gross (two net) operated wells completed. We are currently operating 2 drilling rigs in the DJ Basin and expect to drill 25 – 35 gross (13 – 19 net) operated wells in 2012. Outside-operated projects could add an additional 25 – 35 gross (4 – 5 net) wells. We exited December with a net production rate of 86 boed. We have other natural gas assets in Colorado which are discussed below.  United States  Alaska – We produce natural gas in the Cook Inlet and adjacent Kenai Peninsula of Alaska where we have operated and outside-operated interests in 10 fields covering 118,000 net acres. In 2011, we drilled 1 operated well in the Ninilchik field and participated in 1 non-operated horizontal well in the McArthur River field, both in the Cook Inlet. Plans for 2012 include continued investments in production optimization and operational reliability.  Net natural gas sales from Alaska averaged 94 mmcfd in 2011. Typically, our natural gas sales from Alaska are seasonal in nature, trending down during the second and third quarters of each year and increasing during the fourth and first quarters. To manage supplies to meet contractual demand we produce and store natural gas in a partially depleted reservoir in the Kenai natural gas field.  Complementing our production operations in Alaska is our majority ownership in four operated natural gas pipelines totaling 140 miles. These are bidirectional systems providing transportation from multiple producers to numerous end users in and around the Cook Inlet.  Colorado – We hold leases of 8,700 net acres with natural gas production in the Piceance Basin of Colorado, located in the Greater Grand Valley field complex, with net sales of 20 mmcfd in 2011. Currently the field has 77 gross/net wells producing.  Oklahoma – We have long-established operated and non-operated conventional production operations in several Oklahoma fields from which 2011 sales averaged 2 mbbld of liquid hydrocarbons and 53 mmcfd of natural gas. In 2011 we participated in 7 gross (2 net), non-operated wells in the state. We also drilled 1 company operated well. Plans for 2012 include 11 gross (2 net) wells, targeting liquids.    6    Table of Contents Texas/North Louisiana/New Mexico – In east Texas and north Louisiana, we hold 184,000 net acres. Approximately 20,000 of the acres are in the Haynesville and Bossier natural gas shale plays. Most of the acreage in these shale plays is held by production. We participated in 3 gross (1 net) non-operated wells in the area during 2011. Conventional production was primarily from the Mimms Creek, Pearwood and Oletha fields, in 2011. Net sales from east Texas and north Louisiana averaged 7 mboed.  We also participate in several outside-operated Permian Basin fields in west Texas and New Mexico. Net sales from this area were 7 mboed in 2011. Activity in 2012 will center around carbon dioxide flood programs in the Seminole and Vacuum fields.  Wyoming – We hold 260,000 net acres in Wyoming and have almost 100 years of exploration and development in the state. We have ongoing enhanced oil recovery projects at the mature Bighorn Basin and Wind River Basin fields and initiated an additional enhanced recovery project at our 100 percent owned and operated Pitchfork field in 2011. We have conventional natural gas operations in the Greater Green River Basin and unconventional coal bed natural gas operations in the Powder River Basin. In 2011, we drilled 17 gross (17 net) operated development wells in Wyoming, which included five wellbore re-entries and plan 3 – 4 gross (3 – 4 net) operated wells in 2012. Our Wyoming sales averaged 17 mbbld of liquid hydrocarbons and 75 mmcfd of natural gas during 2011. In addition, we own and operate the 420-mile Red Butte Pipeline. This crude oil pipeline connects Silvertip Station on the Montana/Wyoming state line to Casper, Wyoming.  West Virginia/Pennsylvania – In the Appalachian Basin we hold 82,000 net acres in the Marcellus shale natural gas play in Pennsylvania and West Virginia. In February 2011, we entered into a joint venture on a large portion of our Marcellus shale acreage position. Under the agreement which ends in 2012, our joint venture partner will earn 50 percent of approximately 60,000 acres under a drilling carry and has an option to acquire our remaining acreage while we retain the rights to continue to market the acreage to others. In 2011, 2 gross (1 net) outside-operated wells were drilled with 1 gross (0.5 net) well awaiting completion. We expect to participate in 4 gross (2 net) wells in 2012.  Gulf of Mexico – Production   On December 31, 2011, we held material interests in seven producing fields, four of which are company-operated.  We operate and have a 65 percent working interest in the Ewing Bank Block 873 platform which is located 130 miles south of New Orleans, Louisiana. The platform started operations in 1994 and serves as a production hub for the Lobster, Oyster and Arnold fields on Ewing Bank blocks 873, 917 and 963. The facility also processes third-party production via subsea tie-backs.  We own a 50 percent working interest in the outside-operated Petronius field on Viosca Knoll Blocks 786 and 830 located 130 miles southeast of New Orleans, which includes six producing wells. The Petronius platform is capable of providing processing and transportation services to nearby third-party fields. During 2012, we plan to acquire seismic data in order to identify future drilling opportunities.  We hold a 30 percent working interest in the outside-operated Neptune field located on Atwater Valley Block 575, 120 miles off the coast of Louisiana. The development includes seven subsea wells tied back to a stand-alone platform. Additional drilling and recompletion activity is being considered for 2012.  We have a 100 percent operated working interest and an 81 percent net revenue interest in the Droshky development located on Green Canyon Block 244 off the coast of Louisiana. This development began production in mid-July of 2010 and reached peak net production of 45 mboed in the third quarter of 2010. The field will be produced to abandonment pressures which are expected to be reached in the first half of 2012.  We hold a 68 percent working interest in Ozona. Development of our operated Ozona prospect, located on Garden Banks Block 515, was delayed by the Drilling Moratorium (discussed below) and subsequent regulatory changes. In 2011, we completed the Ozona well as a single zone producer tied back to a non-operated host platform. First production began in late December 2011.  Average net sales for 2011 from the Gulf of Mexico were 30 mbbld of liquid hydrocarbons and 24 mmcfd of natural gas.  We also own a 34 percent outside-operated interest in the Neptune gas plant located onshore Louisiana. This high efficiency gas plant, which services four high pressure offshore and onshore pipelines, has a 650 mmcfd capacity.  Gulf of Mexico – Exploration  We have 21 prospects, 16 of which are operated in the Gulf of Mexico. As a result of an explosion and significant spill from a deepwater rig in the Gulf of Mexico, the U.S. Department of the Interior issued a drilling moratorium on May 30, 2010 (“Drilling Moratorium”), to suspend the drilling of deepwater wells, and prohibit drilling any new deepwater wells    7    Table of Contents  (defined as greater than 500 foot water depth). The Drilling Moratorium was lifted on October 12, 2010. Our first exploration plan approval was received in August 2011. In 2011, we received lease extensions for 26 blocks in the Gulf of Mexico which had been impacted by the Drilling Moratorium.  A successful deepwater oil discovery well was drilled on the Gunflint prospect located on Mississippi Canyon Block 948, 160 miles southeast of New Orleans in 2008. We own a 15.25 percent interest in this outside-operated prospect. Gunflint prospect appraisal wells were subject to the Drilling Moratorium. Drilling of the first appraisal well began in December 2011, and a second appraisal well is planned for mid-year 2012.  In the first quarter of 2009, we participated in a deepwater oil discovery on the Shenandoah prospect located on Walker Ridge Block 52. We own a 10 percent interest in this outside-operated prospect. The first appraisal well is planned for mid-year 2012.  In March 2011, we completed our evaluation of the Flying Dutchman exploratory well, located on Green Canyon Block 511. We determined that the options to develop were not viable and all well costs have been expensed.  In accordance with the federal government’s Drilling Moratorium, we temporarily suspended drilling an exploratory well on the Innsbruck prospect located on Mississippi Canyon Block 993 at a depth of 19,800 feet as compared to a proposed total depth of 29,500 feet. In 2011, we received approval for our current exploration plan from the BOEMRE. We have contracted a rig for this project and drilling is expected to commence in the third quarter of 2012. In December 2011, we assigned a 40 percent interest in the portion of Mississippi Canyon Block 993 that includes Innsbruck, in exchange for a 30 percent non-operated interest in Green Canyon Blocks 403 and 404 in the Kilchurn prospect plus reimbursement of certain well costs incurred to date on Innsbruck. We now have a 45 percent working interest in Innsbruck and continue to operate the prospect. The operator commenced drilling on the Kilchurn prospect in December 2011.  In October 2011, we received approval of an exploration plan from the BOEMRE for the Key Largo prospect located on Walker Ridge Block 578. We have a 60 percent working interest and are the operator of this prospect. Drilling is expected in the second half of 2012.  Africa  Equatorial Guinea – We own a 63 percent operated working interest under a PSC in the Alba field which is offshore EG. During 2011, EG net liquid hydrocarbon sales averaged 38 mbbld, and net natural gas sales were 443 mmcfd. Planned maintenance in EG is scheduled for a 28-day period from late first quarter through early second quarter 2012, with operations expected to be completely shut down for eight of those days.  We hold a 63 percent operated working interest in the Deep Luba discovery on the Alba Block and we are the operator with a 90 percent interest in the Corona well on Block D. These wells are part of our long-term LNG strategy. We expect these discoveries to be developed when the natural gas supply from the nearby Alba field starts to decline.  We also own a 52 percent interest in Alba Plant LLC, an equity method investee that operates an onshore LPG processing plant located on Bioko Island. Alba field natural gas is processed by the LPG plant. Under a long-term contract at a fixed price per btu, the LPG plant extracts secondary condensate and LPG from the natural gas stream and uses the natural gas in its operations. During 2011, a gross 890 mmcfd of natural gas was supplied to the LPG production facility and 4 mbbld of secondary condensate and 11 mbbld of LPG were produced by Alba Plant LLC. Our share of the income ultimately generated by the subsequent export of secondary condensate and LPG produced by Alba Plant LLC is reflected in our E&P segment.  As part of our Integrated Gas segment, we own 45 percent of AMPCO and 60 percent of EGHoldings, both of which are accounted for as equity method investments. AMPCO operates a methanol plant and EGHoldings operates an LNG production facility, both located on Bioko Island. Dry natural gas from the Alba field, which remains after the condensate and LPG are removed by Alba Plant LLC, is supplied to both of these facilities under long-term contracts at fixed prices. Because of the location of and limited local demand for natural gas in Equatorial Guinea, we consider the prices under the contracts with Alba Plant LLC, AMPCO and EGHoldings to be comparable to the price that could be realized from transactions with unrelated parties in this market under the same or similar circumstances. Our share of the income ultimately generated by the subsequent export of methanol produced by AMPCO and LNG produced by EGHoldings is reflected in our Integrated Gas segment as discussed below. During 2011, a gross 127 mmcfd of dry natural gas was supplied to the methanol plant and a gross 668 mmcfd of dry gas was supplied to the LNG production facility. Any remaining dry gas is returned offshore and reinjected into the Alba field for later production.  Libya – Civil unrest, which began in February 2011 in parts of North Africa, escalated to armed conflict in Libya where we hold a 16 percent working interest in the Waha concessions, which encompass almost 13 million acres located in the Sirte Basin of eastern Libya. During the first quarter 2011, all production operations in Libya were suspended. In the    8    Table of Contents  fourth quarter of 2011, limited production resumed from the Waha concessions, but we made no deliveries of hydrocarbons. In January 2012, Libya produced 190 gross mbbld (25 net mbbld), and sales are planned to resume in the first quarter of 2012. The return of our operations in Libya to pre-conflict levels is unknown at this time; however, we and our partners in the Waha concessions are assessing the condition of our assets and determining when the full resumption of operations will be viable.  Angola – Offshore Angola, we hold 10 percent working interests in Blocks 31 and 32, both of which are outside-operated. The discoveries on Blocks 31 and 32 represent several potential development hubs. In 2008, we received approval to proceed with the first deepwater development project, called the PSVM development, which includes the Plutao, Saturno, Venus and Marte discoveries and one successful appraisal well in the northeastern portion of Block 31. The PSVM development will utilize an FPSO with a total of 48 production and injection wells. Development drilling began in 2010 and first production is anticipated in mid-2012. The potential for a second development hub on this block is being evaluated. Studies are underway to establish a development in the eastern part of Block 32 and to assess the development potential of the other discoveries. We anticipate at least one development on Block 32.  Europe  Norway – We operate 10 licenses and hold interests in over 249,000 net acres on the offshore Norwegian continental shelf. In 2011, net sales from Norway averaged 80 mbbld of liquid hydrocarbons and 42 mmcfd of gas.  The Alvheim development is comprised of the Kameleon, East Kameleon and Kneler fields, in which we have a 65 percent working interest, and the Boa field, in which we have a 58 percent working interest. It is produced to the Alvheim complex which consists of an FPSO with subsea infrastructure. In 2011, due to debottlenecking efforts, capacity of the FPSO increased to 86 mbbld net (149 mbbld gross). Produced oil is transported by shuttle tanker and produced natural gas is transported to the SAGE system by pipeline. At the end of 2011, the Alvheim development included 13 producing wells and two water disposal wells. An additional development well is planned in 2012.  The nearby outside-operated Vilje field, in which we own a 47 percent working interest, began producing through the Alvheim complex in August 2008. At the end of 2011, two wells were producing and an additional development, Vilje Sor had been approved. Production from Vilje Sor is estimated to begin near the end of 2013.  The Volund field, five miles south of the Alvheim FPSO was the second subsea development tied back to the Alvheim complex. The Volund development, in which we own a 65 percent operated working interest, consists of three production wells and one water injection well. First production from Volund was announced in September 2009. It initially functioned as a swing producer to allow us to maintain full capacity on the Alvheim FPSO until the second quarter of 2010 when we commenced full production. Drilling of an additional development well at Volund is planned for fourth quarter 2012, with first production scheduled in early 2013.  Also offshore Norway, are the Boyla (formerly Marihone) and Viper discoveries in which we hold a 65 percent operated working interest. The Boyla oil discovery is located in license PL340 about 12 miles south of the Volund and Alvheim fields. The Viper oil discovery is located in license PL203, immediately next to the Volund field in license PL150. Both discoveries are being evaluated for possible tie back to the Alvheim complex. An investment decision on Boyla could occur in the second quarter of 2012, with first production estimated to begin in the fourth quarter of 2014.  Exploration activities will continue in 2012 and 2013. The Velsemøy well is expected to begin drilling late in 2012 in license PL531 where we hold a 10 percent carried working interest. Drilling is expected to commence in the first quarter of 2013 on the Sverdrup well in license PL 330 where we hold a 30 percent operated working interest.  United Kingdom – Net sales from the U.K. averaged 21 mbbld of liquid hydrocarbons and 55 mmcfd of natural gas. Our largest asset in the U.K. sector of the North Sea is the Brae area complex where we are the operator and have a 42 percent working interest in the South, Central, North and West Brae fields and a 39 percent working interest in the East Brae field. The Brae Alpha platform and facilities host the South, Central and West Brae fields. The North Brae field, which is produced via the Brae Bravo platform, and the East Brae field, which is produced via the East Brae platform, are natural gas condensate fields. The East Brae platform also hosts the nearby Braemar field in which we have a 28 percent working interest. Two development wells were completed at West Brae in early 2011 and we continue to pursue Brae complex projects designed to maximize natural gas recovery and maintain deliverability rates to the U.K. market.  The strategic location of the Brae platforms, along with pipeline and onshore infrastructure, has generated third-party processing and transportation business since 1986. Currently, the operators of twenty-five third-party fields are contracted to use the Brae system and 73 mboed are being processed or transported through the Brae infrastructure. In 2011, we installed a new module to accommodate the tie back of the third-party operated Devenick field. In addition to generating processing and pipeline tariff revenue, this third-party business optimizes infrastructure usage.    9    Table of Contents The Brae group owns a 50 percent interest in the outside-operated SAGE system. The SAGE pipeline transports natural gas from the Brae area, and the third-party Beryl area, and has a total wet natural gas capacity of 1.1 bcf per day. The SAGE terminal at St. Fergus in northeast Scotland processes natural gas from the SAGE pipeline as well as approximately 1 bcf per day of third-party natural gas.  In the U.K. Atlantic Margin west of the Shetland Islands, we own an average 30 percent working interest in the outside-operated Foinaven area complex, consisting of a 28 percent working interest in the main Foinaven field, 47 percent working interest in East Foinaven and 20 percent working interest in the T35 and T25 fields. The export of Foinaven liquid hydrocarbons is via shuttle tanker from the FPSO to market. All natural gas sales are to the non-operated Magnus platform for use as injection gas. An upgrade of equipment on the FPSO is expected to extend the life of the fields through 2021. Additionally, the planned installation of replacement flowlines should secure the long-term integrity of the subsea infrastructure, but the related downtime is expected to cause a reduction in sales volumes in 2012. Average net sales from Foinaven were 12 mboed in 2011.  Poland – Between December 2009 and October 2010, we acquired eleven 5-year licenses, totaling 2.3 million gross acres. In 2011, we farmed-out to two companies an aggregate 49 percent undivided interest in ten of these licenses which will be earned through drilling. As of December 31, 2011, we hold a 51 percent working interest in these 10 concessions, a 100 percent interest in the remaining concession for a total of 1.2 million net acres. We are operator under all licenses. We are in the early stages of exploring and evaluating the full potential of these holdings. We drilled, cored and logged our first vertical exploratory well in late 2011 and are evaluating the data. In addition, we expect to complete proprietary 2-D seismic acquisitions in the first quarter of 2012. We have a drilling commitment of one well per license and plan to drill 6 – 7 gross (3 – 4 net) exploration wells in 2012.  Canada  We hold interests in both operated and outside-operated exploration stage oil sand leases in Alberta, Canada, which would be developed using in-situ methods of extraction. These leases cover approximately 143,000 gross acres (52,000 net) in four project areas: Namur, in which we hold a 60 percent operated interest; Birchwood, in which we hold a 100 percent operated interest; Ells River, in which we hold a 20 percent outside-operated interest and Saleski in which we hold a 33 percent outside-operated interest. Exploration on the Birchwood prospect continued in the winter of 2011-2012 with a seismic program and water well drilling. Approximately 100 stratigraphic test wells were drilled on the Birchwood prospect in the winter of 2010-2011 providing data for the ongoing assessment of reservoir quality. We expect sanction of a pilot project in 2013.  Other International  Iraqi Kurdistan Region – In October 2010, we acquired a position in four exploration blocks in the Iraqi Kurdistan Region. In aggregate, these contracts provide us with access to approximately 368,000 net acres. We signed PSCs for operatorship and 80 percent ownership in the Harir and Safen blocks northeast of Erbil. The KRG holds a 20 percent carried interest in these blocks. We have committed to a seismic program and to drilling one well on both Hafir and Safen during the initial three-year exploration period. We were assigned interests in two additional outside-operated blocks located north-northwest of Erbil: Atrush, in which we have a 16 percent ownership (the KRG holds a 4 percent carried interest), and Sarsang, in which we have a 20 percent interest (the KRG holds a 5 percent carried interest). In 2011, we announced the Atrush-1 discovery on the Atrush block and a second discovery, the Swara Tika-1 well on the Sarsang block. The Swara Tika-2, an appraisal well on the Sarsang block, commenced drilling in the fourth quarter of 2011. The Atrush-2, an appraisal well on the Atrush block, is planned for 2012. Planning is underway on extended well testing and early production systems, with first production expected in the fourth quarter of 2012.  Indonesia – We are the operator of three exploration licenses in Indonesia: the Pasangkayu block with a 70 percent interest, the Kumawa block with a 55 percent interest, and the Bone Bay block with a 55 percent interest. In 2011 and 2010, wells were drilled on the Bravo and Romeo prospects in the Pasangkayu block. These wells were expensed as dry holes. We have notified our joint venture partner and the Indonesian government that we intend to relinquish the PSC on the Pasangkayu block. Discussions continue and we are awaiting a government response. We are evaluating the Bone Bay and Kumawa blocks.  Acquisitions and Dispositions  As previously discussed, during 2011 we closed several acquisition transactions in the Eagle Ford shale play and farmed-out minority interests in our DJ Basin and Poland acreage. Also, in March 2011, we closed the sale of our outside-operated interests in the Gudrun field development and the Brynhild and Eirin exploration areas offshore Norway.  In October 2011, we entered into definitive agreements to sell our equity method interests in Poseidon Oil Pipeline Company, L.L.C. and Odyssey Pipeline L.L.C. and certain other oil pipeline interests including the Eugene Island Pipeline System. The transaction closed on January 3, 2012.    10    Table of Contents In December 2011 we sold our 25 percent interest in the Stones prospect located on Walker Ridge Block 508 to the operator. We also exchanged a 100 percent interest in Atwater Valley Block 398 in the Sandpiper prospect, for a 100 percent interest in Walker Ridge Block 577 in the Key Largo prospect and a 20 percent interest in Green Canyon Block 286 in the Hypnos prospect. After this transaction, we hold a 50 percent interest in Green Canyon Block 286 and a 100 percent interest in Walker Ridge Block 577.  See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about the acquisitions and Note 6 for additional information about the farm-outs and divestitures.  The above discussion of the E&P segment includes forward-looking statements with respect to anticipated future exploratory and development drilling activity, drilling rig activity in the U.S., planned maintenance downtime, timing of reaching abandonment pressures in Droshky, continued investments in Alaska, timing of first production from Vilje Sor, Boyla and Kurdistan, planned acquisition of seismic data for Petronius, plans to achieve first production from the PSVM development on Block 31 offshore Angola and other possible developments, plans to resume sales in Libya and the expected extension of the Foinaven fields. Some factors which could possibly affect these forward-looking statements include pricing, supply and demand for petroleum products, the amount of capital available for exploration and development, regulatory constraints, drilling rig availability, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorist acts and the governmental or military response, and other geological, operating and economic considerations. The foregoing forward-looking statements may be further affected by the inability to obtain or delay in obtaining necessary government and third-party approvals and permits. The offshore developments could further be affected by presently known data concerning size and character of reservoirs, economic recoverability, future drilling success and production experience. Predicted planned maintenance and FPSO downtime are good faith estimates and preliminary, and therefore, subject to change. The foregoing factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.  Productive and Drilling Wells  For our E&P segment, the following tables set forth gross and net productive wells and service wells as of December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 and drilling wells as of December 31, 2011.

Information on wells with multiple completions operated by others is unavailable to us.      (b)   As operations were resuming in Libya at December 31, 2011, an accurate count of productive wells was not possible; therefore no Libyan wells are included in this number. Production from Libya at December 31, 2011 was approximately 30 percent of the 45 mboed pre-conflict level.    11    Table of Contents Drilling Activity  For our E&P segment, the following table sets forth, by geographic area, the number of net productive and dry development and exploratory wells completed in each of the last three years.

Acreage  We believe we have satisfactory title to our properties in accordance with standards generally accepted in the industry; nevertheless, we can be involved in title disputes from time to time which may result in litigation. In the case of undeveloped properties, an investigation of record title is made at the time of acquisition. Drilling title opinions are usually prepared before commencement of drilling operations. Our title to properties may be subject to burdens such as royalty, overriding royalty, carried, net profits, working and other similar interests and contractual arrangements customary in the industry. In addition, our interests may be subject to obligations or duties under applicable laws or burdens such as net profits interests, liens related to operating agreements, development obligations or capital commitments under international PSCs or exploration licenses.  The following table sets forth, by geographic area, the gross and net developed and undeveloped exploration and production acreage held in our E&P segment as of December 31, 2011.

These activities include the transportation of production to market centers, the sale of commodities to third parties and storage of production. We balance our various sales, storage and transportation positions through what we call supply optimization, which can include the purchase of commodities from third parties for resale. Supply optimization serves to aggregate volumes in order to satisfy transportation commitments thereby optimizing transportation capacity and value and to achieve flexibility within product types and delivery points.  Oil Sands Mining Segment  We hold a 20 percent outside-operated interest in the AOSP, an oil sands mining joint venture located in Alberta, Canada. The joint venture produces bitumen from oil sands deposits in the Athabasca region utilizing mining techniques and upgrades the bitumen to synthetic crude oils. The AOSP’s mining and extraction assets are located near Fort McMurray, Alberta and include the Muskeg River and the Jackpine mines. Gross design capacity of the combined mines is 255,000 (51,000 net to our interest) barrels of bitumen per day. As of December 31, 2011, we own or have rights to participate in developed and undeveloped leases totaling approximately 216,000 gross (43,000 net) acres. The underlying developed leases are held for the duration of the project, with royalties payable to the province of Alberta. The upgrading assets are located at Fort Saskatchewan, northeast of Edmonton, Alberta.  The five year AOSP Expansion 1 was completed in 2011. The Jackpine mine commenced production under a phased start-up in the third quarter of 2010 and began supplying oil sands ore to the base processing facility in the fourth quarter of 2010. The upgrader expansion was completed and commenced operations in the second quarter of 2011. Synthetic crude oil sales volumes for 2011 were 43 mbbld, with production of 38 mbbld. Phase one of debottlenecking opportunities was approved in 2011 and potential future expansions and additional debottlenecking opportunities remain under review.  Current AOSP operations use established processes to mine oil sands deposits from an open-pit mine, extract the bitumen and upgrade it into synthetic crude oils. Ore is mined using traditional truck and shovel mining techniques. The mined ore passes through primary crushers to reduce the ore chunks in size and is then sent to rotary breakers where the ore chunks are further reduced to smaller particles. The particles are combined with hot water to create slurry. The slurry moves through the extraction process where it separates into sand, clay and bitumen-rich froth. A solvent is added to the bitumen froth to separate out the remaining solids, water and heavy asphaltenes. The solvent washes the sand and produces clean bitumen that is required for the upgrader to run efficiently. The process yields a mixture of solvent and bitumen which is then transported from the mine to the Scotford upgrader via the approximately 300 mile Corridor Pipeline.  The bitumen is upgraded at Scotford using both hydrotreating and hydroconversion processes to remove sulfur and break the heavy bitumen molecules into lighter products. Blendstocks acquired from outside sources are utilized in the production of our saleable products. The upgrader produces synthetic crude oil and vacuum gas oil. The vacuum gas oil is sold to an affiliate of the operator under a long term contract at market-related prices, and the other products are sold in the marketplace.  As announced in the second quarter of 2011, the governments of Alberta and Canada have agreed to partially fund Quest CCS for 865 million Canadian dollars. Financing would be received over a period of 15 years, including development, construction and 10 years of operations. However, the funding is subject to conditions of achieving certain performance objectives. We expect a final investment decision on this project in 2012.  The above discussions include forward-looking statements with respect to Quest CCS. Some factors that could potentially affect these forward-looking statements include projected costs and satisfaction of remaining conditions necessary for final investment decision. The foregoing factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.    13    Table of Contents Reserves  Estimated Reserve Quantities  The following table sets forth estimated quantities of our net proved liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserves based upon an unweighted average of closing prices for the first day of each month in the 12-month periods ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009. Approximately 65 percent of our proved reserves are located in Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (“OECD”) countries.  Reserves are disclosed by continent, by country, if the proved reserves related to any geographic area, on an oil-equivalent barrel basis represent 15 percent or more of our total proved reserves.

Also, synthetic crude oil reserves increased, primarily because of the inclusion of additional lease portions in the Jackpine mine and technical and economic reevaluations at year end.  The above estimated quantities of net proved liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves are forward-looking statements and are based on a number of assumptions, including (among others) commodity prices, presently known physical data concerning size and character of the reservoirs, economic recoverability, technology developments, future drilling success, industry economic conditions, levels of cash flow from operations, production experience and other operating considerations. The above estimated quantities of synthetic crude oil reserves are forward-looking statements and are based on presently known physical data, economic recoverability and operating conditions. To the extent these assumptions prove inaccurate, actual recoveries and development costs could be different than current estimates. For additional details of the estimated quantities of proved reserves at the end of each of the last three years, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Supplementary Information on Oil and Gas Producing Activities.  Preparation of Reserve Estimates  Our estimation of economically producible volumes of liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas is a highly technical process performed primarily by in-house teams of reservoir engineers and geoscience professionals. All estimates of reserves are made in compliance with SEC Rule 4-10 of Regulation S-X. Liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserve estimates are reviewed and approved by our Corporate Reserves Group, which includes our Director of Corporate Reserves and her staff of Coordinators. Reserve estimates are developed and reviewed by Qualified Reserve Estimators (“QRE”). QREs are engineers or geoscientists with a minimum of a Bachelor of Science degree in the appropriate technical field, have a minimum of three years of industry experience with at least one year in reserve estimation and have completed Marathon Oil’s Qualified Reserve Estimator training course. The Reserve Coordinators review all reserve estimates for all fields with proved reserves greater than 3 mmboe at a minimum of once every three years. Any change to proved reserve estimates in excess of 2.5 mmboe on a total field basis, within a single month, must be approved by Corporate Reserves Group management. All other proved reserve changes must be approved by a Reserve Coordinator.  Our Director of Corporate Reserves, who reports to our Chief Financial Officer, has a Bachelor of Science degree in petroleum engineering and a Master of Business Administration. Her 37 years of experience in the industry include 26 with Marathon Oil. She is active in industry and professional groups, having served on the Society of Petroleum Engineers (“SPE”) Oil and Gas Reserves Committee (“OGRC”), chairing in 2008 and 2009. As a member of the OGRC, she participated in the development of the Petroleum Resource Management System. She chaired the development of the OGRC comments on the SEC’s proposed modernization of oil and gas reporting and was a member of the American Petroleum Institute’s Ad Hoc group that provided comments on the same topic.  Estimates of synthetic crude oil reserves are prepared by GLJ Petroleum Consultants of Calgary, Canada, third-party consultants. Their reports for all years are filed as exhibits to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The engineer responsible    15    Table of Contents  for the estimates of our oil sands mining reserves has 33 years of experience in petroleum engineering and has conducted surface mineable oil sands evaluations since 1986. He is a member of SPE, having served as regional director from 1998 through 2001 and is a registered Practicing Professional Engineer in the Province of Alberta.  Audits of Estimates  Third-party consultants are engaged to provide independent estimates for fields that comprise 80 percent of our total proved reserves over a rolling four-year period for the purpose of auditing the in-house reserve estimates. We met this goal for the four-year period ended December 31, 2011. We established a tolerance level of 10 percent such that initial estimates by the third-party consultants are accepted if they are within 10 percent of our internal estimates. Should the third-party consultants’ initial analysis fail to reach our tolerance level, both our team and the consultants re-examine the information provided, request additional data and refine their analysis if appropriate. This resolution process is continued until both estimates are within 10 percent. This process did not result in significant changes to our reserve estimates in 2011 or 2009. There were no third-party audits performed in 2010.  During 2011, Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc. (“NSAI”) prepared a Certification of December 31, 2010 reserves for the Alba field in Equatorial Guinea. The NSAI summary report is filed as an exhibit to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The senior members of the NSAI team have over 50 years of industry experience between them, having worked for large, international oil and gas companies before joining NSAI. The team lead has a Master of Science in mechanical engineering and is a member of SPE. The senior technical advisor has a Bachelor of Science degree in geophysics and is a member of the Society of Exploration Geophysicists, the American Association of Petroleum Geologists and the European Association of Geoscientists and Engineers. Both are licensed in the state of Texas.  Ryder Scott Company (“Ryder Scott”) performed audits of several of our fields in 2011 and 2009. Their summary report on audits performed in 2011 is filed as an exhibit to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The team lead for Ryder Scott has over 20 years of industry experience, having worked for a major international oil and gas company before joining Ryder Scott. He has a Bachelor of Science degree in mechanical engineering, is a member of SPE and is a registered Professional Engineer in the state of Texas.  The Corporate Reserves Group also performs separate, detailed technical reviews of reserve estimates for significant fields that were acquired recently or for properties with other indicators such as excessively short or long lives, performance above or below expectations or changes in economic or operating conditions.  Changes in Proved Undeveloped Reserves  As of December 31, 2011, 395 mmboe of proved undeveloped reserves were reported, a decrease of 10 mmboe from December 31, 2010. The following table shows changes in total proved undeveloped reserves for 2011:             Beginning of year      405     Revisions of previous estimates     15     Improved recovery     1     Purchases of reserves in place     91     Extensions, discoveries, and other additions     49     Transfer to Proved Developed     (166 )                End of year     395    Significant additions to proved undeveloped reserves during 2011 include 91 mmboe due to acreage acquisition in the Eagle Ford shale, 26 mmboe related to Anadarko Woodford shale development, 10 mmboe for development drilling in the Bakken shale play and 8 mmboe for additional drilling in Norway. Additionally, 139 mmboe were transferred from proved undeveloped to proved developed reserves due to startup of the Jackpine upgrader expansion in Canada. Costs incurred in 2011, 2010 and 2009 relating to the development of proved undeveloped reserves, were $1,107 million, $1,463 million and $792 million.  Projects can remain in proved undeveloped reserves for extended periods in certain situations such as behind-pipe zones where reserves will not be accessed until the primary producing zone depletes, large development projects which take more than five years to complete, and the timing of when additional gas compression is needed. Of the 395 mmboe of proved undeveloped reserves at year end 2011, 34 percent of the volume is associated with projects that have been included in proved reserves for more than five years. The majority of this volume is related to a compression project in Equatorial Guinea that was sanctioned by our Board of Directors in 2004 and is expected to be completed by 2016. Performance of this field has exceeded expectations, and estimates of initial dry gas in place increased by roughly 10 percent between 2004 and 2010. Production is not expected to experience a natural decline from facility-limited plateau production until 2014, or possibly 2015. The timing of the installation of compression is being driven by the reservoir performance.    16    Table of Contents Proved undeveloped reserves for the North Gialo project, located in the Libyan Sahara desert, were booked for the first time as proved undeveloped reserves in 2010. This project, which is anticipated to take more than five years to be developed, is being executed by the operator and encompasses a continuous drilling program including the design, fabrication and installation of extensive liquid handling and gas recycling facilities. In 2010, an engineering firm was awarded the front-end engineering and design activities. The remoteness of the North Gialo project is expected to extend the duration of project execution more than five years after the reserves were initially booked. For example, lead time for delivery of required highly specialized compressors is approximately 24 months. There are no other significant undeveloped reserves expected to be developed more than five years after their original booking.  As of December 31, 2011, future development costs estimated to be required for the development of proved undeveloped liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserves for the years 2012 through 2016 are projected to be $2,023 million, $1,537 million, $1,229 million, $804 million, and $439 million.  The timing of future projects and estimated future development costs relating to the development of proved undeveloped liquid hydrocarbons, natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserves are forward-looking statements and are based on a number of assumptions, including (among others) commodity prices, presently known physical data concerning size and character of the reservoirs, economic recoverability, technology developments, future drilling success, industry economic conditions, levels of cash flow from operations, production experience and other operating considerations. To the extent these assumptions prove inaccurate, actual recoveries, timing and development costs could be different than current estimates.

(d)  U.S. natural gas volumes exclude volumes produced in Alaska that are stored for later sale in response to seasonal demand, although our reserves have been reduced by those volumes.      (e)   Excludes volumes acquired from third parties for injection and subsequent resale.    17    Table of Contents Average Sales Price per Unit                                                North America     Africa      Europe                 (Dollars per unit)    United  States      Canada(a)     Total     EG     Other     Total     Total     Disc.Ops(b)     Total     Year Ended December 31, 2011                                                Liquid hydrocarbons (bbl)   $ 92.55       -     $ 92.55     $ 67.70     $ 112.56     $ 73.21     $ 115.55     $ -     $ 99.37     Natural gas (mcf)     4.95       -       4.95       0.24       0.70       0.24       9.75       -       2.96     Synthetic crude oil (bbl)     -       91.65       91.65       -       -       -       -       -       91.65     Year Ended December 31, 2010                                                Liquid hydrocarbons (bbl)   $ 72.30       -     $ 72.30     $ 50.57     $ 89.15     $ 71.71     $ 81.95     $ -     $ 75.73     Natural gas (mcf)     4.71       -       4.71       0.24       0.70       0.25       7.04       -       2.82     Synthetic crude oil (bbl)     -       71.06       71.06       -       -       -       -       -       71.06     Year Ended December 31, 2009                                                Liquid hydrocarbons (bbl)   $ 54.67       -     $ 54.67     $ 38.06     $ 68.41     $ 53.91     $ 64.46     $ 56.47     $ 58.06     Natural gas (mcf)     4.14       -       4.14       0.24       0.70       0.25       4.84       8.54       2.52      (a)   Before December 31, 2009, OSM was not included in the SEC’s definition of oil and gas producing activities; therefore, synthetic crude oil prices are not reported for 2009.

(b)   Before December 31, 2009 OSM was not included in the SEC’s definition of oil and gas producing activities; therefore, production costs are not reported for 2009. Production costs in 2010 include costs associated with a major turnaround and $64 million for a water abatement accrual in 2011.      (c)   Production operations ceased in Libya in February 2011, but fixed costs continued to be incurred.      (d)   Our businesses in Ireland and Gabon were sold in 2009 and were reported as discontinued operations.  Integrated Gas  Our integrated gas operations include natural gas liquefaction operations and methanol production operations. Also included in the financial results of the Integrated Gas segment are the costs associated with ongoing development of projects to link stranded natural gas resources with key demand areas.  We hold a 60 percent interest in EGHoldings, which is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. EGHoldings has a 3.7 mmta LNG production facility on Bioko Island in EG. LNG from the production facility is sold under a 3.4 mmta, or 460 mmcfd, sales and purchase agreement with a 17-year term ending in 2024. The purchaser under the agreement takes delivery of the LNG on Bioko Island, with pricing linked principally to the Henry Hub index, regardless of destination. This production facility allows us to monetize our natural gas reserves from the Alba field, as natural gas for the facility is purchased from the Alba field participants under a long-term natural gas supply agreement. Gross sales of LNG from this production facility totaled 4.1 mmt in 2011. Planned maintenance at the LNG production facility is scheduled for a 30 day period from late first quarter through early second quarter 2012, with operations expected to be completely shut down for 10 of those days. In 2011, we continued discussions with the government of EG and our partners regarding a potential second LNG production train on Bioko Island.  We own a 45 percent interest in AMPCO, which is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. AMPCO owns a methanol plant located on Bioko Island in Equatorial Guinea. Feedstock for the plant is supplied from our natural gas production from the Alba field. Gross sales of methanol from the plant totaled 1.04, 0.85 and 0.96 mmt in 2011, 2010 and 2009. Production from the plant is used to supply customers in Europe and the U.S.    18    Table of Contents We sold our 30 percent outside-operated interest in a natural gas liquefaction plant in Kenai Alaska in the third quarter of 2011 at which time our sales from this facility ceased.  The above discussion of the Integrated Gas segment contains forward-looking statements with respect to the planned maintenance and possible expansion of the LNG production facility in Equatorial Guinea. Factors that could potentially affect the possible expansion of the LNG production facility include partner and government approvals, access to sufficient natural gas volumes through exploration or commercial negotiations with other resource owners and access to sufficient regasification capacity. Predicted planned maintenance and downtime are good faith estimates and preliminary, and therefore, subject to change. The foregoing factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.  Competition and Market Conditions  Strong competition exists in all sectors of the oil and gas industry and, in particular, in the exploration for and development of new reserves. We compete with major integrated and independent oil and gas companies, as well as national oil companies, for the acquisition of oil and natural gas leases and other properties. We compete with these companies for the equipment and labor required to develop and operate those properties and in the marketing of oil and natural gas to end-users. Many of our competitors have financial and other resources greater than those available to us. Acquiring exploration opportunities frequently requires competitive bids involving front-end bonus payments or commitments-to-work programs. We also compete in attracting and retaining personnel, including petroleum engineers, geologists, geophysicists and other specialists. Based upon statistics compiled in the “2011 Global Upstream Performance Review” published by IHS Herold Inc., we rank tenth among U.S.-based petroleum companies on the basis of 2010 worldwide liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas production.  We also compete with other producers of synthetic and conventional crude oil for the sale of our synthetic crude oil to refineries primarily in North America. Additional synthetic crude oil projects are being contemplated by various competitors and, if undertaken and completed, these projects may result in a significant increase in the supply of synthetic crude oil to the market. Since not all refineries are able to process or refine synthetic crude oil in significant volumes, there can be no assurance that sufficient market demand will exist at all times to absorb our share of the synthetic crude oil production from the AOSP at economically viable prices.  Our operating results are affected by price changes in conventional and synthetic crude oil, natural gas and petroleum products, as well as changes in competitive conditions in the markets we serve. Generally, results from production and oil sands mining operations benefit from higher crude oil prices. Market conditions in the oil and gas industry are cyclical and subject to global economic and political events and new and changing governmental regulations. See Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Overview – Market Conditions for additional discussion of the impact of prices on our operations.  Environmental, Health and Safety Matters  The Health, Environmental, Safety and Corporate Responsibility Committee of our Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing our position on public issues, including environmental, health and safety matters. Our Corporate Health, Environment, Safety and Security organization has the responsibility to ensure that our operating organizations maintain environmental compliance systems that support and foster our compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Committees comprised of certain of our officers review our overall performance associated with various environmental compliance programs. We also have a Corporate Emergency Response Team which oversees our response to any major environmental or other emergency incident involving us or any of our properties.  Our businesses are subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, health and safety. These laws and regulations include the Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”) with respect to the protection of health and safety of employees, the Clean Air Act (“CAA”) with respect to air emissions, the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (also known as the Clean Water Act (“CWA”) with respect to water discharges, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”) with respect to releases and remediation of hazardous substances, the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (“OPA-90”) with respect to oil pollution and response, the National Environmental Policy Act with respect to evaluation of environmental impacts, the Endangered Species Act with respect to the protection of endangered or threatened species, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) with respect to solid and hazardous waste treatment, storage and disposal, and the U.S. Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act with respect to the dissemination of information relating to certain chemical inventories. In addition, many other states and countries in which where we operate have their own similar laws dealing with similar matters.  These laws and regulations could result in costs to remediate releases of regulated substances, including crude oil, into the environment, or costs to remediate sites to which we sent regulated substances for disposal. In some cases, these    19    Table of Contents  laws can impose liability for the entire cost of clean-up on any responsible party without regard to negligence or fault and impose liability on us for the conduct of others (such as prior owners or operators of our assets) or conditions others have caused, or for our acts that complied with all applicable requirements when we performed them. New laws have been enacted and regulations are being adopted by various regulatory agencies on a continuing basis and the costs of compliance with these new rules can only be broadly appraised until their implementation becomes more defined. Based on regulatory trends, particularly with respect to the CAA and its implementing regulations, we have incurred and will continue to incur substantial capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations. We believe that substantially all of our competitors must comply with similar environmental laws and regulations. However, the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of its operating facilities, marketing areas and production processes.  For a discussion of environmental capital expenditures and costs of compliance for air, water, solid waste and remediation, see Item 3. Legal Proceedings and Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Environmental Matters, Litigation and Contingencies.  Air  In August 2011, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“U.S. EPA”) published proposed New Source Performance Standards (“NSPS”) and National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (“NESHAP”) that will both amend existing NSPS and NESHAP standards for oil and gas facilities as well as create a new NSPS for oil and gas production, transmission and distribution facilities. If the proposed rules are finalized without substantial modification, compliance with the rules will result in an increase in costs of control, equipment and labor and require additional notification, monitoring, reporting and recordkeeping. The U.S. EPA is required to finalize this rule by April, 2012.  In July 2011, the U.S. EPA finalized a Federal Implementation Plan under the CAA that includes New Source Review (“NSR”) regulations which apply to air emissions sources on Tribal Lands. This rule became effective on August 30, 2011, and requires the registration and/or pre-construction permitting of most of our facilities on Tribal Lands in Wyoming, Oklahoma and North Dakota. To minimize pre-construction delays in the near term, we entered into an Administrative Compliance and Consent Agreement (“Agreement”) that temporarily suspended the requirement for pre-construction permits for facilities on Trial Lands in North Dakota as long as permit applications were filed in accordance with the Agreement. We cannot reasonably estimate the financial impact of these permitting requirements until the U.S. EPA finalizes its internal permitting procedures. The U.S. EPA has indicated that this rule will be finalized during the first half of 2012.  Climate Change  In 2010, the U.S. EPA promulgated rules that required us to monitor and submit an annual report on our greenhouse gas emissions. Further, state, national and international requirements to reduce greenhouse emissions are being proposed and in some cased promulgated. These requirements apply or could apply in countries in which we operate. Potential legislation and regulations pertaining to climate change could also affect our operations. The cost to comply with these laws and regulations cannot be estimated at this time. For additional information, see Item 1A. Risk Factors. As part of our commitment to environmental stewardship, we estimate and publicly report greenhouse gas emissions from our operations. We are working to continuously improve the accuracy and completeness of these estimates. In addition, we continuously strive to improve operational and energy efficiencies through resource and energy conservation where practicable and cost effective.  Hydraulic Fracturing  Hydraulic fracturing is a commonly used process that involves injecting water, sand, and small volumes of chemicals into the wellbore to fracture the hydrocarbon-bearing rock thousands of feet below the surface to facilitate higher flow of hydrocarbons into the wellbore. Hydraulic fracturing has been regulated at the state level through permitting and compliance requirements. State level initiatives in regions with substantial shale resources have been or may be proposed or implemented to further regulate hydraulic fracturing practices, limit water withdrawals and water use, require disclosure of fracturing fluid constituents, restrict which additives may be used, or implement temporary or permanent bans on hydraulic fracturing. In addition, the U.S. Congress has considered legislation that would require regulation affecting the hydraulic fracturing process. In the first quarter of 2010, the U.S. EPA announced its intention to conduct a comprehensive research study on the potential effects that hydraulic fracturing may have on water quality and public health. The U.S. EPA has begun preparation for the study and expects to issue an interim report in 2012 followed by a final report in 2014.  Increased regulation and attention given to the hydraulic fracturing process could lead to greater opposition to oil and gas production activities using hydraulic fracturing techniques. Additional legislation or regulation could also lead to operational delays or increased operating costs in the production of oil and natural gas from the developing shale plays, or could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing. The adoption of any federal or state laws or the    20    Table of Contents  implementation of regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing could potentially cause a decrease in the completion of new oil and gas wells and increased compliance costs, which could increase costs of our operations and cause considerable delays in acquiring regulatory approvals to drill and complete wells.  Remediation  The AOSP operations use established processes to mine deposits of bitumen from an open-pit mine, extract the bitumen and upgrade it into synthetic crude oils. Tailings are waste products created from the oil sands extraction process which are placed in ponds. The AOSP is required to reclaim its tailing ponds as part of its ongoing reclamation work. The reclamation process uses developing technology and there is an inherent risk that the current process may not be as effective or perform as required in order to meet the approved closure and reclamation plan. The AOSP continues to develop its current reclamation technology and continues to investigate alternate tailings management technologies. In February 2009, the Alberta Energy Resources Conservation Board (“ERCB”) issued a Directive which more clearly defines criteria for managing oil sands tailings. The AOSP joint venture operator submitted tailings management papers to the ERCB for both mines setting forth plans to comply with the Directive which received approval, with conditions, in the second half of 2010. Further new regulations or failure to comply in a timely manner could result in additional cost to us.  Concentrations of Credit Risk  We are exposed to credit risk in the event of nonpayment by counterparties, a significant portion of which are concentrated in energy-related industries. The creditworthiness of customers and other counterparties is subject to continuing review, including the use of master netting agreements, where appropriate. For the years 2011, 2010 and 2009, transactions with MPC accounted for more than 10 percent of our annual revenues. The majority of those transactions occurred while MPC was a wholly-owned subsidiary. In addition, for the years 2010 and 2009, sales of crude oil to the Libyan National Oil Company accounted for more than 10 percent of our annual revenues. These transactions were restricted to sales of crude oil produced in Libya during those periods.  Trademarks, Patents and Licenses  We currently hold a number of U.S. and foreign patents and have various pending patent applications. Although in the aggregate our trademarks, patents and licenses are important to us, we do not regard any single trademark, patent, license or group of related trademarks, patents or licenses as critical or essential to our business as a whole.  Employees  We had 3,322 active, full-time employees as of December 31, 2011. We consider labor relations with our employees to be satisfactory. We have not had any work stoppages or strikes pertaining to our employees.

Risk Factors  We are subject to various risks and uncertainties in the course of our business. The following summarizes significant risks and uncertainties that may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.  A substantial or extended decline in liquid hydrocarbon or natural gas prices would reduce our operating results and cash flows and could adversely impact our future rate of growth and the carrying value of our assets.  Prices for liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas fluctuate widely. Our revenues, operating results and future rate of growth are highly dependent on the prices we receive for our liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas. Historically, the markets for liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas have been volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future. Many of the factors influencing prices of liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas are beyond our control. These factors include:       •    worldwide and domestic supplies of and demand for liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas;        •    the cost of exploring for, developing and producing liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas;        •    the ability of the members of OPEC to agree to and maintain production controls;        •    political instability or armed conflict in oil and natural gas producing regions;        •    changes in weather patterns and climate;        •    natural disasters such as hurricanes and tornados;        •    the price and availability of alternative and competing forms of energy;        •    domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes; and        •    general economic conditions worldwide.  The long-term effects of these and other factors on the prices of liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas are uncertain.  Lower liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas prices may cause us to reduce the amount of these commodities that we produce, which may reduce our revenues, operating income and cash flows. Significant reductions in liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas prices could require us to reduce our capital expenditures or impair the carrying value of our assets.    22    Table of Contents Our offshore operations involve special risks that could negatively impact us.  Offshore exploration and development operations present technological challenges and operating risks because of the marine environment. Activities in deepwater areas may pose incrementally greater risks because of water depths that limit intervention capability and the physical distance to oilfield service infrastructure and service providers. Environmental remediation and other costs resulting from spills or releases may result in substantial liabilities.  Estimates of liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserves depend on many factors and assumptions, including various assumptions that are based on conditions in existence as of the dates of the estimates. Any material changes in those conditions or other factors affecting those assumptions could impair the quantity and value of our liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserves.  The proved reserve information included in this Report has been derived from engineering estimates. Estimates of liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves were prepared by our in-house teams of reservoir engineers and geoscience professionals and were reviewed, on a selected basis, by our Corporate Reserves Group. The synthetic crude oil reserves estimates were prepared by GLJ Petroleum Consultants, a third-party consulting firm experienced in working with oil sands. Reserves were valued based on the unweighted average of closing prices for the first day of each month in the 12-month period ended December 31, 2011, as well as other conditions in existence at the date. Any significant future price change will have a material effect on the quantity and present value of our proved reserves. Future reserve revisions could also result from changes in governmental regulation, among other things.  Reserve estimation is a subjective process that involves estimating volumes to be recovered from underground accumulations of liquid hydrocarbons, natural gas and bitumen that cannot be directly measured. (Bitumen is mined and then upgraded into synthetic crude oil.) Estimates of economically producible reserves and of future net cash flows depend on a number of variable factors and assumptions, including:       •    location, size and shape of the accumulation as well as fluid, rock and producing characteristics of the accumulation;        •    historical production from the area, compared with production from other comparable producing areas;        •    volumes of bitumen in-place and various factors affecting the recoverability of bitumen and its conversion into synthetic crude oil such as historical upgrader performance;        •    the assumed effects of regulation by governmental agencies;        •    assumptions concerning future operating costs, severance and excise taxes, development costs and workover and repair costs; and        •    industry economic conditions, levels of cash flows from operations and other operating considerations.  As a result, different petroleum engineers, each using industry-accepted geologic and engineering practices and scientific methods, may produce different estimates of proved reserves and future net cash flows based on the same available data. Because of the subjective nature of such reserve estimates, each of the following items may differ materially from the amounts or other factors estimated:        •    the amount and timing of production;        •    the revenues and costs associated with that production; and        •    the amount and timing of future development expenditures.  The discounted future net revenues from our proved liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserves reflected in this Report should not be considered as the market value of the reserves attributable to our properties. As required by SEC Rule 4-10 of Regulation S-X, the estimated discounted future net revenues from our proved liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserves are based on an unweighted average of closing prices for the first day of each month in the 12-month period ended December 31, 2011, and costs applicable at the date of the estimate, while actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower.  In addition, the 10 percent discount factor required by the applicable rules of the SEC to be used to calculate discounted future net revenues for reporting purposes is not necessarily the most appropriate discount factor based on our cost of capital and the risks associated with our business and the oil and natural gas industry in general.    23    Table of Contents If we are unsuccessful in acquiring or finding additional reserves, our future liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas production would decline, thereby reducing our cash flows and results of operations and impairing our financial condition.  The rate of production from liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas properties generally declines as reserves are depleted. Except to the extent we acquire interests in additional properties containing proved reserves, conduct successful exploration and development activities or, through engineering studies, optimize production performance, identify additional reservoirs not currently producing or secondary recovery reserves, our proved reserves will decline materially as liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas are produced. Accordingly, to the extent we are not successful in replacing the liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas we produce, our future revenues will decline. Creating and maintaining an inventory of prospects for future production depends on many factors, including:       •    obtaining rights to explore for, develop and produce liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas in promising areas;        •    drilling success;        •    the ability to complete long lead-time, capital-intensive projects timely and on budget;        •    the ability to find or acquire additional proved reserves at acceptable costs; and        •    the ability to fund such activity.  Future exploration and drilling results are uncertain and involve substantial costs. Drilling for liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas involves numerous risks, including the risk that we may not encounter commercially productive liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reservoirs. The costs of drilling, completing and operating wells are often uncertain, and drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors, including:        •    unexpected drilling conditions;        •    title problems;        •    pressure or irregularities in formations;        •    equipment failures or accidents;        •    fires, explosions, blowouts and surface cratering;        •    lack of access to pipelines or other transportation methods; and        •    shortages or delays in the availability of services or delivery of equipment.  If we are unable to complete capital projects at their expected costs and in a timely manner, or if the market conditions assumed in our project economics deteriorate, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.  Delays or cost increases related to capital spending programs involving engineering, procurement and construction of facilities (including improvements and repairs to our existing facilities) could adversely affect our ability to achieve forecasted internal rates of return and operating results. Delays in making required changes or upgrades to our facilities could subject us to fines or penalties as well as affect our ability to supply certain products we produce. Such delays or cost increases may arise as a result of unpredictable factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:        •    denial of or delay in receiving requisite regulatory approvals and/or permits;        •    unplanned increases in the cost of construction materials or labor;        •    disruptions in transportation of components or construction materials;        •    adverse weather conditions, natural disasters or other events (such as equipment malfunctions, explosions, fires or spills) affecting our facilities, or those of vendors or suppliers;        •    shortages of sufficiently skilled labor, or labor disagreements resulting in unplanned work stoppages;        •    market-related increases in a project’s debt or equity financing costs; and        •    nonperformance by, or disputes with, vendors, suppliers, contractors or subcontractors.  Any one or more of these factors could have a significant impact on our ongoing capital projects.    24    Table of Contents We may incur substantial capital expenditures and operating costs as a result of compliance with, and changes in environmental health, safety and security laws and regulations, and, as a result, our business, financial condition, results of operation and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.  Our businesses are subject to numerous laws, regulations and other requirements relating to the protection of the environment, including those relating to the discharge of materials into the environment such as the venting or flaring of natural gas, waste management, pollution prevention, greenhouse gas emissions, as well as laws and regulations relating to public and employee safety and health and to facility security. We have incurred and may continue to incur substantial capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures as a result of these laws and regulations. To the extent these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products, our operating results will be adversely affected. The specific impact of these laws and regulations may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of operating facilities and production processes. We may also be required to make material expenditures to modify operations, install pollution control equipment, perform site cleanups or curtail operations that could materially and adversely affect business, financial condition, results of operation and cash flows. We may become subject to liabilities that we currently do not anticipate in connection with new, amended or more stringent requirements, stricter interpretations of existing requirements or the future discovery of contamination. In addition, any failure by us to comply with existing or future laws or regulations could result in civil penalties or criminal fines and other enforcement actions against us.  We believe it is likely that the scientific and political attention to issues concerning the extent, causes of and responsibility for climate change will continue, with the potential for further regulations that could affect our operations. Currently, various legislative and regulatory measures to address greenhouse gas emissions (including carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxides) are in various phases of review, discussion or implementation in countries where we operate, including the U.S., Canada, and Norway, and the European Union. Our operations result in these greenhouse gas emissions. Through 2011, domestic legislative and regulatory efforts included proposed federal legislation and state actions to develop statewide or regional programs, each of which could impose reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. Further, in December 2011 at the Durban Climate Change Conference, countries such as the U.S., China and India, and the European Union agreed in principal to replace the Kyoto Protocol (which expires in 2012) with a new legally binding agreement. However, at this time it is not certain whether a legally binding resolution will be reached, what the terms of any agreement would be, or whether the U.S. Senate would ratify such an agreement. These actions could result in increased: (1) costs to operate and maintain our facilities, (2) capital expenditures to install new emission controls at our facilities, and (3) costs to administer and manage any potential greenhouse gas emissions or carbon trading or tax programs. These costs and capital expenditures could be material. Although uncertain, these developments could increase our costs, reduce the demand for liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas, and create delays in our obtaining air pollution permits for new or modified facilities.  Although there may be adverse financial impact (including compliance costs, potential permitting delays and potential reduced demand for liquid hydrocarbons or natural gas) associated with any legislation, regulation, or other action by the U.S. EPA, the extent and magnitude of that impact cannot be reliably or accurately estimated due to the fact that requirements have only recently been adopted and the present uncertainty regarding any additional measures and how they will be implemented. Private party litigation has also been brought against some emitters of greenhouse gas emissions.  The potential adoption of federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives related to hydraulic fracturing could result in operating restrictions or delays in the completion of oil and gas wells.  Hydraulic fracturing is a commonly used process that involves injecting water, sand, and small volumes of chemicals into the wellbore to fracture the hydrocarbon-bearing rock thousands of feet below the surface to facilitate higher flow of hydrocarbons into the wellbore. The U.S. Congress has considered legislation that would require additional regulation affecting the hydraulic fracturing process. Consideration of new federal regulation and increased state oversight continues to arise. The U.S. EPA announced in the first quarter of 2010 its intention to conduct a comprehensive research study on the potential effects that hydraulic fracturing may have on water quality and public health. The U.S. EPA has begun preparation for the study and expects to issue an interim report in 2012 followed by a final report in 2014. In addition, various state-level initiatives in regions with substantial shale gas resources have been or may be proposed or implemented to further regulate hydraulic fracturing practices, limit water withdrawals and water use, require disclosure of fracturing fluid constituents, restrict which additives may be used, or implement temporary or permanent bans on hydraulic fracturing. Increased regulation and attention given to the hydraulic fracturing process could lead to greater opposition, including litigation, to oil and gas production activities using hydraulic fracturing techniques. Additional legislation or regulation could also lead to operational delays or increased operating costs in the production of oil and natural gas, including from the developing shale plays, or could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing. The adoption of any federal or state laws or the implementation of regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing could potentially cause a decrease in the completion of new oil and gas wells and increased compliance costs.    25    Table of Contents Worldwide political and economic developments could damage our operations and materially reduce our profitability and cash flows.  Local political and economic factors in global markets could have a material adverse effect on us. A total of 64 percent of our liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas sales volumes in 2011 was derived from production outside the U.S. and 64 percent of our proved liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves as of December 31, 2011, were located outside the U.S. All of our synthetic crude oil production and proved reserves are located in Canada. We are, therefore, subject to the political, geographic and economic risks and possible terrorist activities attendant to doing business with suppliers located within or outside of the U.S. There are many risks associated with operations in countries and in global markets, such as Equatorial Guinea, Indonesia, Libya and the Iraqi Kurdistan Region, including:       •    changes in governmental policies relating to liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas, bitumen or synthetic crude oil pricing and taxation;        •    other political, economic or diplomatic developments and international monetary fluctuations;        •    political and economic instability, war, acts of terrorism and civil disturbances;        •    the possibility that a government may seize our property with or without compensation, may attempt to renegotiate or revoke existing contractual arrangements or may impose additional taxes or royalty burdens; and        •    fluctuating currency values, hard currency shortages and currency controls.  Since January 2010, there have been varying degrees of political instability and public protests, including demonstrations which have been marked by violence, within some countries in the Middle East including Bahrain, Egypt, Libya, Syria, Tunisia and Yemen. Some political regimes in these countries are threatened or have changed as a result of such unrest. If such unrest continues to spread, conflicts could result in civil wars, regional conflicts, and regime changes resulting in governments that are hostile to the U.S. These may have the following results, among others:        •    volatility in global crude oil prices which could negatively impact the global economy, resulting in slower economic growth rates and reduced demand for our products;        •    negative impact on the world crude oil supply if transportation avenues are disrupted;        •    security concerns leading to the prolonged evacuation of our personnel;        •    damage to, or the inability to access, production facilities or other operating assets; and        •    inability of our service and equipment providers to deliver items necessary for us to conduct our operations.  Continued hostilities in the Middle East and the occurrence or threat of future terrorist attacks could adversely affect the economies of the U.S. and other developed countries. A lower level of economic activity could result in a decline in energy consumption, which could cause our revenues and margins to decline and limit our future growth prospects. These risks could lead to increased volatility in prices for liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas. In addition, these risks could increase instability in the financial and insurance markets and make it more difficult for us to access capital and to obtain the insurance coverage that we consider adequate. Actions of governments through tax and other legislation, executive order and commercial restrictions could reduce our operating profitability, both in the U.S. and abroad. The U.S. government can prevent or restrict us from doing business in foreign countries. These restrictions and those of foreign governments have in the past limited our ability to operate in, or gain access to, opportunities in various countries and will continue to do so in the future.  Many of our major projects and operations are conducted with partners, which may decrease our ability to manage risk.  We often enter into arrangements to conduct certain business operations, such oil and gas exploration and production, oil sands mining or pipeline transportation, with partners in order to share risks associated with those operations. However, these arrangements also may decrease our ability to manage risks and costs, particularly where we are not the operator. We could have limited influence over and control of the behaviors and performance of these operations. In addition, misconduct, fraud, noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations or improper activities by or on behalf of one or more of our partners could have a significant negative impact on our business and reputation.  Our operations are subject to business interruptions and casualty losses. We do not insure against all potential losses and therefore we could be seriously harmed by unexpected liabilities and increased costs.  Our exploration and production operations are subject to unplanned occurrences, including blowouts, explosions, fires, loss of well control, spills, hurricanes and other adverse weather, tsunamis, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions or nuclear or    26    Table of Contents  other disasters, labor disputes and accidents. Our oil sands mining operations are subject to business interruptions due to breakdown or failure of equipment or processes and unplanned events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions or other interruptions. These same risks can be applied to the third-parties which transport crude oil from our facilities. A prolonged disruption in the ability of any pipeline or vessels to transport crude oil could contribute to a business interruption or increase costs.  Our operations are also subject to the additional hazards of pollution, releases of toxic gas and other environmental hazards and risks. These hazards could result in serious personal injury or loss of human life, significant damage to property and equipment, environmental pollution, impairment of operations and substantial losses to us. Various hazards have adversely affected us in the past, and damages resulting from a catastrophic occurrence in the future involving us or any of our assets or operations may result in our being named as a defendant in one or more lawsuits asserting potentially large claims or in our being assessed potentially substantial fines by governmental authorities. We maintain insurance against many, but not all, potential losses or liabilities arising from operating hazards in amounts that we believe to be prudent. Uninsured losses and liabilities arising from operating hazards could reduce the funds available to us for capital, exploration and investment spending and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Historically, we have maintained insurance coverage for physical damage and resulting business interruption to our major onshore and offshore facilities, with significant self-insured retentions. In the future, we may not be able to maintain or obtain insurance of the type and amount we desire at reasonable rates. As a result of market conditions, premiums and deductibles for certain of our insurance policies have increased substantially and could escalate further. In some instances, certain insurance could become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. For example, due to hurricane activity in recent years, the availability of insurance coverage for our offshore facilities for windstorms in the Gulf of Mexico region has been reduced or, in many instances, it is prohibitively expensive. As a result, our exposure to losses from future windstorm activity in the Gulf of Mexico region has increased.  Litigation by private plaintiffs or government officials could adversely affect our performance.  We currently are defending litigation and anticipate that we will be required to defend new litigation in the future. The subject matter of such litigation may include releases of hazardous substances from our facilities, privacy laws, antitrust laws or any other laws or regulations that apply to our operations. In some cases the plaintiff or plaintiffs seek alleged damages involving large classes of potential litigants, and may allege damages relating to extended periods of time or other alleged facts and circumstances. If we are not able to successfully defend such claims, they may result in substantial liability. We do not have insurance covering all of these potential liabilities. In addition to substantial liability, litigation may also seek injunctive relief which could have an adverse effect on our future operations.  In connection with our separation from MPC, MPC agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities. However, there can be no assurance that the indemnity will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities, or that MPC’s ability to satisfy its indemnification obligations will not be impaired in the future.  Pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement and the tax sharing agreement we entered into with MPC in connection with the spin-off, MPC agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities. However, third parties could seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that MPC agreed to retain or assume, and there can be no assurance that the indemnification from MPC will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities, or that MPC will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations. In addition, even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from MPC any amounts for which we are held liable, we may be temporarily required to bear these losses ourselves.  The spin-off could result in substantial tax liability.  We obtained a private letter ruling from the IRS substantially to the effect that the distribution of shares of MPC common stock in the spin-off qualified as tax free to MPC, us and our stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 355 and 368 and related provisions of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). If the factual assumptions or representations made in the request for the private letter ruling prove to have been inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect, then we will not be able to rely on the ruling. Furthermore, the IRS does not rule on whether a distribution such as the spin-off satisfies certain requirements necessary to obtain tax-free treatment under Section 355 of the Code. Rather, the private letter ruling was based on representations by us that those requirements were satisfied, and any inaccuracy in those representations could invalidate the ruling. In connection with the spin-off, we also obtained an opinion of outside counsel, substantially to the effect that, the distribution of shares of MPC common stock in the spin-off qualified as tax free to MPC, us and our stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 355 and 368 and related provisions of the Code. The opinion relied on, among other things, the continuing validity of the private letter ruling and various assumptions and representations as to factual matters made by MPC and us which, if inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect, would jeopardize the conclusions reached by such counsel in its opinion. The opinion is not binding on the IRS or the courts, and there can be no assurance that the IRS or the courts would not challenge the conclusions stated in the opinion or that any such challenge would not prevail.    27    Table of Contents If, notwithstanding receipt of the private letter ruling and opinion of counsel, the spin-off were determined not to qualify under Section 355 of the Code, each U.S. holder of our common stock who received shares of MPC common stock in the spin-off would generally be treated as receiving a taxable distribution of property in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares of MPC common stock received. That distribution would be taxable to each such stockholder as a dividend to the extent of our accumulated earnings and profits as of the effective date of the spin-off. For each such stockholder, any amount that exceeded those earnings and profits would be treated first as a non-taxable return of capital to the extent of such stockholder’s tax basis in its shares of our common stock with any remaining amount being taxed as a capital gain. We would be subject to tax as if we had sold all the outstanding shares of MPC common stock in a taxable sale for their fair market value and would recognize taxable gain in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of such shares over our tax basis in such shares.  Under the terms of the tax sharing agreement we entered into with MPC in connection with the spin-off, MPC is generally responsible for any taxes imposed on MPC or us and our subsidiaries in the event that the spin-off and/or certain related transactions were to fail to qualify for tax-free treatment as a result of actions taken, or breaches of representations and warranties made in the tax sharing agreement, by MPC or any of its affiliates. However, if the spin-off and/or certain related transactions were to fail to qualify for tax-free treatment because of actions or failures to act by us or any of our affiliates, we would be responsible for all such taxes.  We may issue preferred stock whose terms could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of Marathon Oil common stock.  Our restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such preferences, powers and relative, participating, optional and other rights, including preferences over Marathon Oil common stock respecting dividends and distributions, as our Board of Directors generally may determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of Marathon Oil common stock. For example, we could grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the common stock.  Item 1B.
