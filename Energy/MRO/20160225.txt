Business GeneralMarathon Oil Corporation is an independent global exploration and production company based in Houston, Texas, with operations in North America, Europe and Africa. Our corporate headquarters are located at 5555 San Felipe Street, Houston, Texas 77056-2723 and our telephone number is (713) 629-6600. Each of our three reportable operating segments is organized based upon both geographic location and the nature of the products and services it offers.•North America E&P – explores for, produces and markets crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas in North America;•International E&P – explores for, produces and markets crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas outside of North America and produces and markets products manufactured from natural gas, such as LNG and methanol, in E.G.; and•Oil Sands Mining – mines, extracts and transports bitumen from oil sands deposits in Alberta, Canada, and upgrades the bitumen to produce and market synthetic crude oil and vacuum gas oil. We were incorporated in 2001. On June 30, 2011, we completed the spin-off of our downstream business, creating two independent energy companies: Marathon Oil and MPC.Strategy and Results SummaryMarathon Oil’s strategy is to safely and sustainably deliver value by investing in low cost, liquids-rich projects with a focus on risk-adjusted rates of return. We are focused in the high quality core of three premier unconventional resource plays in the U.S.: the Eagle Ford, Bakken and Oklahoma Resource Basins. Our strategy for our operated conventional producing assets in E.G., the U.K. and the U.S. is to maximize value and cash flow to provide flexibility to invest in the shorter cycle opportunities in the U.S. resource plays. Our conventional exploration program is currently limited to existing commitments in the Gulf of Mexico and Gabon. Our strategy is guided by the following seven strategic imperatives ("SI7"):1.Living Our Values 2.Investing in Our People 3.Continuous Improvement in Operational and Capital Efficiency 4.Driving Profitable and Sustainable Growth5.Rigorous Portfolio Management 6.Quality and Material Resource Capture 7.Delivering Long-Term Shareholder Value Commodity prices are the most significant factor impacting our revenues, profitability, operating cash flows and the amount of capital available to reinvest into our business. The low pricing environment has presented several challenges for us and our industry. We responded to the lower commodity prices in a number of ways:•Reduced our 2015 Capital Program by approximately 50% from the prior year, down to $3 billion•Established our 2016 Capital Program at $1.4 billion•Exercised cost discipline, significantly reducing drilling and completion, production and general and administrative costs•Drove sustainable operational efficiency gains in the U.S. unconventional resource plays•Scaled back our conventional exploration program to focus on our U.S. unconventional resources plays•Increased our target for non-core asset sales, now $750 million to $1 billion, up from our previous goal of $500 million◦Closed over $300 million of non-core asset sales (excluding closing adjustments)•Protected our liquidity and capital structure:◦Issued $2 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes ($1 billion of which was used to repay the 0.90% senior notes that matured in November 2015) ◦Increased the capacity of the revolving credit facility from $2.5 billion to $3.0 billion while also extending the maturity date an additional year to May 2020◦Decreased our quarterly dividend from $0.21 to $0.05 per share, saving approximately $425 million of cash on an annualized basis5In 2015, we continued to focus on the U.S. unconventional resource plays. We progressed co-development in the Eagle Ford, further delineated Austin Chalk in the Eagle Ford along with SCOOP/STACK in the Oklahoma Resource Basins and improved overall competitiveness in the Bakken with cost reductions and enhanced completions. Our U.S. operations added 73 mmboe proved reserves in 2015, excluding acquisitions, dispositions and production, amounting to an increase of 107% over the prior year's ending balance. Net sales volumes from continuing operations increased by 6% to 438 mboed in 2015 from 415 mboed in 2014. Volumes from our three U.S. resource plays totaled 218 mboed, an increase of 20% from 181 mboed in 2014. For the total company, we ended 2015 with proved reserves of approximately 2,163 mmboe as compared to 2,198  mmboe at the end of 2014. See Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Outlook, for a more detailed discussion of our operating results, cash flows and outlook, including the 2016 Capital Program.The map below shows the locations of our worldwide operations.Segment and Geographic InformationFor operating segment and geographic financial information, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements.In the following discussion regarding our North America E&P, International E&P and Oil Sands Mining segments, references to net wells, acres, sales or investment indicate our ownership interest or share, as the context requires.North America E&P SegmentWe are engaged in oil and gas exploration, development and/or production activities in the U.S. and Canada. Our primary focus in the North America E&P segment is concentrated within our unconventional resource plays. The following tables provide additional detail regarding net sales volumes, sales mix and operated drilling activity:6Net Sales Volumes2015 Increase(Decrease) 2014 Increase(Decrease) 2013Equivalent Barrels (mboed)          Eagle Ford134 20 % 112 38 % 81 Oklahoma Resource Basins25 39 % 18 29 % 14 Bakken59 16 % 51 31 % 39 Other North America (a)51 (11)% 57 (15)% 67 Total North America E&P (mboed)269 13 % 238 18 % 201(a) Includes Gulf of Mexico and other conventional onshore U.S. productionSales Mix - U.S. Resource Plays - 2015Eagle Ford Oklahoma Resource Basins BakkenCrude oil and condensate60% 19% 87%Natural gas liquids19% 28% 7%Natural gas21% 53% 6%Drilling Activity - U.S. Resource Plays2015 2014 2013Gross Operated      Eagle Ford:      Wells drilled to total depth251 360 299 Wells brought to sales276 310 307 Oklahoma Resource Basins:      Wells drilled to total depth20 19 10 Wells brought to sales21 18 9 Bakken:      Wells drilled to total depth35 83 76 Wells brought to sales56 69 77Eagle Ford - As of December 31, 2015, we had approximately 153,000 net acres in the Eagle Ford in south Texas and 1,236 gross (911 net) operated producing wells, where we have been operating since 2011. Of the 276 gross wells brought to sales in 2015, 56 were in the Austin Chalk, 28 were in the Upper Eagle Ford and 192 were in the Lower Eagle Ford. Of the 310 gross wells brought to sales in 2014, 22 were in the Austin Chalk and four were in the Upper Eagle Ford. Our 2015 average spud-to-TD time was 11 days compared to 13 days in 2014. Our high-density pad drilling continues to average approximately four wells per pad in 2015. The continued focus on stimulation design has contributed to incremental improvements in well performance across our area of activity. During 2015, we continued evaluation of the Austin Chalk formation and began delineation of Upper Eagle Ford across our acreage position in south Texas, with a total of 22,000 Austin Chalk acres and 16,500 Upper Eagle Ford acres now delineated. The mix of crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas from the Austin Chalk wells is similar to Eagle Ford condensate wells. Co-development of the Austin Chalk, Upper and Lower Eagle Ford horizons will leverage the infrastructure investments we have made to support production growth across the Eagle Ford operating area. We operate approximately 800 miles of gathering pipeline in the Eagle Ford area. We now have 32 central gathering and treating facilities, with aggregate capacity of more than 475 mboed. We also own and operate the Sugarloaf gathering system, a 42-mile natural gas pipeline through the heart of our acreage in Karnes, Atascosa and Bee Counties of south Texas.In late 2015, we connected to a newly constructed third-party liquids pipeline, which allowed us to increase the amount of our Eagle Ford production transported by pipeline to 90% at year-end, up from an average of 70% during 2014. The ability to transport more barrels by pipeline enables us to improve/optimize price realizations, reduce costs, improve reliability and lessen our environmental footprint. Approximately 42% of our 2016 Capital Program, $600 million, is allocated to the Eagle Ford. We expect drilling activity to average five rigs in 2016. Our drilling plans for 2016 include drilling 91 - 96 net wells (150 - 160 gross, of which we will operate 134 - 141). We anticipate bringing 124 - 132 gross operated wells to sales during 2016.Oklahoma Resource Basins – Our primary focus in 2016 will be in the SCOOP and STACK areas. In the SCOOP and STACK areas we hold approximately 265,000 net acres with rights to the Woodford, Springer, Meramec, Granite Wash and 7other Pennsylvanian and Mississippian plays. This includes 8,000 net acres added in the Oklahoma Resource Basins, primarily in the STACK Meramec play during 2015. Approximately 90% of our SCOOP acreage is held by production. In the SCOOP Woodford, we delineated over 70% of our acreage. We estimate the SCOOP Springer has a high oil yield that is about 85% liquids. We believe about 80% of our acreage in STACK has the potential for co-development of multiple horizons. About 67,000 STACK Woodford acres are delineated while approximately 42,000 acres of STACK Meramec acreage is delineated. Approximately 14% of our 2016 Capital Program, $204 million, is allocated to the Oklahoma Resource Basins, which will support two rigs and lease retention in the STACK and delineation of the SCOOP Springer and Meramec. Our drilling plans for the Oklahoma Resource Basins in 2016 call for drilling and completing 23 - 28 net wells (65 - 75 gross, of which 24 - 27 are company operated wells). We anticipate bringing 20 - 22 gross operated wells to sales during 2016. Bakken – We hold approximately 277,000 net acres in the Bakken shale oil play in North Dakota and eastern Montana, where we have been operating since 2006. We continue to see improvement in efficiency and well performance through optimizing completion techniques. We successfully completed a 55-well enhanced completion trial program that began in late 2014 and continued through 2015. We will continue executing and evaluating enhanced completion designs, including increased stage counts, high proppant volumes and fluid types as opportunities arise in 2016. Our large scale water gathering system is currently handling over 50% of our produced water. With a second phase expected to be fully operational in the second half of 2016, we anticipate this system will manage 80% of produced water by year end. Our time to drill a well averaged 15 days spud-to-TD in 2015 compared to 17 days in 2014. We recompleted 11 wells during 2015. In efforts to optimize price realizations, we sell our production in local North Dakota markets and to select purchasers who may elect to transport outside the state.Approximately 13% of our 2016 Capital Program, $193 million, is allocated to the Bakken, which will support one rig in 2016. Our 2016 Bakken program includes plans to drill 10 - 12 net wells (45 - 55 gross, of which we will operate 8 - 10). We anticipate bringing 13 - 15 gross operated wells to sales during 2016.Other North America During 2015, we further emphasized our focus on the U.S. unconventional resource plays, continued to maximize cash generation from our conventional assets and continued to dispose of non-core assets. In August 2015, we closed the sale of our East Texas, North Louisiana and Wilburton, Oklahoma natural gas assets. In December 2015, we closed the sale of our operated producing properties in the greater Ewing Bank area and non-operated producing interests in the Petronius field in the Gulf of Mexico. In February 2016, we closed the sale of our non-operated producing interests in the Neptune field in the Gulf of Mexico. These assets collectively produced approximately 14 mboed in 2015. Other North America consists primarily of onshore production operations in Wyoming and development activities in the Gulf of Mexico. In the Gulf, development work continues in the Gunflint field located on Mississippi Canyon Blocks 948, 949, 992 (N/2) and 993 (N/2). The development wells were completed in 2015. First oil is expected in mid-2016 after the completion of work at the third-party Gulfstar 1 host facility. We hold an 18% non-operated working interest in the Gunflint field.A deepwater oil discovery on the Shenandoah prospect, located on Walker Ridge Block 51, was drilled in 2009. We own a 10% non-operated working interest in this prospect. The first appraisal well on the Shenandoah prospect reached total depth in 2013 and was successful. The operator drilled a second appraisal well in 2014, which was unsuccessful. A third appraisal well was spud in 2015, and was successfully sidetracked, logged and cored, finding more than 620 feet of net oil pay. A fourth appraisal well is expected to be spud in the first quarter of 2016. Wyoming - We have ongoing waterflood and enhanced oil recovery projects in the mature Big Horn and Wind River Basins. Marathon is the third largest oil producer in the state of Wyoming. We also have conventional natural gas operations in the Greater Green River Basin. Our Wyoming net sales averaged 17 mbbld of liquid hydrocarbons and 4 mmcfd of natural gas, or 17 mboed, during 2015 compared to 18 mboed in 2014. In addition, Marathon owns the 420-mile Red Butte Pipeline which connects oil fields in the Big Horn Basin to both the Silvertip Station on the Montana/Wyoming state line and to alternate outlets in Casper, Wyoming. 8North America E&P--Exploration In September 2015, we announced our intention to scale back our conventional exploration program. Our 2016 Capital Program includes $15 million for conventional exploration. No conventional exploration wells are planned in 2016. Our Capital Program is limited to existing commitments in the Gulf of Mexico. We continue to evaluate options for utilization of our remaining commitments on the Maersk Valiant drillship. The rig is currently being operated by our rig share partner, and we anticipate the rig to be available for our use in early 2017. The Solomon exploration prospect located on Walker Ridge Block 225 was spud during the second quarter of 2015 and reached total depth in the fourth quarter. The well did encounter the lower tertiary target interval. The well was plugged and abandoned, with well costs charged to dry well expense, and the rig was released with no further activity planned on the block. We hold a 58% operated working interest in this prospect. We hold interests in both operated and non-operated exploration stage oil sand leases in Alberta, Canada, which could be developed using in-situ methods of extraction. These leases cover approximately 142,000 gross (54,000 net) acres in four project areas: Namur, in which we hold a 70% operated interest; Birchwood, in which we hold a 100% operated interest; Ells River, in which we hold a 20% non-operated interest; and Saleski in which we hold a 33% non-operated interest. During 2015, in connection with our decision to scale back our conventional exploration program, and also after further evaluation of the estimated recoverable resources and our development plans at Birchwood, Ells River and Namur, we impaired the remaining net book values of these in-situ properties. International E&P Segment We are engaged in oil and gas exploration, development and/or production activities in E.G., Gabon, the Kurdistan Region of Iraq, Libya and the U.K. We include the results of our natural gas liquefaction operations and methanol production operations in E.G. in our International E&P segment. The following table provides net sales volumes for our significant operational areas within this segment:Net Sales Volumes2015 Increase(Decrease) 2014 Increase(Decrease) 2013Equivalent Barrels (mboed)          Equatorial Guinea97 (7)% 104 (3)% 107 United Kingdom (a)19 19 % 16 (20)% 20 Libya— (100)% 7 (75)% 28 Total International E&P (mboed)116 (9)% 127 (18)% 155Net Sales Volumes of Equity Method Investees          LNG (mtd)5,884 (10)% 6,535 — % 6,548 Methanol (mtd)937 (14)% 1,092 (13)% 1,249(a)  Includes natural gas acquired for injection and subsequent resale of 8 mmcfd, 6 mmcfd and 7 mmcfd for 2015, 2014, and 2013.AfricaEquatorial Guinea – Production – We own a 63% operated working interest under a PSC in the Alba field which is offshore E.G. Operational availability from our company-operated facilities averaged approximately 97% in 2015. In the third quarter of 2015, production was increased as the Alba C21 development well came online with higher than expected liquid yields, in combination with a successful well intervention program on five existing Alba wells. In January 2016, we completed the installation of an offshore compression platform which is expected to start up mid-2016 following completion of hookup and commissioning activities. The compression project was designed to maintain the production plateau two additional years and extend field life up to eight years. Equatorial Guinea – Gas Processing – We own a 52% interest in Alba Plant LLC, an equity method investee, that operates an onshore LPG processing plant located on Bioko Island. Alba field natural gas is processed by the LPG plant. Under a long-term contract at a fixed price per btu, the LPG plant extracts secondary condensate and LPG from the natural gas stream and uses some of the remaining dry natural gas in its operations. We also own 60% of EGHoldings and 45% of AMPCO, both of which are accounted for as equity method investments. EGHoldings operates an LNG production facility and AMPCO operates a methanol plant, both located on Bioko Island. These facilities allow us to monetize natural gas reserves from the Alba field. EGHoldings' 3.7 mmta LNG production facility sells LNG under a 3.4 mmta, or 460 mmcfd, sales and purchase agreement through 2023. The purchaser under the agreement takes delivery of the LNG on Bioko Island, with pricing linked principally to the Henry Hub index. Gross sales of LNG from this production facility totaled 3.6 mmta in 2015. 9AMPCO had gross sales totaling 760 mt in 2015. Production from the plant is used to supply customers in Europe and the U.S. Libya – We hold a 16% non-operated working interest in the Waha concessions, which encompass almost 13 million gross acres located in the Sirte Basin of eastern Libya, where civil and political unrest continues to interrupt our production operations. Operations were interrupted in mid-2013 as a result of the shutdown of the Es Sider crude oil terminal, and although temporarily re-opened during the second half of 2014, production remains shut-in through early 2016. Considerable uncertainty remains around the timing of future production and sales levels. We and our partners in the Waha concessions continue to assess the situation and the condition of our assets in Libya. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about our Libya operations.Other InternationalUnited Kingdom – Our largest asset in the U.K. sector of the North Sea is the Brae area complex where we are the operator and have a 42% working interest in the South, Central, North and West Brae fields and a 39% working interest in the East Brae field. The Brae Alpha platform and facilities host the South, Central and West Brae fields. The North Brae and East Brae fields are natural gas condensate fields which are produced via the Brae Bravo and the East Brae platforms, respectively. The East Brae platform also hosts the nearby Braemar field in which we have a 28% working interest. During the second quarter of 2015, we completed the final three wells of a five-well Brae infill drilling program that began in 2014. The strategic location of the Brae platforms, along with pipeline and onshore infrastructure, has generated third-party processing and transportation business since 1986. Currently, the operators of 31 third-party fields are contracted to use the Brae system and 72 mboed are being processed or transported through the Brae infrastructure. In addition to generating processing and pipeline tariff revenue, this third-party business optimizes infrastructure usage.The working interest owners of the Brae area producing assets collectively own a 50% non-operated interest in the SAGE system. The SAGE pipeline transports natural gas from the Brae area, and the third-party Beryl area, and has a total wet natural gas capacity of 1.1 bcf per day. The SAGE terminal at St. Fergus in northeast Scotland processes natural gas from the SAGE pipeline as well as approximately 0.3 bcf per day of third-party natural gas.We own non-operated working interests in the Foinaven area complex, consisting of a 28% working interest in the main Foinaven field, a 47% working interest in East Foinaven and a 20% working interest in the T35 and T25 fields. The export of Foinaven liquid hydrocarbons is via shuttle tanker from an FPSO to market. All natural gas sales are to the non-operated Magnus platform for use as injection gas. Kurdistan Region of Iraq – In aggregate, we have approximately 109,000 net acres in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. We have a 45% operated working interest in the Harir block located northeast of Erbil. We also have non-operated interests in two blocks located north-northwest of Erbil: Atrush with 15% working interest and Sarsang with 20% working interest. On the non-operated Atrush block, following the successful appraisal program and a declaration of commerciality, the Kurdistan Ministry of Natural Resources approved a plan for field development in September 2013. The development project consists of drilling four production wells and constructing a central processing facility in Phase 1 which provides for a 25-year production period. We expect first production in late 2016 with estimated initial gross production of approximately 30 mbbld of oil. Subject to further drilling and testing results, and partner and government approvals, a potential Phase 2 development could add an additional gross 30 mbbld facility. On the non-operated Sarsang block, the Swara Tika discovery was declared commercial in May 2014 and a field development plan was filed in June 2014. The plan was approved by the Kurdistan Ministry of Natural Resources in the fourth quarter of 2015. The first producing well came online in 2014 and the second producing well came online in December 2015. In 2016, an additional well is planned to come on-line. As the development plan progresses, we expect to increase production after 2016.  International E&P ExplorationIn September 2015, we announced our intention to scale back our conventional exploration program. Our 2016 Capital Program includes $16 million for conventional exploration. No conventional exploration wells are planned in 2016. Our Capital Program is limited to existing commitments in Gabon. Equatorial Guinea – Exploration – We hold a 63% operated working interest in the Deep Luba discovery on the Alba Block and an 80% operated working interest in the Corona well on Block D. We plan to develop Block D through a unitization with the Alba field. Negotiations have been substantially completed and approval is expected in 2016. We also have an 80% operated working interest in exploratory Block A-12 offshore Bioko Island, located immediately west of our operated Alba Field. 10Gabon – Exploration – We hold a 21.25% non-operated working interest in the Diaba License G4-223 and its related permit offshore Gabon, which covers approximately 2.2 million gross (477,000 net) acres. Multiple additional pre-salt prospects have been identified on this License. In August 2014, we signed an exploration and production sharing contract for Gabon offshore Block G13, which was subsequently re-named Tchicuate. The block, which is located in the pre-salt play offshore Gabon, encompasses 277,000 acres. The seismic program was completed during 2015 and processing will occur through 2016. We hold a 100% participating interest and operatorship in the block. In the event of development, the Republic of Gabon will assume a 20% financed interest in the contract upon commencement of production. The State holds additional rights to participate in the block in the future as a co-investor. Kurdistan Region of Iraq – During 2015, in connection with our decision to scale back our conventional exploration program, we impaired our investment in the operated Harir block. International E&P DispositionIn the third quarter of 2015, we entered into an agreement to sell our East Africa exploration acreage in Ethiopia and Kenya. The Kenya transaction closed in February 2016 and the Ethiopia transaction is expected to close during the first quarter of 2016. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about this disposition.Oil Sands Mining SegmentWe hold a 20% non-operated interest in the AOSP, an oil sands mining and upgrading joint venture located in Alberta, Canada. Other JV partners include Shell Canada Limited with a 60% ownership interest and Chevron Canada Limited with a 20% ownership interest. Shell Canada Limited operates the joint venture, which produces bitumen from oil sands deposits in the Athabasca region utilizing mining techniques and upgrades the bitumen into synthetic crude oils and vacuum gas oil. The AOSP’s mining and extraction assets are located near Fort McMurray, Alberta, and include the Muskeg River and the Jackpine mines. Gross design capacity of the combined mines is 255,000 (51,000 net) barrels of bitumen per day. The AOSP operations use established processes to mine oil sands deposits from an open-pit mine, extract the bitumen and upgrade it into synthetic crude oils. Ore is mined using traditional truck and shovel mining techniques. The mined ore passes through a series of primary crushers and rotary breakers for particle size reduction. The particles are combined with hot water to create slurry. The slurry is hydro-transported to a primary separation vessel where it separates into sand, clay and bitumen-rich froth. A solvent is added to the bitumen froth to separate out the remaining solids, water and heavy asphaltenes. The solvent washes the sand and produces clean bitumen that is required for the upgrader to run efficiently. The process yields a mixture of solvent and bitumen which is then transported from the mine to the Scotford upgrader via the approximately 300-mile Corridor Pipeline. The AOSP's Scotford upgrader is located at Fort Saskatchewan, northeast of Edmonton, Alberta. The bitumen is upgraded at Scotford using both hydrotreating and hydroconversion processes to remove sulfur and break the heavy bitumen molecules into lighter products. Blendstocks acquired from outside sources are utilized in the production of our saleable products. The upgrader produces synthetic crude oils and vacuum gas oil. The vacuum gas oil is sold to an affiliate of the operator under a long-term contract at market-related prices and the other products are sold in the marketplace.As of December 31, 2015, we own or have rights to participate in developed and undeveloped surface mineable leases totaling approximately 159,000 gross (32,000 net) acres. The underlying developed leases are held for the duration of the project, with royalties payable to the province of Alberta. Synthetic crude oil sales volumes for 2015 averaged 53 mbbld and net-of-royalty production was 45 mbbld. The operating cost structure of our Oil Sands Mining operations is predominantly fixed and therefore many of the costs incurred in times of full operation continue during production downtime. Per-unit costs are sensitive to production rates. As average price realizations are typically at a discount to WTI, the fixed operating cost structure for Oil Sands Mining will not fully track the price realization. Significant cost improvement efforts were employed in 2015 resulting in a material reduction to the production cost structure. See Item 7. Consolidated Results of Operations: 2015 compared to 2014 for additional detail on production expenses.The governments of Alberta and Canada agreed to partially fund Quest CCS. Construction began in 2012 and was completed in February 2015. Government funding commenced in 2012 and continued as milestones were achieved during the development, construction and operating phases of the project. Quest CCS was successfully completed and commissioned in the fourth quarter of 2015.11Productive and Drilling WellsFor our North America E&P and International E&P segments, the following table sets forth gross and net productive wells and service wells as of December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 and drilling wells as of December 31, 2015.

In the case of undeveloped properties, an investigation of record title is made at the time of acquisition. Drilling title opinions are usually prepared before commencement of drilling operations. Our title to properties may be subject to burdens such as royalty, overriding royalty, carried, net profits, working and other similar interests and contractual arrangements customary in the industry. In addition, our interests may be subject to obligations or duties under applicable laws or burdens such as net profits interests, liens related to operating agreements, development obligations or capital commitments under international PSCs or exploration licenses.The following table sets forth, by geographic area, the gross and net developed and undeveloped acreage held in our North America E&P and International E&P segments as of December 31, 2015.

If production is not established or we take no other action to extend the terms of the leases, licenses or concessions, undeveloped acreage listed in the table below will expire over the next three years. We plan to continue the terms of certain of these licenses and concession areas or retain leases through operational or administrative actions; however, the majority of the undeveloped acres associated with Other Africa as listed in the table below pertains to our licenses in Ethiopia and Kenya, for which we executed agreements in 2015 to sell. The Kenya transaction closed in February 2016 and the Ethiopia transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2016. See Item 8.

A geographic area can be an individual country, group of countries within a continent or a continent. Other International ("Other Int’l"), includes the U.K. and the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. We closed the sale of our East Texas/North Louisiana/Wilburton assets in the third quarter of 2015 and part of our Gulf of Mexico business in the fourth quarter of 2015. Additionally, we closed the sale of our Angola assets and our Norway business in 2014, and both are represented as discontinued operations ("Disc Ops") for periods presented. Approximately 77% of our proved reserves are located in OECD countries.Our December 31, 2015 proved reserves were calculated using the unweighted average of closing prices nearest to the first day of each month within the 12-month period ("SEC pricing"). The table below provides the 2015 SEC pricing of benchmark prices as well as the unweighted average for the first two months of 2016: SEC Pricing 2015 2-month Average 2016WTI Crude oil$50.28$34.19Henry Hub natural gas$2.59$2.28Brent crude oil$54.25$34.86Natural gas liquids$17.32$12.87When determining the December 31, 2015 proved reserves for each property, the 2015 SEC prices listed above were adjusted using price differentials that account for property-specific quality and location differences. Beginning in the second half of 2014, the crude oil and natural gas benchmarks began to decline and these declines continued through 2015 and into 2016. Commodity prices are likely to remain volatile based on global supply and demand and could decline further. Sustained reduced commodity prices could have a material effect on the quantity and future cash flows of our proved reserves. Estimates of future cash flows associated with proved reserves are based on actual costs of developing and producing the reserves as of the end of the year. The decline in commodity prices prompted a concerted effort to reduce the costs of developing and producing reserves. Therefore, the impact of sustained reduced commodity prices on future cash flows will be partially offset by the resulting lower costs to develop and produce reserves.A sustained period of lower commodity prices could also result in additional decreases to our near term capital program and deferrals of investment until prices improve. A shifting of capital expenditures into future periods beyond five years from the initial proved reserve booking could potentially lead to a reduction in proved undeveloped reserves. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for a further discussion of how a substantial extended decline in commodity prices could impact us. As of December 31, 2015, total proved reserves declined 35 mmboe, primarily due to negative revisions in the U.S. totaling 173 mmboe largely a result of reductions to our capital development program which deferred proved undeveloped reserves beyond the 5-year plan, as well as routine production. This decline was partially offset by increased reserves from the drilling programs in our U.S. unconventional shale plays totaling 246 mmboe as well as a positive revision of 67 mmboe in OSM. The OSM revision was a consequence of technical reevaluation and lower royalty percentages due to lower realized prices. Royalties paid in Canada are on a sliding scale; as the sales price of our synthetic crude oil decreases, our royalty rate decreases. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Supplementary Information on Oil and Gas Producing Activities for more information. 15The following tables set forth estimated quantities of our proved crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserves based upon an SEC pricing for periods ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.

Crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserve estimates are reviewed and approved by our Corporate Reserves Group, which includes our Director of Corporate Reserves and his staff of Reserve Coordinators. Crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas reserve estimates are developed or reviewed by Qualified Reserves Estimators ("QREs"). QREs are engineers or geoscientists who hold at least a Bachelor of Science degree in the appropriate technical field, have a minimum of three years of industry experience with at least one year in reserve estimation and have completed Marathon Oil's QRE training course. All QREs must complete a QRE refresher course at least once every three years. Our Corporate Reserves group screens all fields with net proved reserves of 20 mmboe or greater, every year, to determine if a field review is required. Any change to proved reserve estimates in excess of 1 mmboe on a total field basis, within a single month, must be approved by a Reserve Coordinator.Our Director of Corporate Reserves, who reports to our Vice President, Technology and Innovation, has a Bachelor of Science degree in petroleum engineering and is a registered Professional Engineer in the State of Texas. In his 28 years with Marathon Oil, he has held numerous engineering and management positions, including managing our OSM segment. He is a member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers ("SPE") and a former member of the Petroleum Engineering Advisory Council for the University of Texas at Austin.Estimates of synthetic crude oil reserves are prepared by GLJ Petroleum Consultants ("GLJ") of Calgary, Alberta, Canada, third-party consultants. Their reports for all years are filed as exhibits to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The individual responsible for the estimates of our synthetic crude oil reserves has 15 years of experience in petroleum engineering, has conducted surface mineable oil sands evaluations since 2009 and is a registered Practicing Professional Engineer in the Province of Alberta. Audits of EstimatesWe engage third-party consultants to provide, at a minimum, independent estimates for fields that comprise 80% of our total proved reserves over a rolling four-year period. We exceeded this percentage for the four-year period ended December 31, 2015, with 82% of our total proved reserves independently audited. We have established a tolerance level of +/- 10% such that initial estimates by the third-party consultants for each field are accepted if they are within 10% of our internal estimates. Should the third-party consultants’ initial analysis fail to reach our tolerance level, both parties re-examine the information provided, request additional data and refine their analysis, if appropriate. In the very limited instances where differences outside the 10% tolerance cannot be resolved by year end, a plan to resolve the difference is developed and executive management consent is obtained. The audit process did not result in any significant changes to our reserve estimates for 2015, 2014 or 2013. 17During 2015, 2014 and 2013, Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc. ("NSAI") prepared a certification of the prior year's reserves for the Alba field in E.G. The NSAI summary reports are filed as an exhibit to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Members of the NSAI team have multiple years of industry experience, having worked for large, international oil and gas companies before joining NSAI. The senior technical advisor has over 35 years of practical experience in petroleum geosciences, with over 15 years experience in the estimation and evaluation of reserves. The second team member has over 10 years of practical experience in petroleum engineering, with over five years experience in the estimation and evaluation of reserves. Both are registered Professional Engineers in the State of Texas.Ryder Scott Company ("Ryder Scott") also performed audits of the prior years' reserves of several of our fields in 2015, 2014 and 2013. Their summary reports are filed as exhibits to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The team lead for Ryder Scott has over 20 years of industry experience, having worked for a major international oil and gas company before joining Ryder Scott. He is a member of SPE, where he served on the Oil and Gas Reserves Committee, and is a registered Professional Engineer in the State of Texas.Changes in Proved Undeveloped ReservesAs of December 31, 2015, 603 mmboe of proved undeveloped reserves were reported, a decrease of 125 mmboe from December 31, 2014. The following table shows changes in total proved undeveloped reserves for 2015:(mmboe) Beginning of year728Revisions of previous estimates(223)Improved recovery1Purchases of reserves in place1Extensions, discoveries, and other additions175Dispositions—Transfers to proved developed(79)End of year603The revisions to previous estimates were largely due to a result of reductions to our capital development program which deferred proved undeveloped reserves beyond the 5-year plan. A total of 139 mmboe was booked as extensions, discoveries or other additions and revisions due to the application of reliable technology. Technologies included statistical analysis of production performance, decline curve analysis, pressure and rate transient analysis, reservoir simulation and volumetric analysis. The observed statistical nature of production performance coupled with highly certain reservoir continuity or quality within the reliable technology areas and sufficient proved developed locations establish the reasonable certainty criteria required for booking proved reserves.Transfers from proved undeveloped to proved developed reserves included 47 mmboe in the Eagle Ford, 14 mmboe in the Bakken and 5 mmboe in the Oklahoma Resource Basins due to development drilling and completions. Costs incurred in 2015, 2014 and 2013 relating to the development of proved undeveloped reserves were $1,415 million, $3,149 million and $2,536 million. Projects can remain in proved undeveloped reserves for extended periods in certain situations such as large development projects which take more than five years to complete, or the timing of when additional gas compression is needed. Of the 603 mmboe of proved undeveloped reserves at December 31, 2015, 26% of the volume is associated with projects that have been included in proved reserves for more than five years. The majority of this volume is related to a compression project in E.G. that was sanctioned by our Board of Directors in 2004. During 2012, the compression project received the approval of the E.G. government, fabrication of the new platform began in 2013 and installation of the platform at the Alba Field occurred in January 2016. Commissioning is currently underway, with first production expected by mid-2016. Proved undeveloped reserves for the North Gialo development, located in the Libyan Sahara desert, were booked for the first time in 2010. This development is being executed by the operator and encompasses a multi-year drilling program including the design, fabrication and installation of extensive liquid handling and gas recycling facilities. Anecdotal evidence from similar development projects in the region leads to an expected project execution time frame of more than five years from the time the reserves were initially booked. Interruptions associated with the civil and political unrest have also extended the project duration. Operations were interrupted in mid-2013 as a result of the shutdown of the Es Sider crude oil terminal, and although temporarily re-opened during the second half of 2014, production remains shut-in through early 2016. The operator is committed to the project’s completion and continues to assign resources in order to execute the project.Our conversion rate for proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves for 2015 was 11%. However, excluding the aforementioned long-term projects in E.G. and Libya, our 2015 conversion rate would be 15%. Furthermore, our 185-year annual conversion rate (2011-2015) averaged 21% and would be 32%, excluding the long-term projects in E.G. and Libya.All proved undeveloped reserve drilling locations are scheduled to be drilled prior to the end of 2020. As of December 31, 2015, future development costs estimated to be required for the development of proved undeveloped crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserves for the years 2016 through 2020 are projected to be $630 million, $859 million, $1,389 million, $1,764 million and $986 million.

See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Supplementary Information on Oil and Gas Producing Activities - Results of Operations for Oil and Gas Production Activities for more information regarding production costs.N.M.Not meaningful information due to limited sales. Marketing and Midstream Our reportable operating segments include activities related to the marketing and transportation of substantially all of our liquid hydrocarbon, synthetic crude oil and natural gas production. These activities include the transportation of production to market centers, the sale of commodities to third parties and the storage of production. We balance our various sales, storage and transportation positions in order to aggregate volumes to satisfy transportation commitments and to achieve flexibility within product types and delivery points. Such activities can include the purchase of commodities from third parties for resale.As discussed previously, we currently own and operate gathering systems and other midstream assets in some of our production areas. We continue to evaluate midstream infrastructure investments in connection with our development plans. Delivery CommitmentsWe have committed to deliver quantities of crude oil and synthetic crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas to customers under a variety of contracts. As of December 31, 2015, those contracts for fixed and determinable quantities were at variable, market-based pricing and related primarily to liquid hydrocarbon production in the Eagle Ford and Bakken, and OSM synthetic crude oil production. Eagle Ford liquid hydrocarbon production sales commitments range from a minimum of 128 mbbld in 2016, decreasing to 51 mbbld through 2020. Bakken liquid hydrocarbon production sales commitments range from 10 mbbld to 30 mbbld from 2016 through 2026. Synthetic crude oil production sales commitments are 14 mbbld in 2016 and 10 mbbld in 2017. Eagle Ford natural gas production sales commitments range from a minimum of 210 mmbtu in 2016, decreasing to 46 mmbtu through 2022. Our current production rates, forecasts and proved reserves are sufficient to meet these commitments. All of these contracts provide the options of delivering third-party volumes or paying a monetary shortfall penalty if production is inadequate. Certain volumetric requirements can also be met through purchases of third-party volumes.In addition to the sales contracts discussed above, we have entered into numerous agreements for transportation and processing of our equity production. Some of these contracts have volumetric requirements which could require monetary shortfall penalties if our production is inadequate to meet the terms.Competition and Market ConditionsCompetition exists in all sectors of the oil and gas industry and, in particular, in the exploration for and development of new reserves. We compete with major integrated and independent oil and gas companies, as well as national oil companies, for the acquisition of oil and natural gas leases and other properties. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for discussion of specific areas in which we compete and related risks.We also compete with other producers of synthetic crude oil for the sale of our synthetic crude oil to refineries primarily in North America. Because not all refineries are able to process or refine synthetic crude oil in significant volumes, sufficient market demand may not exist at all times to absorb our share of the synthetic crude oil production from the AOSP at economically viable prices. Our operating results are affected by price changes for liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas, as well as changes in competitive conditions in the markets we serve. Generally, results from oil and gas production and OSM operations benefit from higher liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas prices. Market conditions in the oil and gas industry are cyclical and subject to global economic and political events and new and changing governmental regulations. See Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Overview – Market Conditions for additional discussion of the impact of prices on our operations.20Environmental, Health and Safety MattersThe Health, Environmental, Safety and Corporate Responsibility Committee of our Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing our position on public issues, including environmental, health and safety matters. Our Corporate Health, Environment, Safety and Security organization has the responsibility to ensure that our operating organizations maintain environmental compliance systems that support and foster our compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Committees comprised of certain of our officers review our overall performance associated with various environmental compliance programs. We also have a Corporate Emergency Response Team which oversees our response to any major environmental or other emergency incident involving us or any of our properties. Our businesses are subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, health and safety at the national, state and local levels. Major U.S. federal statutes include, but are not limited to, the Occupational Safety and Health Act ("OSHA") with respect to the protection of the health and safety of employees, the Clean Air Act ("CAA") with respect to air emissions, the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (also known as the Clean Water Act ("CWA")) with respect to water discharges, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act ("CERCLA") with respect to releases and remediation of hazardous substances, the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 ("OPA-90") with respect to oil pollution and response, the National Environmental Policy Act with respect to evaluation of environmental impacts, the Endangered Species Act with respect to the protection of endangered or threatened species, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act ("RCRA") with respect to solid and hazardous waste treatment, storage and disposal and the U.S. Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act with respect to the dissemination of information relating to certain chemical inventories. Other countries in which we operate have their own laws dealing with similar matters. These laws and their implementing regulations and other similar state and local laws and rules can impose certain operational controls for minimization of pollution, recordkeeping, monitoring and reporting requirements or other operational or siting constraints on our business, result in costs to remediate releases of regulated substances, including crude oil, into the environment, or require costs to remediate sites to which we sent regulated substances for disposal. In some cases, these laws can impose strict liability for the entire cost of clean-up on any responsible party without regard to negligence or fault and impose liability on us for the conduct of others (such as prior owners or operators of our assets) or conditions others have caused, or for our acts that complied with all applicable requirements when we performed them. We have incurred and will continue to incur capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations. We believe that substantially all of our competitors must comply with similar environmental laws and regulations. However, the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of its operating facilities, marketing areas and production processes. New laws have been enacted and regulations are being adopted by various regulatory agencies on a continuing basis and the costs of compliance with these new laws and regulations can only be broadly appraised until their implementation becomes more defined.For a discussion of environmental capital expenditures and costs of compliance for air, water, solid waste and remediation, see Item 3. Legal Proceedings and Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Environmental Matters, Litigation and Contingencies.Air and Climate ChangeThe EPA finalized a more stringent National Ambient Air Quality Standard ("NAAQS") for ozone in October 2015. This more stringent ozone NAAQS could result in additional areas being designated as non-attainment, including areas in which we operate, which may result in an increase in costs for emission controls and requirements for additional monitoring and testing, as well as a more cumbersome permitting process. Although there may be an adverse financial impact (including compliance costs, potential permitting delays and increased regulatory requirements) associated with this revised regulation, the extent and magnitude of that impact cannot be reliably or accurately estimated due to the present uncertainty regarding any additional measures and how they will be implemented. The EPA's final rule has been judicially challenged by both industry and other interested parties, and the outcome of this litigation may also impact implementation and revisions to the rule.In September 2015, the EPA published a suite of proposed rules specifically targeting methane emissions from the oil and gas industry, aggregation of air emissions sources and minor source permitting for operations on tribal lands. These rules are expected to be finalized in 2016. If we are unable to comply with the final terms of these regulations, we could be required to forego construction, modification or certain operations. These regulations may also increase compliance costs for some facilities we own or operate, and result in administrative, civil and/or criminal penalties for non-compliance.21In 2010, the EPA promulgated rules that require us to monitor and submit an annual report on our greenhouse gas emissions. Further, state, national and international requirements to reduce greenhouse emissions are being proposed and in some cases promulgated (see discussion above regarding proposed regulation of methane emissions from the oil and gas industry by the EPA). Potential legislation and regulations pertaining to climate change could also affect our operations. The cost to comply with these laws and regulations cannot be estimated at this time. In January 2016, the Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”) proposed a rule to further restrict venting and/or flaring of gas from facilities subject to BLM jurisdiction, and to modify certain royalty requirements. If the rule is finalized as proposed, it could result in additional costs of compliance as well as increased monitoring, recordkeeping and recording for some of our facilities. If we are unable to comply with the final terms of these regulations, we could be required to forego certain operations. These regulations may also result in administrative, civil and/or criminal penalties for non-compliance.For additional information, see Item 1A. Risk Factors. As part of our commitment to environmental stewardship, we estimate and publicly report greenhouse gas emissions from our operations. We are working to continuously improve the accuracy and completeness of these estimates. In addition, we continuously strive to improve operational and energy efficiencies through resource and energy conservation where practicable and cost effective.Hydraulic FracturingHydraulic fracturing is a commonly used process that involves injecting water, sand and small volumes of chemicals into the wellbore to fracture the hydrocarbon-bearing rock thousands of feet below the surface to facilitate higher flow of hydrocarbons into the wellbore. Our business uses this technique extensively throughout our operations. Hydraulic fracturing has been regulated at the state and local level through permitting and compliance requirements. Federal, state and local-level laws or regulations targeting various aspects of the hydraulic fracturing process are being considered, or have been proposed or implemented. For example, the U.S. Congress has considered legislation that would require additional regulation affecting the hydraulic fracturing process, and may be expected to do so in future legislative sessions. Further, various state and local-level initiatives in regions with substantial shale resources have been or may be proposed or implemented to further regulate hydraulic fracturing practices, limit water withdrawals and water use, require disclosure of fracturing fluid constituents, restrict which additives may be used, or implement temporary or permanent bans on hydraulic fracturing. In addition to such legislative and regulatory proposals, there are also a number of studies and initiatives underway that may lead to additional proposals in the future, such as the EPA research study on the potential effects that hydraulic fracturing may have on water quality and public health. In 2015 the BLM issued a rule governing certain hydraulic fracturing practices on lands within their jurisdiction. While this rule has been stayed nationwide by court ruling, further findings by the court could result in additional changes to this new rule. Increased regulation and attention given to the hydraulic fracturing process could lead to greater opposition, including litigation, to oil and gas activities using hydraulic fracturing techniques. Additional legislation or regulation could also lead to operational delays or increased operating costs in the production of crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas, including from the shale plays, or could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing. The adoption of any federal, state or local laws or the implementation of regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing could potentially cause a decrease in the completion of new oil and gas wells and increased compliance costs which could increase costs of our operations and cause considerable delays in acquiring regulatory approvals to drill and complete wells.State and federal regulatory agencies recently have focused on a possible connection between the operation of injection wells used for oil and gas waste disposal and seismic activity. Similar concerns have been raised that hydraulic fracturing may also contribute to seismic activity. When caused by human activity, such events are called induced seismicity. In a few instances, operators of injection wells in the vicinity of seismic events have been ordered to reduce injection volumes or suspend operations. A 2012 report published by the National Academy of Sciences concluded that only a very small fraction of the tens of thousands of injection wells have been suspected to be, or have been, the likely cause of induced seismicity; and a 2015 report by researchers at the University of Texas has suggested that the link between seismic activity and wastewater disposal may vary by region. Some state regulatory agencies have modified their regulations to account for induced seismicity. Regulatory agencies at all levels are continuing to study the possible linkage between oil and gas activity and induced seismicity. In addition, a number of lawsuits have been filed including recent negligence suits and a RCRA citizen suit in Oklahoma alleging that disposal well operations have caused damage to neighboring properties or otherwise violated state and federal rules regulating waste disposal. These developments could result in additional regulation and restrictions on the use of injection wells and hydraulic fracturing. Increased regulation and attention given to induced seismicity could lead to greater opposition, including litigation, to oil and gas activities utilizing hydraulic fracturing or injection wells for waste disposal. Additional legislation or regulation could also lead to operational delays or increased operating costs in the production of crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas, including from the shale plays, or could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing. The adoption of any federal, state or local laws or the implementation of regulations regarding induced seismicity 22could potentially cause a decrease in the completion of new oil and gas wells and increased compliance costs which could increase costs of our operations and cause considerable delays in acquiring regulatory approvals to drill and complete wells.TransportationA number of state and federal rules apply to the transportation of liquid hydrocarbons. In 2014, the U.S. Department of Transportation (“DOT”) finalized a rule relating to testing and classification of liquid hydrocarbons and imposing additional restrictions on the types of rail cars that may be used in certain types of liquid hydrocarbon service. Although our businesses do not own rail cars and purchasers of our liquid hydrocarbons make arrangements for its transportation, such regulations could increase transportation costs which are passed on to Marathon Oil by liquid hydrocarbon purchasers. In addition, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, a sub-agency of DOT, has proposed or announced the intention to propose various rules related to pipeline transportation of natural gas and/or liquid hydrocarbons. Such regulations could increase the regulatory burden on our businesses where we own or operate pipelines or could otherwise increase costs to third parties that are passed on to Marathon Oil.WaterIn 2014, the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers published proposed regulations which expand the surface waters that are regulated under the Clean Water Act and its various programs. While these regulations were finalized largely as proposed in 2015, the rule has been stayed by the courts pending a substantive decision on the merits. If this rule is ultimately implemented, the expansion of CWA jurisdiction will result in additional costs of compliance as well as increased monitoring, recordkeeping and recording for some of our facilities.Concentrations of Credit RiskWe are exposed to credit risk in the event of nonpayment by counterparties, a significant portion of which are concentrated in energy-related industries. The creditworthiness of customers and other counterparties is subject to continuing review, including the use of master netting agreements, where appropriate. In 2015, sales to Irving Oil and Shell Oil and each of their respective affiliates accounted for approximately 13% and 11% of our total revenues. In 2014, sales to Shell Oil and its affiliates accounted for approximately 10% of our total revenues. In 2013, Statoil, the purchaser of the majority of our Libyan crude oil, accounted for approximately 10% of our total revenues.Trademarks, Patents and LicensesWe currently hold a number of U.S. and foreign patents and have various pending patent applications. Although in the aggregate our trademarks, patents and licenses are important to us, we do not regard any single trademark, patent, license or group of related trademarks, patents or licenses as critical or essential to our business as a whole.EmployeesWe had 2,611 active, full-time employees as of December 31, 2015. We consider labor relations with our employees to be satisfactory. We have not had any work stoppages or strikes pertaining to our employees.Executive Officers of the RegistrantThe executive officers of Marathon Oil and their ages as of February 1, 2016, are as follows:Lee M.

Risk FactorsWe are subject to various risks and uncertainties in the course of our business. The following summarizes significant risks and uncertainties that may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. When considering an investment in our securities, you should carefully consider the risk factors included below as well as those matters referenced in the foregoing pages under "Disclosures Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" and other information included and incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K.The recent substantial decline in liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas prices has reduced our operating results and cash flows and, if continued, could adversely impact our future rate of growth and the carrying value of our assets.Prices for crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and synthetic crude oil fluctuate widely. Our revenues, operating results and future rate of growth are highly dependent on the prices we receive for our crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and synthetic crude oil. Historically, the markets for crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and synthetic crude oil have been volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future. Beginning in the second half of 2014 and continuing into 2016, prices for WTI and Brent crude oil, Henry Hub natural gas and natural gas liquids have substantially declined. Furthermore, crude oil and natural gas futures prices indicate that these lower prices may persist for the foreseeable future. Many of the factors influencing prices of crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and synthetic crude oil are beyond our control. These factors include:•worldwide and domestic supplies of and demand for crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and synthetic crude oil;•the cost of exploring for, developing and producing crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and synthetic crude oil;•the ability of the members of OPEC to agree to and maintain production controls;•the level of drilling, completion and production activities by other exploration and production companies, and variability therein, in response to market conditions;•political instability or armed conflict in oil and natural gas producing regions;•changes in weather patterns and climate;•natural disasters such as hurricanes and tornadoes;•the price and availability of alternative and competing forms of energy;•the effect of conservation efforts;•epidemics or pandemics;•technological advances affecting energy consumption and energy supply;•domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes; and•general economic conditions worldwide.The long-term effects of these and other factors on the prices of crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and synthetic crude oil are uncertain. The recent substantial declines in commodity prices already have adversely affected our business by:•reducing the amount of crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and synthetic crude oil that we can produce economically;•reducing our revenues, operating income and cash flows;•causing us to reduce our capital expenditures, and delay or postpone some of our capital projects; •requiring us to impair the carrying value of our assets; •reducing the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and synthetic crude oil; and•increasing the costs of obtaining capital, such as equity and short- and long-term debt.A further prolonged extension of prices at these levels could extend or exacerbate these adverse effects. 25A substantial, extended decline in liquid hydrocarbon or natural gas prices could adversely affect the abilities of our counterparties to perform their obligations to us, including abandonment obligations, which could negatively impact our financial results. We often enter into arrangements to conduct certain business operations, such as oil and gas exploration and production, oil sands mining or liquid hydrocarbon or natural gas transportation, with partners and other counterparties in order to share risks associated with those operations. In addition, we market our products to a variety of purchasers. If commodity prices remain at or fall below current levels, some of our counterparties may experience liquidity problems and may not be able to meet their financial and other obligations, including abandonment obligations, to us. The inability of our joint venture partners to fund their portion of the costs under our joint venture agreements, or the nonperformance by purchasers, contractors or other counterparties of their obligations to us, could negatively impact our operating results and cash flows.Our offshore operations involve special risks that could negatively impact us.Offshore exploration and development operations present technological challenges and operating risks because of the marine environment. Activities in deepwater areas may pose incrementally greater risks because of water depths that limit intervention capability and the physical distance to oilfield service infrastructure and service providers. Environmental remediation and other costs resulting from spills or releases may result in substantial liabilities.Estimates of crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserves depend on many factors and assumptions, including various assumptions that are based on conditions in existence as of the dates of the estimates. Any material changes in those conditions or other factors affecting those assumptions could impair the quantity and value of our reserves.The proved reserve information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K has been derived from engineering and geoscience estimates. Estimates of liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves were prepared by our in-house teams of reservoir engineers and geoscience professionals and were reviewed and approved by our Corporate Reserves Group. The synthetic crude oil reserves estimates were prepared by GLJ, a third-party consulting firm experienced in working with oil sands. Reserves were valued based on SEC pricing for the periods ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, as well as other conditions in existence at those dates. The table below provides the 2015 SEC pricing for certain benchmark prices as well as the unweighted average for the first two months of 2016: SEC Pricing 2015 2-month Average 2016WTI Crude oil$50.28$34.19Henry Hub natural gas$2.59$2.28Brent crude oil$54.25$34.86Natural gas liquids$17.32$12.87Any significant future price change could have a material effect on the quantity and present value of our proved reserves. To the extent that commodity prices remain at current or lower levels throughout 2016, a portion of our proved reserves could be deemed uneconomic and no longer classified as proved. This could impact both proved developed producing reserves as well as proved undeveloped reserves. If prices remain at the 2-month average depicted above throughout 2016, a material volume of our proved reserves could become uneconomic and would have to be reclassified to non-proved reserve or resource category. Assuming lower SEC pricing in 2016, our OSM proved reserves represent the largest risk to be reclassified to non-proved reserve or resource category. However, any impact of lower SEC pricing will likely be partially offset by continued cost reduction efforts. Also, any volumes reclassified to non-proved reserves could return to proved reserves as commodity prices improve. Future reserve revisions could also result from changes in capital funding, drilling plans and governmental regulation, among other things. 26Reserve estimation is a subjective process that involves estimating volumes to be recovered from underground accumulations of crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and bitumen that cannot be directly measured. (Bitumen is mined and then upgraded into synthetic crude oil.) Estimates of economically producible reserves and of future net cash flows depend on a number of variable factors and assumptions, including:•location, size and shape of the accumulation as well as fluid, rock and producing characteristics of the accumulation;•historical production from the area, compared with production from other comparable producing areas;•volumes of bitumen in-place and various factors affecting the recoverability of bitumen and its conversion into synthetic crude oil such as historical upgrader performance;•the assumed effects of regulation by governmental agencies;•assumptions concerning future operating costs, severance and excise taxes, development costs and workover and repair costs; and•industry economic conditions, levels of cash flows from operations and other operating considerations.As a result, different petroleum engineers, each using industry-accepted geologic and engineering practices and scientific methods, may produce different estimates of proved reserves and future net cash flows based on the same available data. Because of the subjective nature of such reserve estimates, each of the following items may differ materially from the amounts or other factors estimated:•the amount and timing of production;•the revenues and costs associated with that production; and•the amount and timing of future development expenditures.The discounted future cash flows from our proved crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserves reflected in this Annual Report on Form 10-K should not be considered as the market value of the reserves attributable to our properties. As required by SEC Rule 4-10 of Regulation S-X, the estimated discounted future cash flows from our proved crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserves are based on an unweighted average of closing prices for the first day of each month in the 12-month periods ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, and costs applicable at the date of the estimate, while actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower. In addition, the 10% discount factor required by the applicable rules of the SEC to be used to calculate discounted future cash flows for reporting purposes is not necessarily the most appropriate discount factor based on our cost of capital and the risks associated with our business and the oil and natural gas industry in general.If we are unsuccessful in acquiring or finding additional reserves, our future liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas production would decline, thereby reducing our cash flows and results of operations and impairing our financial condition.The rate of production from liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas properties generally declines as reserves are depleted. Except to the extent we acquire interests in additional properties containing proved reserves, conduct successful exploration and development activities or, through engineering studies, optimize production performance or identify additional reservoirs not currently producing or secondary recovery reserves, our proved reserves will decline materially as crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and synthetic crude oil are produced. Accordingly, to the extent we are not successful in replacing the crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and synthetic crude oil we produce, our future revenues will decline. Creating and maintaining an inventory of prospects for future production depends on many factors, including:•obtaining rights to explore for, develop and produce crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and synthetic crude oil in promising areas;•drilling success;•the ability to complete long lead-time, capital-intensive projects timely and cost effectively;•the ability to find or acquire additional proved reserves at acceptable costs; and•the ability to fund such activity.27Future exploration and drilling results are uncertain and involve substantial costs.Drilling for crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas involves numerous risks, including the risk that we may not encounter commercially productive liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reservoirs. The costs of drilling, completing and operating wells are often uncertain, and drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors, including:•unexpected drilling conditions;•title problems;•pressure or irregularities in formations;•equipment failures or accidents;•fires, explosions, blowouts or surface cratering;•lack of access to pipelines or other transportation methods; and•shortages or delays in the availability of services or delivery of equipment.If we are unable to complete capital projects at their expected costs and in a timely manner, or if the market conditions assumed in our project economics deteriorate, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.Delays or cost increases related to capital spending programs involving engineering, procurement and construction of facilities (including improvements and repairs to our existing facilities) could adversely affect our ability to achieve forecasted internal rates of return and operating results. Delays in making required changes or upgrades to our facilities could subject us to fines or penalties as well as affect our ability to supply certain products we produce. Such delays or cost increases may arise as a result of unpredictable factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:•denial of or delay in receiving requisite regulatory approvals and/or permits;•unplanned increases in the cost of construction materials or labor;•disruptions in transportation of components or construction materials;•increased costs or operational delays resulting from shortages of water; •adverse weather conditions, natural disasters or other events (such as equipment malfunctions, explosions, fires or spills) affecting our facilities, or those of vendors or suppliers;•shortages of sufficiently skilled labor, or labor disagreements resulting in unplanned work stoppages;•market-related increases in a project’s debt or equity financing costs; and•nonperformance by, or disputes with, vendors, suppliers, contractors or subcontractors.Any one or more of these factors could have a significant impact on our capital projects.We may incur substantial capital expenditures and operating costs as a result of compliance with, and/or changes in environmental, health, safety and security laws and regulations, and, as a result, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.Our businesses are subject to numerous laws, regulations and other requirements relating to the protection of the environment, including those relating to the discharge of materials into the environment such as the venting or flaring of natural gas, waste management, pollution prevention, greenhouse gas emissions and the protection of endangered species as well as laws, regulations, and other requirements relating to public and employee safety and health and to facility security. We have incurred and may continue to incur capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures as a result of these laws, regulations, and other requirements. To the extent these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products, our operating results will be adversely affected. The specific impact of these laws, regulations, and other requirements may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of operating facilities and production processes. We may also be required to make material expenditures to modify operations, install pollution control equipment, perform site clean-ups or curtail operations that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We may become subject to liabilities that we currently do not anticipate in connection with new, amended or more stringent requirements, stricter interpretations of existing requirements or the future discovery of contamination. In addition, any failure by us to comply with existing or future laws, regulations, and other requirements could result in civil penalties or criminal fines and other enforcement actions against us. 28We believe it is likely that the scientific and political attention to issues concerning the extent, causes of and responsibility for climate change will continue, with the potential for further regulations that could affect our operations. Our operations result in greenhouse gas emissions. Currently, various legislative or regulatory measures to address greenhouse gas emissions (including carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxides) are in various phases of review, discussion or implementation in countries where we operate, including the U.S., Canada, and the European Union. Internationally, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change finalized an agreement among 195 nations at the 21st Conference of the Parties in Paris with an overarching goal of preventing global temperatures from rising more than 2 degrees Celsius. The agreement includes provisions that every country take some action to lower emissions, but there is no legal requirement for how or by what amount emissions should be lowered. The EPA has also proposed regulations targeting methane emissions from the oil and gas industry, which are expected to be finalized in 2016. Finalization of new legislation, regulations or international agreements in the future could result in increased costs to operate and maintain our facilities, capital expenditures to install new emission controls at our facilities, and costs to administer and manage any potential greenhouse gas emissions or carbon trading or tax programs. These costs and capital expenditures could be material. Although uncertain, these developments could increase our costs, reduce the demand for crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and synthetic crude oil, and create delays in our obtaining air pollution permits for new or modified facilities. The potential adoption of federal, state and local legislative and regulatory initiatives related to hydraulic fracturing, including the operation of injection wells, could result in increased compliance costs, operating restrictions or delays in the completion of oil and gas wells. Hydraulic fracturing is a commonly used process that involves injecting water, sand, and small volumes of chemicals into the wellbore to fracture the hydrocarbon-bearing rock thousands of feet below the surface to facilitate higher flow of hydrocarbons into the wellbore. Our business uses this technique extensively throughout our operations. Hydraulic fracturing has been regulated at the state and local level through permitting and compliance requirements. Federal, state and local-level laws or regulations targeting various aspects of the hydraulic fracturing process are being considered, or have been proposed or implemented. For example, the U.S. Congress has considered legislation that would require additional regulation affecting the hydraulic fracturing process, and may be expected to do so in future legislative sessions. Further, various state and local-level initiatives in regions with substantial shale resources have been or may be proposed or implemented to further regulate hydraulic fracturing practices, limit water withdrawals and water use, require disclosure of fracturing fluid constituents, restrict which additives may be used, or implement temporary or permanent bans on hydraulic fracturing. In addition to such legislative and regulatory proposals, there are also a number of studies and initiatives underway that may lead to additional proposals in the future, such as the EPA research study on the potential effects that hydraulic fracturing may have on water quality and public health. In 2015 the Bureau of Land Management issued a rule governing certain hydraulic fracturing practices on lands within their jurisdiction. While this rule has been stayed nationwide by court ruling, further findings by the court could result in additional changes to this new rule.Increased regulation and attention given to the hydraulic fracturing process could lead to greater opposition, including litigation, to oil and gas activities using hydraulic fracturing techniques. Additional legislation or regulation could also lead to operational delays or increased operating costs in the production of crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas, including from the shale plays, or could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing. The adoption of any federal, state or local laws or the implementation of regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing could potentially cause a decrease in the completion of new oil and gas wells and increased compliance costs which could increase costs of our operations and cause considerable delays in acquiring regulatory approvals to drill and complete wells.State and federal regulatory agencies recently have focused on a possible connection between the operation of injection wells used for oil and gas waste disposal and seismic activity. Similar concerns have been raised that hydraulic fracturing may also contribute to seismic activity. When caused by human activity, such events are called induced seismicity. In a few instances, operators of injection wells in the vicinity of seismic events have been ordered to reduce injection volumes or suspend operations. A 2012 report published by the National Academy of Sciences concluded that only a very small fraction of the tens of thousands of injection wells have been suspected to be, or have been, the likely cause of induced seismicity; and a 2015 report by researchers at the University of Texas has suggested that the link between seismic activity and wastewater disposal may vary by region. Some state regulatory agencies have modified their regulations to account for induced seismicity. Regulatory agencies at all levels are continuing to study the possible linkage between oil and gas activity and induced seismicity. In addition, a number of lawsuits have been filed including recent negligence suits and a RCRA citizen suit in Oklahoma alleging that disposal well operations have caused damage to neighboring properties or otherwise violated state and federal rules regulating waste disposal. These developments could result in additional regulation and restrictions on the use of injection wells and hydraulic fracturing. Increased regulation and attention given to induced seismicity could lead to greater opposition, including litigation, to oil and gas activities utilizing hydraulic fracturing or injection wells for waste disposal. Additional legislation or regulation could also lead to operational delays or increased operating costs in the production of crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas, including from the shale plays, or could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic 29fracturing. The adoption of any federal, state or local laws or the implementation of regulations regarding induced seismicity could potentially cause a decrease in the completion of new oil and gas wells and increased compliance costs which could increase costs of our operations and cause considerable delays in acquiring regulatory approvals to drill and complete wells.Worldwide political and economic developments and changes in law could adversely affect our operations and materially reduce our profitability and cash flows.Local political and economic factors in global markets could have a material adverse effect on us. A total of 39% of our liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas sales volumes related to continuing operations in 2015 was derived from production outside the U.S. and 56% of our proved crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas reserves as of December 31, 2015 were located outside the U.S. All of our synthetic crude oil production and proved reserves are located in Canada. We are, therefore, subject to the political, geographic and economic risks and possible terrorist activities or other armed conflict attendant to doing business within or outside of the U.S. There are many risks associated with operations in countries such as E.G., Ethiopia, Gabon, the Kurdistan Region of Iraq and Libya, and in global markets including: •changes in governmental policies relating to liquid hydrocarbon or natural gas and taxation;•other political, economic or diplomatic developments and international monetary fluctuations;•political and economic instability, war, acts of terrorism, armed conflict and civil disturbances;•the possibility that a government may seize our property with or without compensation, may attempt to renegotiate or revoke existing contractual arrangements or may impose additional taxes or royalty burdens; and•fluctuating currency values, hard currency shortages and currency controls.For the past several years, there have been varying degrees of political instability and public protests, including demonstrations which have been marked by violence and numerous incidences of terrorist acts, within some countries in the Middle East, including Bahrain, Egypt, Iraq, Libya, Syria, Tunisia and Yemen. Some political regimes in these countries are threatened or have changed as a result of such unrest. If such unrest continues to spread, conflicts could result in civil wars, regional conflicts, and regime changes resulting in governments that are hostile to the U.S. These may have the following results, among others:•volatility in global crude oil prices which could negatively impact the global economy, resulting in slower economic growth rates and reduced demand for our products;•negative impact on the world crude oil supply if transportation avenues are disrupted;•security concerns leading to the prolonged evacuation of our personnel;•damage to, or the inability to access, production facilities or other operating assets; and•inability of our service and equipment providers to deliver items necessary for us to conduct our operations.Continued hostilities in the Middle East and the occurrence or threat of future terrorist attacks, or other armed conflict, could adversely affect the economies of the U.S. and other developed countries. A lower level of economic activity could result in a decline in energy consumption, which could cause our revenues and margins to decline and limit our future growth prospects. These risks could lead to increased volatility in prices for crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and synthetic crude oil. In addition, these risks could increase instability in the financial and insurance markets and make it more difficult for us to access capital and to obtain the insurance coverage that we consider adequate.Actions of governments through tax legislation and other changes in law, executive order and commercial restrictions could reduce our operating profitability, both in the U.S. and abroad. The U.S. government can prevent or restrict us from doing business in foreign countries. These restrictions and those of foreign governments have in the past limited our ability to operate in, or gain access to, opportunities in various countries and will continue to do so in the future. Changes in law could also adversely affect our results, including new regulations resulting in higher costs to transport our production by pipeline, rail car, truck or vessel or the adoption of government payment transparency regulations that could require us to disclose competitively sensitive commercial information or that could cause us to violate the non-disclosure laws of other countries.Our level of indebtedness may limit our liquidity and financial flexibility. Our total debt was $7.3 billion as of December 31, 2015. Our indebtedness could have important consequences to our business, including, but not limited to, the following:•we may be more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions;30•a portion of our cash flows from operating activities must be used to service our indebtedness and is not available for other purposes;•our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our industry may be limited;•we may be at a competitive disadvantage as compared to similar companies that have less debt; and•additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or development activities, general corporate or other purposes may have higher costs and more restrictive covenants.We may incur additional debt in order to fund our capital expenditures, acquisitions or development activities, or for general corporate or other purposes. A higher level of indebtedness increases the risk that our financial flexibility may deteriorate. Our ability to meet our debt obligations and service our debt depends on future performance. General economic conditions, crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and synthetic crude oil prices, and financial, business and other factors will affect our operations and our future performance. Many of these factors are beyond our control and we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to pay the interest on our debt, and future working capital, borrowings and equity financing may not be available to pay or refinance such debt. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of debt obligations. A downgrade in our credit rating, particularly below investment grade, could negatively impact our cost of and ability to access capital, which could adversely affect our business. We receive debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies in the United States. The credit rating process is contingent upon a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. A downgrade of our credit ratings, particularly below investment grade, could negatively impact our cost of capital and our ability to access the capital markets, increase the interest rate and fees we pay on our revolving credit facility, and restrict our access to the commercial paper market. We could also be required to post letters of credit or other forms of collateral for certain obligations, which could increase our costs and decrease our liquidity or letter of credit capacity under our unsecured revolving credit facility. Limitations on our ability to access capital could adversely impact the level of our capital spending program, our ability to manage our debt maturities, or our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions.Our commodity price risk management may prevent us from fully benefiting from commodity price increases and may expose us to other risks, including counterparty risk.To the extent that we engage in price risk management activities to protect ourselves against commodity price declines, we may be prevented from fully realizing the benefits of price increases above the levels of the derivative instruments used to manage price risk. In addition, our hedging arrangements may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including instances in which the counterparties to our hedging contracts fail to perform under the contracts. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.Our business could be negatively impacted by cyber-attacks targeting our computer and telecommunications systems and infrastructure. Our business, like other companies in the oil and gas industry, has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies. Such technologies are integrated into our business operations and used as a part of our liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas production and distribution systems in the U.S. and abroad, including those systems used to transport production to market. Use of the internet and other public networks for communications, services, and storage, including “cloud” computing, exposes users (including our business) to cybersecurity risks. While our information systems and related infrastructure experienced attempted and actual minor breaches of our cybersecurity in the past, we have not suffered any losses or breaches which had a material effect on our business, operations or reputation relating to such attacks; however, there is no assurance that we will not suffer such losses or breaches in the future. As cyber-attacks continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information systems and related infrastructure security vulnerabilities.Our operations may be adversely affected by pipeline, rail and other transportation capacity constraints.The marketability of our production depends in part on the availability, proximity, and capacity of pipeline facilities, rail cars, trucks and vessels. If any pipelines, rail cars, trucks or vessels become unavailable, we would, to the extent possible, be required to find a suitable alternative to transport our crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and synthetic crude oil, which could increase the costs and/or reduce the revenues we might obtain from the sale of our production. Both the cost and availability of pipelines, rail cars, trucks, or vessels to transport our crude oil could be adversely impacted by new and expected state or federal regulations relating to transportation of crude oil.31If we acquire crude oil and natural gas properties, our failure to fully identify existing and potential problems, to accurately estimate reserves, production rates or costs, or to effectively integrate the acquired properties into our operations could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.We typically seek the acquisition of liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas properties. Although we perform reviews of properties to be acquired in a manner that we believe is diligent and consistent with industry practices, reviews of records and properties may not necessarily reveal existing or potential problems, nor may they permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties in order to fully assess possible deficiencies and potential problems. Even when problems with a property are identified, we often assume environmental and other risks and liabilities in connection with acquired properties pursuant to the acquisition agreements. Moreover, there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves (as previously discussed), actual future production rates and associated costs with respect to acquired properties. Actual reserves, production rates and costs may vary substantially from those assumed in our estimates. In addition, an acquisition may have a material and adverse effect on our business and results of operations, particularly during the periods in which the operations of the acquired properties are being integrated into our ongoing operations or if we are unable to effectively integrate the acquired properties into our ongoing operations.We operate in a highly competitive industry, and many of our competitors are larger and have available resources in excess of our own. The oil and gas industry is highly competitive, and many competitors, including major integrated and independent oil and gas companies, as well as national oil companies, are larger and have substantially greater resources at their disposal than we do. We compete with these companies for the acquisition of oil and natural gas leases and other properties. We also compete with these companies for equipment and personnel, including petroleum engineers, geologists, geophysicists and other specialists, required to develop and operate those properties and in the marketing of liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas to end-users. Such competition can significantly increase costs and affect the availability of resources, which could provide our larger competitors a competitive advantage when acquiring equipment, leases and other properties. They may also be able to use their greater resources to attract and retain experienced personnel. Many of our major projects and operations are conducted with partners, which may decrease our ability to manage risk.We often enter into arrangements to conduct certain business operations, such as oil and gas exploration and production, or oil sands mining, with partners in order to share risks associated with those operations. However, these arrangements also may decrease our ability to manage risks and costs, particularly where we are not the operator. We could have limited influence over and control of the behaviors and performance of these operations. In addition, misconduct, fraud, noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations or improper activities by or on behalf of one or more of our partners could have a significant negative impact on our business and reputation.Our operations are subject to business interruptions and casualty losses. We do not insure against all potential losses and therefore we could be seriously harmed by unexpected liabilities and increased costs.Our North America E&P and International E&P operations are subject to unplanned occurrences, including blowouts, explosions, fires, loss of well control, spills, hurricanes and other adverse weather, tsunamis, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions or nuclear or other disasters, labor disputes and accidents. Our OSM operations are subject to business interruptions due to breakdown or failure of equipment or processes and unplanned events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions or other interruptions. These same risks can be applied to the third-parties which transport our products from our facilities. A prolonged disruption in the ability of any pipelines, rail cars, trucks, or vessels to transport our production could contribute to a business interruption or increase costs.Our operations are also subject to the additional hazards of pollution, releases of toxic gas and other environmental hazards and risks. These hazards could result in serious personal injury or loss of human life, significant damage to property and equipment, environmental pollution, impairment of operations and substantial losses to us. Various hazards have adversely affected us in the past, and damages resulting from a catastrophic occurrence in the future involving us or any of our assets or operations may result in our being named as a defendant in one or more lawsuits asserting potentially large claims or in our being assessed potentially substantial fines by governmental authorities. We maintain insurance against many, but not all, potential losses or liabilities arising from operating hazards in amounts that we believe to be prudent. Uninsured losses and liabilities arising from operating hazards could reduce the funds available to us for capital, exploration and investment spending and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Historically, we have maintained insurance coverage for physical damage and resulting business interruption to our major onshore and offshore facilities, with significant self-insured retentions. In the future, we may not be able to maintain or obtain insurance of the type and amount we desire at reasonable rates. As a result of market conditions, premiums and deductibles for certain of our insurance policies have increased and could escalate further. In some instances, certain insurance could become unavailable 32or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. For example, due to hurricane activity in recent years, the availability of insurance coverage for windstorms has been reduced or, in many instances, it is prohibitively expensive. As a result, our exposure to losses from future windstorm activity has increased.Litigation by private plaintiffs or government officials could adversely affect our performance.We currently are defending litigation and anticipate that we will be required to defend new litigation in the future. The subject matter of such litigation may include releases of hazardous substances from our facilities, privacy laws, antitrust laws, contract disputes, royalty disputes or any other laws or regulations that apply to our operations. In some cases the plaintiff or plaintiffs seek alleged damages involving large classes of potential litigants, and may allege damages relating to extended periods of time or other alleged facts and circumstances. If we are not able to successfully defend such claims, they may result in substantial liability. We do not have insurance covering all of these potential liabilities. In addition to substantial liability, litigation may also seek injunctive relief which could have an adverse effect on our future operations.In connection with our separation from MPC, MPC agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities. However, there can be no assurance that the indemnity will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities, or that MPC’s ability to satisfy its indemnification obligations will not be impaired in the future.Pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement and the Tax Sharing Agreement we entered into with MPC in connection with the spin-off, MPC agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities. However, third parties could seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that MPC agreed to retain or assume, and there can be no assurance that the indemnification from MPC will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities, or that MPC will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations. In addition, even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from MPC any amounts for which we are held liable, we may be temporarily required to bear these losses ourselves.The spin-off could result in substantial tax liability.We obtained a private letter ruling from the IRS substantially to the effect that the distribution of shares of MPC common stock in the spin-off qualified as tax free to MPC, us and our stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 355 and 368 and related provisions of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). If the factual assumptions or representations made in the request for the private letter ruling prove to have been inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect, then we will not be able to rely on the ruling. Furthermore, the IRS does not rule on whether a distribution such as the spin-off satisfies certain requirements necessary to obtain tax-free treatment under Section 355 of the Code. Rather, the private letter ruling was based on representations by us that those requirements were satisfied, and any inaccuracy in those representations could invalidate the ruling. In connection with the spin-off, we also obtained an opinion of outside counsel, substantially to the effect that, the distribution of shares of MPC common stock in the spin-off qualified as tax free to MPC, us and our stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 355 and 368 and related provisions of the Code. The opinion relied on, among other things, the continuing validity of the private letter ruling and various assumptions and representations as to factual matters made by MPC and us which, if inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect, would jeopardize the conclusions reached by such counsel in its opinion. The opinion is not binding on the IRS or the courts, and there can be no assurance that the IRS or the courts would not challenge the conclusions stated in the opinion or that any such challenge would not prevail.If, notwithstanding receipt of the private letter ruling and opinion of counsel, the spin-off were determined not to qualify under Section 355 of the Code, each U.S. holder of our common stock who received shares of MPC common stock in the spin-off would generally be treated as receiving a taxable distribution of property in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares of MPC common stock received. That distribution would be taxable to each such stockholder as a dividend to the extent of our accumulated earnings and profits as of the effective date of the spin-off. For each such stockholder, any amount that exceeded those earnings and profits would be treated first as a non-taxable return of capital to the extent of such stockholder’s tax basis in its shares of our common stock with any remaining amount being taxed as a capital gain. We would be subject to tax as if we had sold all the outstanding shares of MPC common stock in a taxable sale for their fair market value and would recognize taxable gain in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of such shares over our tax basis in such shares.Under the terms of the Tax Sharing Agreement we entered into with MPC in connection with the spin-off, MPC is generally responsible for any taxes imposed on MPC or us and our subsidiaries in the event that the spin-off and/or certain related transactions were to fail to qualify for tax-free treatment as a result of actions taken, or breaches of representations and warranties made in the Tax Sharing Agreement, by MPC or any of its affiliates. However, if the spin-off and/or certain related transactions were to fail to qualify for tax-free treatment because of actions or failures to act by us or any of our affiliates, we would be responsible for all such taxes.33We may issue preferred stock whose terms could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of Marathon Oil common stock.Our restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such preferences, powers and relative, participating, optional and other rights, including preferences over Marathon Oil common stock respecting dividends and distributions, as our Board of Directors generally may determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of Marathon Oil common stock. For example, we could grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the common stock.Item 1B.
