PART I  Item 1. Business  Plan to Create Independent Downstream Company  On January 13, 2011, the Board of Directors of Marathon Oil Corporation (“Marathon”) announced that it has approved moving forward with plans to spin off our downstream (Refining, Marketing and Transportation) business, creating two independent energy companies: Marathon Petroleum Corporation (“MPC”) and Marathon Oil Corporation (“MRO”). To effect the spin-off, we intend to distribute one common share of MPC for every two common shares of Marathon held at a record date to be determined. The transaction is expected to be effective June 30, 2011, with distribution of MPC shares shortly thereafter. A tax ruling request was submitted to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) regarding the tax-free nature of the spin-off and we anticipate a response during the second quarter of 2011.  The above discussion of the plans to create an independent downstream company includes forward looking statements. Factors which could affect the plans include board approval, receipt of a favorable private letter ruling from the IRS and a registration statement declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).  General  Marathon Oil Corporation was originally organized in 2001 as USX HoldCo, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the former USX Corporation. As a result of a reorganization completed in July 2001, USX HoldCo, Inc. (1) became the parent entity of the consolidated enterprise (the former USX Corporation was merged into a subsidiary of USX HoldCo, Inc.) and (2) changed its name to USX Corporation. In connection with the transaction described in the next paragraph (the “USX Separation”), USX Corporation changed its name to Marathon Oil Corporation.  Before December 31, 2001, Marathon had two outstanding classes of common stock: USX-Marathon Group common stock, which was intended to reflect the performance of our energy business, and USX-U.S. Steel Group common stock (“Steel Stock”), which was intended to reflect the performance of our steel business. On December 31, 2001, we disposed of our steel business through a tax-free distribution of the common stock of our wholly-owned subsidiary United States Steel Corporation (“United States Steel”) to holders of Steel Stock in exchange for all outstanding shares of Steel Stock on a one-for-one basis.  In connection with the USX Separation, our certificate of incorporation was amended on December 31, 2001, and Marathon has had only one class of common stock authorized since that date.  Segment and Geographic Information  Our operations consist of four reportable operating segments: 1) Exploration and Production (“E&P”) – explores for, produces and markets liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas on a worldwide basis; 2) Oil Sands Mining (“OSM”) – mines, extracts and transports bitumen from oil sands deposits in Alberta, Canada, and upgrades the bitumen to produce and    1    Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements  market synthetic crude oil; 3) Integrated Gas (“IG”) – markets and transports products manufactured from natural gas, such as liquefied natural gas (“LNG”) and methanol, on a worldwide basis; and 4) Refining, Marketing and Transportation (“RM&T”) – refines, transports and markets crude oil and petroleum products, primarily in the Midwest, Gulf Coast and southeastern regions of the United States. For operating segment and geographic financial information, see Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.  The E&P, OSM and IG segments comprise our upstream operations. The RM&T segment comprises our downstream operations.  Exploration and Production  In the discussion that follows regarding our exploration and production operations, references to “net” wells, sales or investment indicate our ownership interest or share, as the context requires.  At the end of 2010, we were conducting oil and gas exploration, development or production activities in ten countries: the United States, Angola, Canada, Equatorial Guinea, Indonesia, Libya, Norway, Poland, the Iraqi Kurdistan Region, and the United Kingdom.  Our 2010 worldwide net liquid hydrocarbon sales averaged 245 thousand barrels per day (“mbpd”). Our 2010 worldwide net natural gas sales, including natural gas acquired for injection and subsequent resale, averaged 878 million cubic feet per day (“mmcfd”). In total, our 2010 worldwide net sales averaged 391 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (“mboepd”). For purposes of determining barrels of oil equivalent (“boe”), natural gas volumes are converted to approximate liquid hydrocarbon barrels by dividing the natural gas volumes expressed in thousands of cubic feet (“mcf”) by six. The liquid hydrocarbon volume is added to the barrel equivalent of natural gas volume to obtain boe.  In the United States during 2010, we drilled 77 gross (36 net) exploratory wells of which 73 gross (32 net) wells encountered commercial quantities of hydrocarbons. Of these 73 wells, 35 were temporarily suspended or in the process of being completed at year end. Internationally, we drilled 10 gross (2 net) exploratory wells of which 7 gross (1 net) wells encountered commercial quantities of hydrocarbons. All 7 wells were temporarily suspended or were in the process of being completed at December 31, 2010.  North America  United States – Our U.S. operations accounted for 29 percent of our 2010 worldwide net liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes and 41 percent of our worldwide net natural gas sales volumes.  Offshore – The Gulf of Mexico continues to be a core area, with over 20 prospects. At year end 2010, we held material interests in seven producing fields, four of which are company operated. An eighth field is under development and anticipated to come on-line in 2011.  Gulf of Mexico Drilling Moratorium – On April 22, 2010, the Deepwater Horizon, a rig that was engaged in drilling operations in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, sank after an explosion and fire. The incident resulted in a significant oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. Marathon had no involvement in the incident.  As a result of the Deepwater Horizon incident, the U.S. Department of the Interior issued a drilling moratorium on May 30, 2010, to suspend the drilling of deepwater wells, and prohibit drilling any new deepwater wells (defined as greater than 500 foot water depth). Shortly after the moratorium was issued, we temporarily suspended drilling an exploratory well on the Innsbruck prospect, located on Mississippi Canyon Block 993. Although the drilling moratorium was lifted on October 12, 2010, it is not known when plans and permits will be approved for future deepwater drilling activity. We sent a Revised Development Operations Coordination Document for the Ozona completion and a Revised Exploration Plan for the Innsbruck well to the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management Regulation and Enforcement (“BOEMRE”). We continue to update our revised Oil Spill Response Plan as new and updated requirements come from the BOEMRE. We filed our first deepwater Exploration Plan since the Deepwater Horizon incident to the BOEMRE on October 15, 2010. We are continuing to engage the BOEMRE to provide them with all the requested information. The BOEMRE has not yet deemed our plan submitted. The effects of new or additional laws or regulations that may be adopted in response to this incident are not fully known at this time and may impact future project execution.  We operate the Ewing Bank 873 platform which is located 130 miles south of New Orleans, Louisiana. The platform started operations in 1994 and serves as a production hub for the Ewing Bank 873 (Lobster), Ewing Bank 917 (Oyster) and Ewing Bank 963 (Arnold) fields. The facility also processes third-party production via subsea tie-backs.    2    Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements We own a 50 percent interest in the outside-operated Petronius field on Viosca Knoll Blocks 786 and 830. The Petronius platform is capable of providing processing and transportation services to nearby third-party fields.  The Neptune development commenced production of liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas in July 2008. We hold a 30 percent working interest in this outside-operated development located on Atwater Valley 575, 120 miles off the coast of Louisiana. The completed Phase I development included six subsea wells tied back to a stand-alone platform. Phase II development activities have begun and the first well in this program was successfully drilled and completed in late 2009.  Our Droshky development in the Gulf of Mexico on Green Canyon Block 244 began production in mid-July of 2010 and reached peak net production of 45,000 boepd in the third quarter of 2010. Production declines have been steeper than anticipated due to reservoir compartmentalization and lack of aquifer support. This subsea project consists of four development wells tied back to a third-party platform. Three of the four wells are currently producing. We plan to re-enter the fourth well in the first quarter of 2011. We hold a 100 percent operated working interest and an 81 percent net revenue interest in Droshky.  Development of our operated Ozona prospect, located on Garden Banks Block 515, has also continued. We are in the process of securing a rig to complete the previously drilled appraisal well and tie back to the nearby third-party Auger platform. First production of liquid hydrocarbon is expected in 2011. We hold a 68 percent working interest in Ozona.  In 2008, we drilled a successful oil appraisal well on the Stones prospect located on Walker Ridge Block 508. We hold a 25 percent interest in the outside-operated Stones prospect. In the third quarter of 2008, we announced deepwater oil discovery on the Gunflint prospect located on Mississippi Canyon Block 948. We own a 13 percent interest in this outside-operated prospect. In the first quarter of 2009, we participated in a deepwater oil discovery on the Shenandoah prospect located on Walker Ridge Block 52. We own a 10 percent interest in the outside-operated prospect.  In December 2009, we began drilling an exploratory well on the Flying Dutchman prospect, located on Green Canyon Block 511 in the Gulf of Mexico. We have 63 percent ownership and are the operator of this liquid hydrocarbon prospect. The Flying Dutchman reached its targeted total depth in early May 2010. The well encountered hydrocarbon-bearing sands that require further technical evaluation. The results of the Flying Dutchman well will continue to be evaluated to determine overall commerciality.  In addition to the prospects listed above, we held interests in 103 blocks in the Gulf of Mexico at the end of 2010, including 97 in the deepwater area. Our plans call for exploration drilling on some of these leases in 2011 and 2012, presuming a favorable regulatory environment that will allow deep-water drilling to resume.  Onshore – We hold 391,000 net acres in the Bakken shale oil play in the Williston Basin of North Dakota with a working interest of approximately 80 percent. Approximately 275 company-operated locations will be drilled over the next 4 years. We are evaluating other potential horizons above and below the Middle Bakken. We currently have six operated drilling rigs running in our Bakken shale program, and will add a rig solely dedicated to completion operations in the first quarter of 2011.  In the Anadarko Woodford shale horizon, a liquids-rich play in Oklahoma, we continue to expand our acreage position and now hold approximately 88,000 net acres within the play. We have existing production operations in this geographical area which will facilitate early drilling, with initial wells currently in progress. We plan to increase from three to eight company operated rigs in 2011. We also have domestic natural gas operations in Oklahoma, East Texas, and North Louisiana with combined net gas sales of 103 mmcfd in 2010.  In December 2010, we entered into an agreement with an operator in the Eagle Ford shale, a liquids-rich play in Texas. We initially paid $10 million and will drill and complete four wells to earn approximately 17,000 net acres. We also have an option that expires October 31, 2011 to purchase the operator’s remaining 58,000 net acres at a total cost of approximately $209 million, including the initial payment, carried well interest and lease extensions. In the event that we do not exercise the purchase option, the operator has the option to put the remaining 58,000 acres to us at a total cost, including the initial payment, carried well interest and lease extensions, of approximately $92 million.  We hold leases with natural gas production in the Piceance Basin of Colorado, located in Garfield County in the Greater Grand Valley field complex. We acquired approximately 177,000 net acres within the Niobrara play in the DJ Basin of northern Colorado and southeast Wyoming. We expect to commence drilling in 2011 and will leverage our Bakken operating experience. Net liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas sales from our existing Wyoming fields averaged 24 mbpd and 106 mmcfd in 2010. We plan to drill approximately 20 company operated wells in 2011 in the Big Horn, Wind River and Powder River Basins.    3    Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements We hold acreage in two additional emerging shale resource plays in the U.S. In the Appalachian Basin we hold 80,000 net acres in the Marcellus shale natural gas play in Pennsylvania and West Virginia. In February 2011, we entered into a joint venture with a company on a large portion of our Marcellus shale acreage position. Under the agreement terms, the company will to earn 50 percent of approximately 60,000 acres under a drilling carry. The company also has an option to acquire our remaining acreage while we retain the rights to continue to market the acreage to others. We drilled three wells in 2010 and five in 2009. In Louisiana and east Texas, we hold 20,000 net acres in the Haynesville shale natural gas play, where we drilled two wells in 2010 and one in 2009.  We produce natural gas in the Cook Inlet and adjacent Kenai Peninsula of Alaska. We have operated and outside-operated interests in ten fields and hold a 51 to 100 percent working interest in each. Typically, our natural gas sales from Alaska are seasonal in nature, trending down during the second and third quarters of each year and increasing during the fourth and first quarters. To manage supplies to meet contractual demand we produce and store natural gas in a partially depleted reservoir in the Kenai natural gas field. In 2010, we drilled three operated wells in Alaska and plan to drill one to three company-operated wells per year during 2011 and 2012.  Canada – We hold interests in both operated and outside-operated exploration stage in-situ oil sand leases as a result of the acquisition of Western in 2007. The three potential in-situ developments are Namur, in which we hold a 60 percent operated interest, Birchwood, in which we hold a 100 percent operated interest, and Ells River, in which we hold a 20 percent outside-operated interest. Initial test drilling on the Birchwood prospect confirmed bitumen presence and an additional 70 test wells are planned in 2011 to assess reservoir quality. Sanction of the initial phase of the Birchwood development is anticipated in 2014, with resulting first production expected in 2016.  Africa  Equatorial Guinea – We own a 63 percent operated working interest in the Alba field which is offshore Equatorial Guinea. During 2010, Equatorial Guinea net liquid hydrocarbon sales were 15 percent of our worldwide net liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes, and net natural gas sales were 46 percent of our worldwide net natural gas sales.  We also own a 52 percent interest in Alba Plant LLC, an equity method investee that operates an onshore liquefied petroleum gas (“LPG”) processing plant. Alba field natural gas is processed by the LPG plant under a long-term contract at a fixed price for the British thermal units used in the operations of the LPG plant and for the hydrocarbons extracted from the natural gas stream in the form of secondary condensate and LPG. During 2010, a gross 753 mmcfd of natural gas was supplied to the LPG production facility and the resulting net liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes in 2010 included 3 mbpd of secondary condensate and 11 mbpd of LPG produced by Alba Plant LLC.  As part of our Integrated Gas segment, we own 45 percent of Atlantic Methanol Production Company LLC (“AMPCO”) and 60 percent of Equatorial Guinea LNG Holdings Limited (“EGHoldings”), both of which are accounted for as equity method investments. AMPCO operates a methanol plant and EGHoldings operates an LNG production facility, both located on Bioko Island. Dry natural gas from the Alba field, which remains after the condensate and LPG are removed, is supplied to both of these facilities under long-term contracts at fixed prices. Because of the location of and limited local demand for natural gas in Equatorial Guinea, we consider the prices under the contracts with Alba Plant LLC, AMPCO and EGHoldings to be comparable to the price that could be realized from transactions with unrelated parties in this market under the same or similar circumstances. Our share of the income ultimately generated by the subsequent export of secondary condensate and LPG produced by Alba Plant LLC is reflected in our E&P segment. Our share of the income ultimately generated by the subsequent export of methanol produced by AMPCO and LNG produced by EGHoldings is reflected in our Integrated Gas segment as discussed below. During 2010, a gross 108 mmcfd of dry natural gas was supplied to the methanol plant and a gross 623 mmcfd of dry gas was supplied to the LNG production facility. Any remaining dry gas is returned offshore and reinjected into the Alba field for later production.  We hold a 63 percent operated interest in the Deep Luba discovery on the Alba Block and we are the operator with a 90 percent interest in the Corona well on Block D. These wells are part of our long-term LNG strategy. We expect these discoveries to be developed when the natural gas supply from the nearby Alba field starts to decline.  Angola – Offshore Angola, we hold 10 percent interests in Block 31 and Block 32, both of which are outside-operated. The discoveries on Blocks 31 and 32 represent four potential development hubs. The Plutao, Saturno, Venus and Marte discoveries and one successful appraisal well form a planned development area in the northeastern portion of Block 31. In 2008, we received approval to proceed with this first deepwater development project, called the PSVM development. The PSVM development will utilize a floating, production, storage and offloading (“FPSO”) vessel. A total of 48 production and injection wells are planned with development drilling currently underway. First production is anticipated in 2012. Other discoveries on Block 31 comprise potential development areas in the southeast and middle portions of the block. A development area in the south eastern portion of Block 32 is currently being evaluated with the potential to include 6 fields for an anticipated first oil production in 2016.    4    Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Libya – We hold a 16 percent interest in the Waha concessions, which encompass almost 13 million acres located in the Sirte Basin. Our exploration program in 2010 included the drilling of 10 wells, including 2 carry over wells from 2009: seven of these wells were discoveries, two were dry and abandoned, and one was drilling as of yearend. We drilled 28 development wells in Libya in 2010. Phase II of the Faregh project began commissioning during the third quarter of 2010, with production coming on line in November.  Europe  Norway – Norway continues to be a core area, which complements our long-standing operations in the U.K. sector of the North Sea discussed below. We were approved for our first operatorship on the offshore Norwegian continental shelf in 2002, where today we operate ten licenses and hold interests in over 240,000 net acres.  The operated Alvheim complex located on the Norwegian continental shelf commenced production in June 2008. The complex consists of a Floating Production, Storage and Offloading (“FPSO”) vessel with subsea infrastructure. Improved reliability, combined with optimization work, increased the throughput of the FPSO to 142 mbpd, up from the original design of 120 mbpd. Produced oil is transported by shuttle tanker and produced natural gas is transported to the existing U.K. Scottish Area Gas Evacuation (“SAGE”) system using a 14-inch diameter, 24-mile cross border pipeline. First production to the complex was from the Alvheim development which is comprised of the Kameleon, East Kameleon and Kneler fields, in which we have a 65 percent working interest, and the Boa field, in which we have a 58 percent working interest. At the end of 2010, the Alvheim development included 11 producing wells and 2 water disposal wells. A Phase 2 drilling program commenced in 2010, with 1 well on production since December 2010 and a further two production wells to be drilled in 2011. A Phase 2b drilling program consisting of 2 production wells is planned for 2011 and 2012.  The nearby outside-operated Vilje field, in which we own a 47 percent working interest, began producing through the Alvheim complex in August 2008.  In June 2009, we completed the drilling program for the Volund field as a subsea tieback to the Alvheim complex. The Volund development, in which we own a 65 percent operated interest, is located approximately five miles south of the Alvheim area and consists of three production wells and one water injection well. First production from Volund was announced in September 2009. In the second quarter of 2010, we commenced production at the Volund field which allows us to maintain full capacity on the Alvheim FPSO. Net sales from Alvheim, Vilje, and Volund for 2010 averaged 50 mbpd of liquid hydrocarbons and 30 mmcfd of natural gas.  Also offshore Norway, we and our partners announced the Marihone and Viper discoveries, both located within tie-back distance of the Alvheim FPSO. The Marihone oil discovery is located in license PL340 about 12 miles south of the Volund and Alvheim fields. We hold a 65 percent operated working interest in Marihone. The Viper oil discovery is located immediately next to Volund field in PL203, about 12 miles south of the Alvheim FPSO. We are the operator and hold a 65 percent interest in Viper. Conceptual development studies for both discoveries have begun. First production for both discoveries is anticipated in 2014.  In December 2010 a sales agreement was entered into for all of our interests in production licenses PL 025, PL 048E and PL 187. The transaction includes our outside-operated 20 percent interest in PL 025 (Gudrun field development) and PL 187 (Brynhild discovery), and 12.5 percent interest in PL 048E (Eirin discovery).  United Kingdom – Our largest asset in the U.K. sector of the North Sea is the Brae area complex where we are the operator and have a 42 percent working interest in the South, Central, North and West Brae fields and a 38 percent working interest in the East Brae field. The Brae A platform and facilities host the underlying South Brae field and the adjacent Central and West Brae fields. A two well development program commenced in 2010 for West Brae with one well on production in January 2011, and the second expected to produce by the end of March 2011. The North Brae field, which is produced via the Brae B platform, and the East Brae field, which is produced via the East Brae platform, are natural gas condensate fields. The East Brae platform hosts the nearby Braemar field in which we have a 28 percent working interest.  The strategic location of the Brae platforms along with pipeline and onshore infrastructure has generated third-party processing and transportation business since 1986. Currently, the operators of 30 third-party fields have contracted to use the Brae system. Most recently, in 2010, we agreed to commence construction and installation of a new module to accommodate the tie back of the third-party operated Devenick field. In addition to generating processing and pipeline tariff revenue, this third-party business also has a favorable impact on Brae area operations by optimizing infrastructure usage and extending the economic life of the complex.  The Brae group owns a 50 percent interest in the outside-operated SAGE system. The SAGE pipeline transports natural gas from the Brae area, and the third-party Beryl area, and has a total wet natural gas capacity of 1.1 billion    5    Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements  cubic feet (“bcf”) per day. The SAGE terminal at St. Fergus in northeast Scotland processes natural gas from the SAGE pipeline as well as approximately 1 bcf per day of third-party natural gas.  In the U.K. Atlantic Margin west of the Shetland Islands, we own an average 30 percent working interest in the outside-operated Foinaven area complex, consisting of a 28 percent working interest in the main Foinaven field, 47 percent working interest in East Foinaven and 20 percent working interest in the T35 and T25 fields. The FPSO is being upgraded which is expected to extend the life of this asset through 2021.  Poland – In 2010, we added 10 licenses with shale gas potential in Poland, increasing our total acreage position to approximately 2.3 million net acres in 11 licenses. We have a 100 percent interest and operate all 11 blocks. In 2011 we plan to acquire 2D seismic over all concessions by the end of the third quarter and plan to initiate drilling in the fourth quarter. We have recently been successful in farming-out a portion of our interest in this play. Under the agreement, our partner will earn a 40 percent working interest in 10 licenses, as well as pay a promote on certain future seismic and well costs. This transaction is subject to the approval of the Polish Ministry of the Environment. We will remain operator of the 10 licenses included in the agreement.  Other International  Indonesia – We are the operator and hold a 70 percent interest in the Pasangkayu Block located both onshore & offshore Sulawesi in the Makassar Strait, Indonesia. The Pasangkayu Block covers an area of approximately 872,000 acres and is located directly east of the Kutei Basin production region. The production sharing contract with the Indonesian government was signed in 2006 and we completed 3D seismic acquisition in May 2008.  In November 2010, the Bravo-1 well in the northeastern portion of the Pasangkayu block was drilled in a water depth of approximately 3,200 feet and reached a total depth of 9,000 feet. No hydrocarbon accumulations were present.  The Romeo prospect, located on the north-central portion of the Pasangkayu block in a water depth of 6,200 feet, is being drilled and is expected to be completed during the first half of 2011.  In 2009, we were awarded a 49 percent interest and operatorship in the Kumawa Block, an Indonesia offshore exploration block, located offshore West Papua. An increase in ownership to 55 percent received Indonesian government approval in late 2010. The Kumawa Block encompasses 1.24 million acres. A seismic survey was acquired in 2010 and we expect to drill one exploration well in 2012.  In October 2008, we were granted a 49 percent interest and operatorship in the Bone Bay Block offshore Sulawesi. An increase in ownership to 55 percent received Indonesian government approval in late 2010. The Bone Bay Block covers an area of 1.23 million acres and is 200 miles southeast of our Pasangkayu Block. A 2D seismic survey was acquired in 2009 and we expect to drill one exploration well in early 2012.  We continue to pursue joint study agreements in Indonesia, which provide a right of first refusal in future bid rounds. We completed one joint study agreement in 2010 and continue to evaluate regional potential for other opportunities.  Iraqi Kurdistan Region – In October 2010, we acquired a position in four exploration blocks in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. We have signed production sharing agreements for operatorship and an 80 percent ownership in two open blocks northeast of Erbil; Harir and Safen. The Kurdistan Regional Government (“KRG”) will hold a 20 percent carried interest. We were assigned working interests in two additional blocks located north-northwest of Erbil; Atrush, in which we have a 16 percent ownership (KRG holds a 4 percent carried interest), and Sarsang, in which we have a 20 ownership (KRG holds a 4 percent carried interest). These contracts provide us with access to approximately 368,000 net acres. We have committed to a seismic program and to drilling one well on each of the two open blocks during the initial three-year exploration period. The Atrush and Sarsang blocks each have one well currently drilling.  Divestitures  Angola – In February 2010, we closed the sale of an undivided 20 percent interest in the outside-operated production sharing contract and joint operating agreement on Block 32 offshore Angola effective January 1, 2009. We retained a 10 percent interest in Block 32.  The above discussion of the E&P segment includes forward-looking statements with respect to anticipated future exploratory and development drilling, the timing of production from the Ozona development in the Gulf of Mexico, the PSVM development on Block 31 offshore Angola and Block 32 and other possible developments. Some factors which could possible affect these forward-looking statements include pricing, supply and demand for petroleum products, the amount of capital available for exploration and development, regulatory constraints, drilling rig availability, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorist acts and the governmental or military response, and    6    Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements  other geological, operating and economic considerations. The foregoing forward-looking statements may be further affected by the inability to obtain or delay in obtaining necessary government and third-party approvals and permits. The offshore developments could further be affected by presently known data concerning size and character of reservoirs, economic recoverability, future drilling success and production experience.

Oil Sands Mining  We hold a 20 percent outside-operated interest in the Athabasca Oil Sands Project (“AOSP”), an oil sands mining joint venture located in Alberta, Canada. The joint venture produces bitumen from oil sands deposits in the Athabasca region utilizing mining techniques and upgrades the bitumen to synthetic crude oils. The AOSP’s mining and extractions assets are located near Fort McMurray, Alberta and include the Muskeg River mine which began bitumen production in 2003 and the Jackpine mine which commenced phased start-up in the third quarter of 2010. As of December 31, 2010, we have rights to participate in developed and undeveloped leases totaling approximately 215,000 gross (45,000 net) acres. The underlying developed leases are held for the duration of the project, with royalties payable to the province of Alberta. The upgrading assets are located at Fort Saskatchewan, northeast of Edmonton, Alberta.  The first fully integrated expansion of the existing AOSP facilities was approved in 2006. Expansion 1 includes construction of mining and extraction facilities at the Jackpine mine, new treatment facilities at the existing Muskeg River mine, addition of a new processing train at the Scotford upgrader and development of related infrastructure. A    8    Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements  phased start-up of the Jackpine mine operations began in the third quarter of 2010. At full capacity, the Jackpine mine will add 100,000 gross bpd to our previously existing capacity. The expanded upgrader began the commissioning and start-up phase, which will continue into early 2011. Stage 1 debottlenecking activities are scheduled to begin in 2011. Potential future expansions and additional debottlenecking opportunities remain under review.  A planned turnaround at the Muskeg River mine and the upgrader occurred from March through May 2010. Our net share of turnaround costs was $99 million. Production as the AOSP was halted in April 2010 before a staged resumption of operations in mid-May 2010.  Current AOSP operations use established processes to mine oil sands deposits from an open-pit mine, extract the bitumen and upgrade it into synthetic crude oils. Ore is mined using traditional truck and shovel mining techniques. The mined ore passes through primary crushers to reduce the ore chunks in size and is then sent to rotary breakers where the ore chunks are further reduced to smaller particles. The particles are combined with hot water to create slurry. The slurry moves through the extraction process where it separates into sand, clay and bitumen-rich froth. A solvent is added to the bitumen froth to separate out the remaining solids, water and heavy asphaltenes. The solvent washes the sand and produces clean bitumen that is required for the upgrader to run efficiently. The process yields a mixture of solvent and bitumen which is then transported from the mine to the Scotford upgrader via the approximately 300 mile Corridor Pipeline.  The bitumen is upgraded at Scotford using both hydrotreating and hydroconversion processes to remove sulfur and break the heavy bitumen molecules into lighter products. Blendstocks acquired from outside sources are utilized in the production of our saleable products. The three major products that the Scotford upgrader produces are light synthetic crude oil, heavy synthetic crude oil and vacuum gas oil. The vacuum gas oil is sold to an affiliate of the operator under a long term contract at market-related prices, and the other products are sold in the marketplace.  The above discussion of the Oil Sands Mining segment includes forward-looking statements concerning the start-up of the expanded upgrader. Factors which could affect this project include transportation logistics, availability of materials and labor, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions and delays or other risks customarily associated with start-up projects.    9    Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Reserves  Estimated Reserve Quantities  The following table sets forth estimated quantities of our net proved liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserves based upon an unweighted average of closing prices for the first day of each month in the 12-month periods ended December 31, 2010 and 2009. Approximately 60 percent of our proved reserves are located in Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (“OECD”) countries.  Reserves are disclosed by continent, by country, if the proved reserves related to any geographic area, on an oil-equivalent barrel basis represent 15 percent or more of our total proved reserves. A geographic area can be an individual country, group of countries within a continent, or a continent.

(b)  Our businesses in Ireland and Gabon were sold in 2009 and were reported as discontinued operations.  We previously reported OSM segment reserves as bitumen because oil sands mining was not considered an oil and gas producing activity by the SEC. Proved bitumen reserves reported as of December 31, 2008 were 388 mmboe.  The above estimated quantities of net proved liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves are forward-looking statements and are based on a number of assumptions, including (among others) commodity prices, presently known physical data concerning size and character of the reservoirs, economic recoverability, technology developments, future drilling success, industry economic conditions, levels of cash flow from operations, production experience and other operating considerations. The above estimated quantities of synthetic crude oil reserves are forward-looking statements and are based on presently known physical data, economic recoverability and operating conditions. To the extent these assumptions prove inaccurate, actual recoveries and development costs could be different than current estimates. For additional details of the estimated quantities of proved reserves at the end of each of the last three years, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data— Supplementary Information on Oil and Gas Producing Activities.  Preparation of Reserve Estimates  Our estimation of economically producible volumes of liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas is a highly technical process performed primarily by in-house teams of reservoir engineers and geoscience professionals. All estimates of reserves are made in compliance with SEC Rule 4-10 of Regulation S-X. Beginning December 31, 2009, reserve estimates are based upon the unweighted average of closing prices for the first day of each month in the respective 12-month period ended December 31. In 2008, reserve estimates were based on prices at December 31.  Liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserve estimates are reviewed and approved by our Corporate Reserves Group, which includes our Director of Corporate Reserves and her staff of Coordinators. Reserves estimates are developed and reviewed by Qualified Reserves Estimators (“QRE”). QRE are engineers or geoscientists with a minimum of a Bachelor of Science degree in the appropriate technical field, have a minimum of three years of industry experience with at least one year in reserve estimation and have completed Marathon’s Qualified Reserve Estimator training course. The Reserve Coordinators review all reserves estimates for all fields with proved reserves greater than 3 mmboe at a minimum of once every three years. Any change to proved reserve estimates in excess of 2.5 mmboe on a total field basis, within a single month, must be approved by Corporate Reserves Group management. All other proved reserve changes must be approved by a Reserve Coordinator.   Our Director of Corporate Reserves, who reports to our Chief Financial Officer, has a Bachelor of Science degree in petroleum engineering and a master of business administration. Her 36 years of experience in the industry include 25 with Marathon. She is active in industry and professional groups, having served on the Society of Petroleum Engineers (“SPE”) Oil and Gas Reserves Committee (“OGRC”) since 2004, chairing in 2008 and 2009. As a member of the OGRC, she participated in the development of the Petroleum Resource Management System (“PRMS”) and served on the Technical Program Committee for a 2007 SPE Reserves Estimation Workshop: Sharing the Vision focusing on PRMS. She chaired the development of the OGRC comments on the SEC’s proposed modernization of oil and gas reporting and was a member of the American Petroleum Institute’s Ad Hoc group that provided comments on the same topic.    11    Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements  Estimates of synthetic crude oil reserves are prepared by GLJ Petroleum Consultants of Calgary, Canada, third-party consultants. A copy of their December 31, 2010 report is filed as Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 10-K. The engineer responsible for the estimates of our oil sands mining reserves has 32 years of experience in petroleum engineering and has conducted surface mineable oil sands evaluations since 1986. He is a member of SPE, having served as regional director 1998 through 2001 and is a registered Practicing Professional Engineer in the Province of Alberta.  Audits of Estimates  Third-party consultants are engaged to audit the in-house reserve estimates for fields that comprise 80 percent of our total proved reserves over a rolling four-year period. We met this goal for the four-year period ended December 31, 2010, without conducting any third party audits in 2010. We established a tolerance level of 10 percent for reserve audits such that initial estimates by the third-party consultants are accepted if they are within 10 percent of our internal estimates. Should the third-party consultants’ initial analysis fail to reach our tolerance level, both our team and the consultants re-examine the information provided, request additional data and refine their analysis if appropriate. This resolution process is continued until both estimates are within 10 percent. This process did not result in significant changes to our reserve estimates in 2009 or 2008.  Netherland, Sewell and Associates, Inc. (“NSAI”) prepared an independent estimate of December 31, 2008 reserves for the Alba field in Equatorial Guinea. This reserve estimate was used by Corporate Reserves in much the same way third-party audits are now used. The NSAI summary report is Exhibit 99.2 to this Form 10-K. The senior members of the NSAI team have over fifty years of industry experience between them, having worked for large, international oil and gas companies before joining NSAI. The team lead has a master of science in mechanical engineering and is a member of SPE. The senior technical advisor has a bachelor of science in geophysics and is a member of the Society of Exploration Geophysicists, the American Association of Petroleum Geologists and the European Association of Geoscientists and Engineers. Both are licensed in the state of Texas.  Ryder Scott Company (“Ryder Scott”) performed audits of several of our fields in 2009. Their summary report on audits performed in 2009 is Exhibit 99.3 to this Form 10-K. The team lead for Ryder Scott has over 19 years of industry experience, having worked for a major international oil and gas company before joining Ryder Scott. He has a bachelor of science in mechanical engineering, is a member of SPE and is a registered Professional Engineer in the state of Texas.  The Corporate Reserves Group may also perform separate, detailed technical reviews of reserve estimates for significant fields that were acquired recently or for properties with problematic indicators such as excessively long lives, sudden changes in performance or changes in economic or operating conditions.  Changes in Proved Undeveloped Reserves  As of December 31, 2010, 405 mmboe of proved undeveloped reserves were reported, a decrease of 87 mmboe from December 31, 2009. The following table shows of the changes in total proved undeveloped reserves for 2010:             Beginning of year      492     Revisions of previous estimates     (30 )    Extensions, discoveries, and other additions     71     Transfer to developed     (128 )              End of year     405   Significant additions to proved undeveloped reserves during 2010 include 28 mmboe for development drilling in our Libya properties and 19 mmboe additional for development drilling in the Bakken Shale play. Revisions include 26 mmboe of proved undeveloped reserves reclassified as proved developed in Equatorial Guinea because operating pressures can be reduced more than originally anticipated with the existing equipment. Transfers include the movement of 67 mmboe from proved undeveloped to proved developed due to start up for the Jackpine mine Expansion 1 in Canada and 26 mmboe related to the commencement of production at the Gulf of Mexico Droshky development in July 2010. Costs incurred in the periods ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 relating to the development of proved undeveloped reserves, were $1,463 million, $792 million and $1,189 million.  Projects can remain in proved undeveloped reserves for extended periods in certain situations such as behind-pipe zones where reserves will not be accessed until the primary producing zone depletes, large development projects which take more than five years to complete, and the timing of when additional gas compression is needed. Of the 405 mmboe of proved undeveloped reserves at year end 2010, 30 percent of the volume is associated with projects that have been included in proved reserves for more than five years. The majority of this volume is related to a compression project in    12    Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements  Equatorial Guinea that was sanctioned by our Board of Directors in 2004 and is expected to be completed in 2015. The timing of the installation of compression is being deferred as a result of better than expected reservoir performance. In addition, the North Gialo project in Libya is being executed by the operator, encompassing a continuous drilling program and designing, fabricating, and installing extensive liquid handling and gas recycling facilities. In 2010, an engineering firm was awarded the bid for the front-end engineering and design activities. Long lead items are expected to be procured in 2011 and first production is expected in 2016. There are no other significant undeveloped reserves expected to be developed more than five years.  As of December 31, 2010, future development costs estimated to be required for the development of proved undeveloped liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserves for the years 2011 through 2015 are projected to be $884 million, $315 million, $379 million, $433 million, and $224 million.  The timing of future projects and estimated future development costs relating to the development of proved undeveloped liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserves are forward-looking statements and are based on a number of assumptions, including (among others) commodity prices, presently known physical data concerning size and character of the reservoirs, economic recoverability, technology developments, future drilling success, industry economic conditions, levels of cash flow from operations, production experience and other operating considerations. To the extent these assumptions prove inaccurate, actual recoveries and development costs could be different than current estimates.

Integrated Gas  Our integrated gas operations include natural gas liquefaction and regasification operations and methanol production operations. Also included in the financial results of the Integrated Gas segment are the costs associated with ongoing development of projects to link stranded natural gas resources with key demand areas.  We hold a 60 percent interest in EGHoldings, which is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. EGHoldings has a 3.7 million metric tonnes per annum (“mmtpa”) LNG production facility on Bioko Island in Equatorial Guinea. LNG from the production facility is sold under a 3.4 mmtpa, or 460 mmcfd, sales and purchase agreement with a 17-year term ending in 2024. The purchaser under the agreement takes delivery of the LNG on Bioko Island, with pricing linked principally to the Henry Hub index, regardless of destination. This production facility allows us to monetize our natural gas reserves from the Alba field, as natural gas for the facility is purchased from the Alba field participants under a long-term natural gas supply agreement. Gross sales of LNG from this production facility totaled 3.7 million metric tonnes in 2010. In 2010, we continued discussions with the government of Equatorial Guinea and our partners regarding a potential second LNG production facility on Bioko Island.  We own a 30 percent outside-operated interest in a natural gas liquefaction plant in Kenai Alaska. This facility began first production in 1969 and we currently lease one 87,500 cubic meter tankers to transport LNG to customers in Japan. In February 2011 we, along with the plant operator, announced that exports would cease in spring of 2011.  We own a 45 percent interest in AMPCO, which is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. AMPCO owns a methanol plant located in Malabo, Equatorial Guinea. Feedstock for the plant is supplied from our natural gas production from the Alba field. Gross sales of methanol from the plant totaled 850,605 metric tonnes in 2010. Production from the plant is used to supply customers in Europe and the U.S.    14    Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The above discussion of the Integrated Gas segment contains forward-looking statements with respect to the possible expansion of the LNG production facility in Equatorial Guinea. Factors that could potentially affect the possible expansion of the LNG production facility include partner and government approvals, access to sufficient natural gas volumes through exploration or commercial negotiations with other resource owners and access to sufficient regasification capacity. The foregoing factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.  Refining, Marketing and Transportation  We have refining, marketing and transportation operations concentrated primarily in the Midwest, Gulf Coast and Southeast regions of the U.S. We rank as the fifth largest crude oil refiner in the U.S. and the largest in the Midwest. Our operations include a six-plant refining network and an integrated terminal and transportation system which supplies wholesale and Marathon-brand customers as well as our own retail operations. Our wholly-owned retail marketing subsidiary Speedway LLC (“Speedway”) is one of the largest company-owned and -operated retail gasoline and convenience stores in the U.S.  In December 2010, we sold our St. Paul Park, Minnesota, refinery (including associated terminal, tankage and pipeline investments and 166 SuperAmerica retail outlets (collectively, “Minnesota Assets”). Operations for the Minnesota Assets are included in all of the annual statistics reported.  Refining  We currently own and operate six refineries with an aggregate refining capacity of 1,142 thousand barrels per day (“mbpd”) of crude oil as detailed in the table below.            Crude Oil Refining Capacity        (mbpd)         Garyville, Louisiana     464     Catlettsburg, Kentucky     212     Robinson, Illinois     206     Detroit, Michigan     106     Canton, Ohio     78     Texas City, Texas     76               Total      1,142   During 2010, our refineries processed 1,173 mbpd of crude oil and 162 mbpd of other charge and blend stocks. Our refineries include crude oil atmospheric and vacuum distillation, fluid catalytic cracking, catalytic reforming, desulfurization and sulfur recovery units. The refineries process a wide variety of crude oils and produce numerous refined products, ranging from transportation fuels, such as reformulated gasolines, blend-grade gasolines intended for blending with fuel ethanol and ultra-low sulfur diesel fuel, to heavy fuel oil and asphalt. Additionally, we manufacture aromatics, cumene, propane, propylene, and sulfur.  Our Garyville, Louisiana, refinery is located along the Mississippi River in southeastern Louisiana between New Orleans and Baton Rouge. The Garyville refinery is configured to processes heavy sour crude oil into products such as gasoline, distillates, sulfur, asphalt, propane, polymer grade propylene, isobutane and coke. An expansion project was completed in the fourth quarter of 2009 that increased Garyville’s crude oil refining capacity, making it one of the largest refineries in the U.S. Our Garyville refinery has earned designation as a U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Voluntary Protection Program (VPP) STAR site.  Our Catlettsburg, Kentucky, refinery is located in northeastern Kentucky on the western bank of the Big Sandy River, near the confluence with the Ohio River. The Catlettsburg refinery processes sweet and sour crude oils into products such as gasoline, asphalt, diesel, jet fuel, petrochemicals, propane, propylene and sulfur.  Our Robinson, Illinois, refinery is located in southeastern Illinois. The Robinson refinery processes sweet and sour crude oils into products such as multiple grades of gasoline, jet fuel, kerosene, diesel fuel, propane, propylene, sulfur and anode-grade coke. The Robinson refinery has earned designation as an OSHA VPP STAR site.  Our Detroit, Michigan, refinery is located near Interstate 75 in southwest Detroit. It is the only petroleum refinery currently operating in Michigan. The Detroit refinery processes light sweet and heavy sour crude oils, including Canadian crude oils, into products such as gasoline, diesel, asphalt, slurry, propane, chemical grade propylene and sulfur. In 2007, we approved a heavy oil upgrading and expansion project at this refinery, with a current projected cost of $2.2 billion (excluding capitalized interest). This project will enable the refinery to process an additional 80 mbpd of heavy sour crude oils, including Canadian bitumen blends, and will increase its crude oil refining capacity by about 15 mbpd. Construction    15    Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements  began in the first half of 2008 and reached 50 percent completion at December 31, 2010. The project is expected to be complete in the second half of 2012. Our Detroit refinery is certified as a Michigan VPP STAR site.  Our Canton, Ohio, refinery is located approximately 60 miles southeast of Cleveland, Ohio. The Canton refinery processes sweet and sour crude oils into products such as gasoline, diesel fuels, kerosene, propane, sulfur, asphalt, roofing flux, home heating oil and No. 6 industrial fuel oil.  Our Texas City, Texas, refinery is located on the Texas Gulf Coast approximately 30 miles south of Houston, Texas. The refinery processes sweet crude oil into products such as gasoline, propane, chemical grade propylene, slurry, sulfur and aromatics.  The above discussion includes forward-looking statements concerning the Detroit refinery heavy oil upgrading and expansion project. Some factors that could affect this project include transportation logistics, availability of materials and labor, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, delays in obtaining or conditions imposed by necessary government and third-party approvals and other risks customarily associated with construction projects.  Our refineries are integrated with each other via pipelines, terminals and barges to maximize operating efficiency. The transportation links that connect our refineries allow the movement of crude oil, feedstocks and intermediate products between refineries to optimize operations, produce higher margin products and utilize our processing capacity efficiently.

The demand for gasoline is seasonal in many of our markets, with demand typically being at its highest levels during the summer months.  We have blended ethanol into gasoline for over 20 years and expanded our blending program in 2007, in part due to federal regulations that require us to use specified volumes of renewable fuels. Ethanol volumes sold in blended gasoline averaged 68 mbpd in 2010, 60 mbpd in 2009 and 54 mbpd in 2008. The future expansion or contraction of our ethanol blending program will be driven by the economics of the ethanol supply and by government regulations. We sell reformulated gasoline, which is also blended with ethanol, in parts of our marketing territory, including: Chicago, Illinois; Louisville, Kentucky; northern Kentucky; and Milwaukee, Wisconsin. We also sell biodiesel-blended diesel in Illinois, Kentucky and Pennsylvania.  We produce propane at all six of our refineries. Propane is primarily used for home heating and cooking, as a feedstock within the petrochemical industry, for grain drying and as a fuel for trucks and other vehicles. Our propane sales are typically split evenly between the home heating market and industrial consumers.  We are a producer and marketer of petrochemicals and specialty products. Product availability varies by refinery and includes benzene, cumene, dilute naphthalene oil, molten sulfur, propylene, toluene and xylene. We market propylene, cumene and sulfur domestically to customers in the chemical industry. We also have the capacity to produce 1,400 tons per day of anode grade coke at our Robinson refinery, which is used to make carbon anodes for the aluminum smelting industry, and 5,600 tons per day of fuel grade coke at the Garyville refinery, which is used for power generation and in miscellaneous industrial applications.  We produce and market heavy residual fuel oil or related components at all six of our refineries. Heavy residual fuel oil is primarily used in the utility and ship bunkering (fuel) industries, though there are other more specialized uses of the product.  We have refinery based asphalt production capacity of up to 92 mbpd. We market asphalt through 33 owned or leased terminals throughout the Midwest and Southeast. We have a broad customer base, including approximately 641 asphalt-paving contractors, government entities (states, counties, cities and townships) and asphalt roofing shingle manufacturers. We sell asphalt in the wholesale and cargo markets via rail and barge. We also produce asphalt cements, polymer modified asphalt, emulsified asphalt and industrial asphalts.  We hold a 35 percent interest in an entity which owns and operates a 110-million-gallon-per-year ethanol production facility in Clymers, Indiana. We also own a 50 percent interest in an entity which owns a 110-million-gallon-per-year ethanol production facility in Greenville, Ohio. Both of these facilities are managed by a co-owner.  Pipeline transportation – We own a system of pipelines through Marathon Pipe Line LLC (“MPL”) and Ohio River Pipe Line LLC (“ORPL”), our wholly-owned subsidiaries.

Factors which could affect these plans include transportation logistics, availability of materials and labor, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, delays in obtaining or conditions imposed by necessary government and third-party approvals, and other risks customarily associated with construction projects.    18    Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Retail Marketing  Speedway, our wholly-owned subsidiary headquartered in Enon, Ohio, sells gasoline and merchandise through owned and operated retail outlets primarily under the Speedway® brand. Diesel fuel is also sold at a number of these outlets. Speedway retail outlets offer a wide variety of merchandise, such as prepared foods, beverages, and non-food items, as well as a significant number of proprietary items. For eleven consecutive quarters ending September 30, 2010, Speedway has been rated as the best convenience store chain in terms of overall customer satisfaction in a national consumer perception survey conducted by Corporate Research International®. In 2010, Harris Interactive’s EquiTrend® annual brand equity study named Speedway® the number one gasoline brand with consumers for the second year in a row. Speedway’s Speedy Rewards™, an industry-leading customer loyalty program, has built active membership to 3.5 million customers.  As of December 31, 2010, Speedway had 1,358 retail outlets in seven states. Sales of refined products through these retail outlets accounted for 13 percent of our refined product sales volumes in 2010 and provide us with a base of ratable sales. Revenues from sales of non-petroleum merchandise through these retail outlets totaled $3,195 million in 2010, $3,109 million in 2009 and $2,838 million in 2008. The demand for gasoline is seasonal in a majority of Speedway markets, with the highest demand usually occurring during the summer driving season. Margins from the sale of merchandise and services tend to be less volatile than margins from the retail sale of gasoline and diesel fuel.  Competition and Market Conditions  Strong competition exists in all sectors of the oil and gas industry and, in particular, in the exploration for and development of new reserves. We compete with major integrated and independent oil and gas companies, as well as national oil companies, for the acquisition of oil and natural gas leases and other properties. We compete with these companies for the equipment and labor required to develop and operate those properties and in the marketing of oil and natural gas to end-users. Many of our competitors have financial and other resources greater than those available to us. Acquiring exploration opportunities frequently requires competitive bids involving front-end bonus payments or commitments-to-work programs. We also compete in attracting and retaining personnel, including geologists, geophysicists and other specialists. Based upon statistics compiled in the “2010 Global Upstream Performance Review” published by IHS Herold Inc., we rank ninth among U.S.-based petroleum companies on the basis of 2009 worldwide liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas production.  We also compete with other producers of synthetic and conventional crude oil for the sale of our synthetic crude oil to refineries primarily in North America. Additional synthetic crude oil projects are being contemplated by various competitors and, if undertaken and completed, these projects may result in a significant increase in the supply of synthetic crude oil to the market. Since not all refineries are able to process or refine synthetic crude oil in significant volumes, there can be no assurance that sufficient market demand will exist at all times to absorb our share of the synthetic crude oil production from the AOSP at economically viable prices.  We must also compete with a large number of other companies to acquire crude oil for refinery processing and in the distribution and marketing of a full array of petroleum products. Based upon the “The Oil & Gas Journal 2010 Worldwide Refinery Survey”, we rank fifth among U.S. petroleum companies on the basis of U.S. crude oil refining capacity as of December 31, 2010. We compete in four distinct markets for the sale of refined products – wholesale, spot, branded and retail distribution. We believe we compete with about 56 companies in the sale of refined products to wholesale marketing customers, including private-brand marketers and large commercial and industrial consumers; about 91 companies in the sale of refined products in the spot market; ten refiners or marketers in the supply of refined products to refiner branded jobbers and dealers; and approximately 252 retailers in the retail sale of refined products. (A jobber is a business that does not carry out refining operations but supplies refiner-branded products to gasoline stations or convenience stores. Dealers refer to retail service station or convenience store operators affiliated with a brand identity.) We compete in the convenience store industry through Speedway’s retail outlets. The retail outlets offer consumers gasoline, diesel fuel (at selected locations) and a broad mix of other merchandise and services. Several nontraditional fuel retailers, such as supermarkets, club stores and mass merchants, have affected the convenience store industry and Energy Analysts International, Inc. estimates such retailers had 12 percent of the U.S. gasoline market in 2010.  Our operating results are affected by price changes in conventional and synthetic crude oil, natural gas and petroleum products, as well as changes in competitive conditions in the markets we serve. Generally, results from production and oil sands mining operations benefit from higher crude oil prices while the refining and wholesale marketing gross margin may be adversely affected by crude oil price increases. Price differentials between sweet and sour crude oil also affect operating results. Market conditions in the oil and gas industry are cyclical and subject to global economic and political events and new and changing governmental regulations.    19    Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Environmental Matters  The Public Policy Committee of our Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing our position on public issues, including environmental matters. Our Corporate Health, Environment, Safety and Security organization has the responsibility to ensure that our operating organizations maintain environmental compliance systems that support and foster our compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Committees comprised of certain of our officers review our overall performance associated with various environmental compliance programs. We also have a Crisis Management Team which oversees our response to any major environmental or other emergency incident involving us or any of our properties.  State, national and international legislation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions are being proposed and, in some cases, promulgated. This legislation applies or could apply in countries in which we operate. Potential legislation and regulations pertaining to climate change could also affect our operations. The cost to comply with these laws and regulations cannot be estimated at this time, but could be significant. For additional information, see Item 1A. Risk Factors. As part of our commitment to environmental stewardship, we estimate and publicly report greenhouse gas emissions from our operations. We are working to continuously improve the accuracy and completeness of these estimates. In addition, we continuously strive to improve operational and energy efficiencies through resource and energy conservation where practicable and cost effective.  Our businesses are also subject to numerous other laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. These environmental laws and regulations include the Clean Air Act (“CAA”) with respect to air emissions, the Clean Water Act (“CWA”) with respect to water discharges, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) with respect to solid and hazardous waste treatment, storage and disposal, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”) with respect to releases and remediation of hazardous substances and the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (“OPA-90”) with respect to oil pollution and response. In addition, many states where we operate have their own similar laws dealing with similar matters. New laws are being enacted, and regulations are being adopted by various regulatory agencies on a continuing basis and the costs of compliance with these new rules can only be broadly appraised until their implementation becomes more accurately defined. In some cases, they can impose liability for the entire cost of clean-up on any responsible party without regard to negligence or fault and impose liability on us for the conduct of others or conditions others have caused, or for our acts that complied with all applicable requirements when we performed them. The ultimate impact of complying with existing laws and regulations is not clearly known or determinable because certain implementing regulations for some environmental laws have not yet been finalized or, in some instances, are undergoing revision. These environmental laws and regulations, particularly the 1990 Amendments to the CAA and its implementing regulations, new water quality requirements and stricter fuel regulations, could result in increased capital, operating and compliance costs.  For a discussion of environmental capital expenditures and costs of compliance for air, water, solid waste and remediation, see Item 3. Legal Proceedings and Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Environmental Matters, Litigation and Contingencies.  Air  The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) is in the process of implementing regulations to address the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (“NAAQS”) for fine particulate emissions and ozone. In connection with these standards, the EPA will designate certain areas as “nonattainment,” meaning that the air quality in such areas does not meet the NAAQS. The proposed rule is directed at electric generating units, not refineries, and is expected to be finalized in 2011. However, we cannot reasonably estimate any final financial impact of the state actions to implement the CATR until the EPA has issued a final rule and states have taken further action to implement that rule.  The EPA is reviewing and is proposing to revise, all NAAQS for criteria air pollutants. In January, 2010, the EPA issued the final nitrogen dioxide standard. In addition, in June 2010, the EPA published the final standard for sulfur dioxide. In December 2010, the EPA announced that the final ozone rule will be completed by July 29, 2011. We cannot reasonably estimate the final financial impact of these revised NAAQS standards until the implementing rules are established and judicial challenges over the revised NAAQS standards are resolved.  Water  We maintain numerous discharge permits as required under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System program of the CWA and have implemented systems to oversee our compliance efforts. In addition, we are regulated under OPA-90, which amended the CWA. Among other requirements, OPA-90 requires the owner or operator of a tank vessel or a facility to maintain an emergency plan to respond to releases of oil or hazardous substances. Also, in case of any such release, OPA-90 requires the responsible company to pay resulting removal costs and damages. OPA-90 also provides for civil penalties and imposes criminal sanctions for violations of its provisions.    20    Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Additionally, OPA-90 requires that new tank vessels entering or operating in U.S. waters be double-hulled and that existing tank vessels that are not double-hulled be retrofitted or removed from U.S. service, according to a phase-out schedule. All of the barges used for river transport of our raw materials and refined products meet the double-hulled requirements of OPA-90. We operate facilities at which spills of oil and hazardous substances could occur. Some coastal states in which we operate have passed state laws similar to OPA-90, but with expanded liability provisions, including provisions for cargo owner responsibility as well as ship owner and operator responsibility. We have implemented emergency oil response plans for all of our components and facilities covered by OPA-90, and we have established Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasures (“SPCC”) plans for facilities subject to CWA SPCC requirements.  Solid Waste  We continue to seek methods to minimize the generation of hazardous wastes in our operations. The RCRA establishes standards for the management of solid and hazardous wastes. Besides affecting waste disposal practices, RCRA also addresses the environmental effects of certain past waste disposal operations, the recycling of wastes and the regulation of underground storage tanks (“USTs”) containing regulated substances. We have ongoing RCRA treatment and disposal operations at one of our RM&T facilities and primarily utilize offsite third-party treatment and disposal facilities.  Remediation  We own or operate certain retail outlets where, during the normal course of operations, releases of refined products from USTs have occurred. Federal and state laws require that contamination caused by such releases at these sites be assessed and remediated to meet applicable standards. The enforcement of the UST regulations under RCRA has been delegated to the states, which administer their own UST programs. Our obligation to remediate such contamination varies, depending on the extent of the releases and the stringency of the laws and regulations of the states in which we operate. A portion of these remediation costs may be recoverable from the appropriate state UST reimbursement funds once the applicable deductibles have been satisfied. We also have other facilities which are subject to remediation under federal or state law. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings – Environmental Proceedings – Other Proceedings for a discussion of these sites.  The AOSP operations use established processes to mine deposits of bitumen from an open-pit mine, extract the bitumen and upgrade it into synthetic crude oils. Tailings are waste products created from the oil sands extraction process which are placed in ponds. The AOSP is required to reclaim its tailing ponds as part of its ongoing reclamation work. The reclamation process uses developing technology and there is an inherent risk that the current process may not be as effective or perform as required in order to meet the approved closure and reclamation plan. The AOSP continues to develop its current reclamation technology and continues to investigate other alternate tailings management technologies. In February 2009, the Alberta Energy Resources Conservation Board (“ERCB”) issued a directive which more clearly defines criteria for managing oil sands tailings. The AOSP Joint Venture Operator submitted tailings management papers to the ERCB (for both mines), that sets forth plans to comply with the Directive and received approval (with conditions) in the second half of 2010. Further new regulations or failure to comply (in a timely manner) could result in additional cost to us.  Other Matters  In 2007, the U.S. Congress passed the Energy Independence and Security Act (“EISA”), which, among other things, sets a target of 35 miles per gallon for the combined fleet of cars and light trucks in the United States by model year 2020, and contains a second Renewable Fuel Standard (“RFS2”). The EPA announced the final RFS2 regulations on February 4, 2010. The RFS2 requires 12.95 billion gallons of renewable fuel usage in 2010, increasing to 36.0 billion gallons by 2022. In the near term, the RFS2 will be satisfied primarily with fuel ethanol blended into gasoline. The RFS2 presents production and logistic challenges for both the fuel ethanol and petroleum refining industries. The RFS2 has required, and will likely in the future continue to require, additional capital expenditures or expenses by us to accommodate increased fuel ethanol use. Within the overall 36.0 billion gallon RFS2, EISA establishes an advanced biofuel RFS2 that begins with 0.95 billion gallons in 2010 and increases to 21.0 billion gallons by 2022. Subsets within the advanced biofuel RFS2 include 1.15 billion gallons of biomass-based diesel in 2010 (due to combining the 2009 and 2010 volumes), which is capped at 1.0 billion gallons starting in 2012, and 0.1 billion gallons of cellulosic biofuel in 2010, increasing to 16.0 billion gallons by 2022. The EPA has determined that 0.1 billion gallons of cellulosic biofuel will not be produced in 2010 and has lowered the requirement to 5.0 million gallons. The advanced biofuels programs will present specific challenges in that we may have to enter into arrangements with other parties to meet our obligations to use advanced biofuels, including biomass-based diesel and cellulosic biofuel, with potentially uncertain supplies of these new fuels. There will be compliance costs and uncertainties regarding how we will comply with the various requirements contained in this law and related regulations. We may experience a decrease in demand for refined petroleum products due to an increase in combined fleet mileage or due to refined petroleum products being replaced by renewable fuels.    21    Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements On October 13, 2010, the EPA issued a partial waiver decision under the CAA to allow for an increase in the amount of ethanol permitted to be blended into gasoline from 10 percent (“E10”) to 15 percent (“E15”) for 2007 and newer light-duty motor vehicles. There are numerous state and federal regulatory issues that would need to be addressed before E15 can be marketed for use in any traditional gasoline engines.  The USX Separation  On December 31, 2001, pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization dated as of July 31, 2001, Marathon completed the USX Separation, in which:        •    its wholly-owned subsidiary United States Steel LLC converted into a Delaware corporation named United States Steel Corporation and became a separate, publicly traded company; and        •    USX Corporation changed its name to Marathon Oil Corporation.  As a result of the USX Separation, Marathon and United States Steel are separate companies and neither has any ownership interest in the other.  In connection with the USX Separation and pursuant to the Plan of Reorganization, Marathon and United States Steel have entered into a series of agreements governing their relationship after the USX Separation and providing for the allocation of tax and certain other liabilities and obligations arising from periods before the USX Separation. The following is a description of the material terms of one of those agreements.  Financial Matters Agreement  Under the financial matters agreement, United States Steel has assumed and agreed to discharge all of our principal repayment, interest payment and other obligations under the following, including any amounts due on any default or acceleration of any of those obligations, other than any default caused by us:        •    obligations under industrial revenue bonds related to environmental projects for current and former U.S. Steel Group facilities, with maturities ranging from 2011 through 2033;        •    sale-leaseback financing obligations under a lease for equipment at United States Steel’s Fairfield Works facility, with a lease term to 2012, subject to extensions;        •    obligations relating to various lease arrangements accounted for as operating leases and various guarantee arrangements, all of which were assumed by United States Steel; and        •    certain other guarantees.  The financial matters agreement also provides that, on or before December 31, 2011, United States Steel will provide for our discharge from any remaining liability under any of the assumed industrial revenue bonds. United States Steel may accomplish that discharge by refinancing or, to the extent not refinanced, paying us an amount equal to the remaining principal amount of all accrued and unpaid debt service outstanding on, and any premium required to immediately retire, the then outstanding industrial revenue bonds.  Under the financial matters agreement, United States Steel has all of the existing contractual rights under the leases assumed from us, including all rights related to purchase options, prepayments or the grant or release of security interests. However, United States Steel has no right to increase amounts due under or lengthen the term of any of the assumed lease obligations without our prior consent other than extensions set forth in the terms of the assumed leases.  The financial matters agreement requires us to use commercially reasonable efforts to assure compliance with all covenants and other obligations to avoid the occurrence of a default or the acceleration of the payments on the assumed obligations.  United States Steel’s obligations to us under the financial matters agreement are general unsecured obligations that rank equal to United States Steel’s accounts payable and other general unsecured obligations. The financial matters agreement does not contain any financial covenants and United States Steel is free to incur additional debt, grant mortgages on or security interests in its property and sell or transfer assets without our consent.  Concentrations of Credit Risk  We are exposed to credit risk in the event of nonpayment by counterparties, a significant portion of which are concentrated in energy-related industries. The creditworthiness of customers and other counterparties is subject to continuing review, including the use of master netting agreements, where appropriate. While no single customer accounts for more than 10 percent of annual revenues, we have exposures to United States Steel arising from the transaction discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements.    22    Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Trademarks, Patents and Licenses  We currently hold a number of U.S. and foreign patents and have various pending patent applications. Although in the aggregate our trademarks, patents and licenses are important to us, we do not regard any single trademark, patent, license or group of related trademarks, patents or licenses as critical or essential to our business as a whole.  Employees  We had 29,677 active employees as of December 31, 2010. Of that number, 19,147 were employees of Speedway, most of whom were employed at our retail marketing outlets.  Certain hourly employees at our Catlettsburg and Canton refineries are represented by the United Steel, Paper and Forestry, Rubber, Manufacturing, Energy, Allied Industrial and Service Workers Union under labor agreements that expire on January 31, 2012. Certain employees at our Texas City refinery are represented by the same union under a labor agreement that expires on March 31, 2012.  The International Brotherhood of Teamsters represents certain hourly employees at our Detroit refinery under a labor agreement that is scheduled to expire on January 31, 2014. They also represent employees at the St. Paul Park refinery under a labor agreement that is scheduled to expire on May 31, 2012. The St. Paul Park Refinery was sold effective December 1, 2010, however there is a transition services agreement in place. Due to this agreement, we remain subject to the labor contracts until the employee transfer date. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 6 for transaction details.

Risk Factors  We are subject to various risks and uncertainties in the course of our business. The following summarizes significant risks and uncertainties that may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.  The proposed spin-off of MPC is contingent upon the satisfaction of a number of conditions, which may not be consummated on the terms or timeline currently contemplated or may not achieve the intended results.  We expect that the spin-off will be effective June 30, 2011. Our ability to timely effect the spin-off is subject to several conditions, including among others, the receipt of a favorable private letter ruling from the IRS, an independent tax opinion that the distribution of one share of MPC common stock for every two shares of Marathon will qualify as tax-free and the SEC declaring effective the registration statement. We cannot assure that we will be able to complete the spin-off in a timely fashion, if at all. For these and other reasons, the spin-off may not be completed on the terms or timeline contemplated. Further, if the spin-off is completed, it may not achieve the intended results. Any such difficulties could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.  The spin-off could result in substantial tax liability.  We have requested a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) substantially to the effect that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the spin-off and certain related transactions will qualify under Sections 355 and/or 368 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). If the factual assumptions or representations made in the request for the private letter ruling prove to have been inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect, then we will not be able to rely on the ruling. Furthermore, the IRS does not rule on whether a distribution such as the spin-off satisfies certain requirements necessary to obtain tax-free treatment under section 355 of the Code. The private letter ruling will be based on representations by us that those requirements were satisfied, and any inaccuracy in those representations could invalidate the ruling. In connection with the spin-off, we also intend to obtain an opinion of outside counsel, substantially to the effect that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the spin-off and certain related transactions will qualify under Sections 355 and 368 of the Code. The opinion will rely on, among other things, the continuing validity of the private letter ruling and various assumptions and representations as to factual matters made by us which, if inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect, would jeopardize the conclusions reached by such counsel in its opinion. The opinion will not be binding on the IRS or the courts, and there can be no assurance that the IRS or the courts would not challenge the conclusions stated in the opinion or that any such challenge would not prevail.  A substantial or extended decline in liquid hydrocarbon or natural gas prices, or in refining and wholesale marketing gross margins, would reduce our operating results and cash flows and could adversely impact our future rate of growth and the carrying value of our assets.  Prices for liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas and refining and wholesale marketing gross margins fluctuate widely. Our revenues, operating results and future rate of growth are highly dependent on the prices we receive for our liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas and the margins we realize on our refined products. Historically, the markets for liquid hydrocarbons, natural gas and refined products have been volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future. Many of the factors influencing prices of liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas and refining and wholesale marketing gross margins are beyond our control. These factors include:        •    worldwide and domestic supplies of and demand for liquid hydrocarbons, natural gas and refined products;        •    the cost of exploring for, developing and producing liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas;        •    the cost of crude oil to be manufactured into refined products;        •    utilization rates of refineries;    24    Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements     •    natural gas and electricity supply costs incurred by refineries;        •    the ability of the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (“OPEC”) to agree to and maintain production controls;        •    political instability or armed conflict in oil and natural gas producing regions;        •    changes in weather patterns and climate;        •    natural disasters such as hurricanes and tornados;        •    the price and availability of alternative and competing forms of energy;        •    domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes; and        •    general economic conditions worldwide.  The long-term effects of these and other factors on the prices of liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas, as well as on refining and wholesale marketing gross margins, are uncertain.  Lower liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas prices, may cause us to reduce the amount of these commodities that we produce, which may reduce our revenues, operating income and cash flows. Significant reductions in liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas prices or refining and wholesale marketing gross margins could require us to reduce our capital expenditures or impair the carrying value of our assets.  Our offshore operations involve special risks that could negatively impact us.  Offshore exploration and development operations present technological challenges and operating risks because of the marine environment. Activities in deepwater areas may pose incrementally greater risks because of water depths that limit intervention capability and the physical distance to oilfield service infrastructure and service providers. Environmental remediation and other costs resulting from spills or releases may result in substantial liabilities and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and market value of our securities.  Estimates of liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserves depend on many factors and assumptions, including various assumptions that are based on conditions in existence as of the dates of the estimates. Any material changes in those conditions or other factors affecting those assumptions could impair the quantity and value of our liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserves.  The proved reserve information included in this report has been derived from engineering estimates. Estimates of liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves were prepared by our in-house teams of reservoir engineers and geoscience professionals and were reviewed, on a selected basis, by our Corporate Reserves Group or third-party consultants. The synthetic crude oil reserves estimates were prepared by GLJ Petroleum Consultants, a third-party consulting firm experienced in working with oil sands. Reserves were priced at the unweighted average of closing prices for the first day of each month in the 12-month period ended December 31, 2010, as well as other conditions in existence at the date. Any significant future price changes will have a material effect on the quantity and present value of our proved reserves. Future reserve revisions could also result from changes in governmental regulation, among other things.  Reserve estimation is a subjective process that involves estimating volumes to be recovered from underground accumulations of liquid hydrocarbons, natural gas and bitumen that cannot be directly measured. (Bitumen is mined then upgraded into synthetic crude oil.) Estimates of economically producible reserves and of future net cash flows depend upon a number of variable factors and assumptions, including:        •    location, size and shape of the accumulation as well as fluid, rock and producing characteristics of the accumulation;        •    historical production from the area, compared with production from other comparable producing areas;        •    volumes of bitumen in-place and various factors affecting the recoverability of bitumen and its conversion into synthetic crude oil such as historical upgrader performance;        •    the assumed effects of regulation by governmental agencies;        •    assumptions concerning future operating costs, severance and excise taxes, development costs and workover and repair costs, and        •    industry economic conditions, levels of cash flows from operations and other operating considerations.    25    Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements As a result, different petroleum engineers, each using industry-accepted geologic and engineering practices and scientific methods, may produce different estimates of proved reserves and future net cash flows based on the same available data. Because of the subjective nature of such reserve estimates, each of the following items may differ materially from the amounts or other factors estimated:        •    the amount and timing of production;        •    the revenues and costs associated with that production; and        •    the amount and timing of future development expenditures.  The discounted future net revenues from our proved liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserves reflected in this report should not be considered as the market value of the reserves attributable to our properties. As required by SEC Rule 4-10 of Regulation S-X, the estimated discounted future net revenues from our proved liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserves are based on an unweighted average of closing prices for the first day of each month in the 12-month period ended December 31, 2009, and costs applicable at the date of the estimate, while actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower.  In addition, the 10 percent discount factor required by the applicable rules of the SEC to be used to calculate discounted future net revenues for reporting purposes is not necessarily the most appropriate discount factor based on our cost of capital and the risks associated with our business and the oil and natural gas industry in general.  If we are unsuccessful in acquiring or finding additional reserves, our future liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas production would decline, thereby reducing our cash flows and results of operations and impairing our financial condition.  The rate of production from liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas properties generally declines as reserves are depleted. Except to the extent we acquire interests in additional properties containing proved reserves, conduct successful exploration and development activities or, through engineering studies, optimize production performance, identify additional reservoirs not currently producing or secondary recovery reserves, our proved reserves will decline materially as liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas are produced. Accordingly, to the extent we are not successful in replacing the liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas we produce, our future revenues will decline. Creating and maintaining an inventory of prospects for future production depends on many factors, including:        •    obtaining rights to explore for, develop and produce liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas in promising areas;        •    drilling success;        •    the ability to complete long lead-time, capital-intensive projects timely and on budget;        •    the ability to find or acquire additional proved reserves at acceptable costs; and        •    the ability to fund such activity.  The availability of crude oil and increases in crude oil prices may reduce our refining, marketing and transportation profitability and refining and wholesale marketing gross margins.  The profitability of our refining, marketing and transportation operations depends largely on the margin between the cost of crude oil and other feedstocks that we refine and the selling prices we obtain for refined products. We are a net purchaser of crude oil. A significant portion of our crude oil is purchased from various foreign national oil companies, producing companies and trading companies, including suppliers from the Middle East. These purchases are subject to political, geographic and economic risks and possible terrorist activities attendant to doing business with suppliers located in that area of the world. Our overall refining, marketing and transportation profitability could be adversely affected by the availability of supply and rising crude oil and other feedstock prices which we do not recover in the marketplace. Refining and wholesale marketing gross margins historically have been volatile and vary with the level of economic activity in the various marketing areas, the regulatory climate, logistical capabilities and the available supply of refined products.  Restrictions on U.S. Gulf of Mexico deepwater operations and similar action by countries where we do business could have a significant impact on our operations.  Although the deepwater drilling moratorium imposed by the U.S. Department of the Interior suspending outer continental shelf subsea and floating facility operations was lifted on October 12, 2010, we cannot predict when necessary plans and permits will be approved for renewed offshore drilling activity other than completions, interventions and workovers. An extended regulatory delay on other deepwater drilling activities in the Gulf of Mexico or changes in laws or    26    Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements  regulations affecting our operations in these areas could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and market value of our securities. In addition, other countries where we do business may make changes to their laws or regulations governing offshore operations, including deepwater areas that could have a similar material adverse effect.  We may incur substantial capital expenditures and operating costs as a result of compliance with, and changes in environmental health, safety and security laws and regulations, and, as a result, our business, financial condition, results of operation and cash flow could be materially and adversely affected.  Our businesses are subject to numerous laws, regulations and other requirements relating to the protection of the environment, including those relating to the discharge of materials into the environment, waste management, pollution prevention, greenhouse gas emissions, and characteristics and composition of gasoline and diesel fuels, as well as laws and regulations relating to public and employee safety and health and to facility security. We have incurred and may continue to incur substantial capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures as a result of these laws and regulations. To the extent these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services, our operating results will be adversely affected. The specific impact of these laws and regulations may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of operating facilities, marketing areas, crude oil and feedstock sources, and production processes. We may also be required to make material expenditures to modify operations, install pollution control equipment, perform site cleanups or curtail operations that could materially and adversely affect business, financial condition, results of operation and cash flows. We may become subject to liabilities that we currently do not anticipate in connection with new, amended or more stringent requirements, stricter interpretations of existing requirements or the future discovery of contamination. In addition, any failure by us to comply with existing or future laws or regulations could result in civil penalties or criminal fines and other enforcement actions against us.  We believe it is likely that the scientific and political attention to issues concerning the extent, causes of and responsibility for climate change will continue, with the potential for further regulations that could affect our operations. Currently, various legislative and regulatory measures to address greenhouse gas emissions (including carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxides) are in various phases of review, discussion or implementation in countries where we operate: the United States, Canada, European Union (“EU”) and Norway. Our operations result in these greenhouse gas emissions and emissions also arise from the use of our refined petroleum products by our customers. Through 2010, these included proposed federal legislation and state actions to develop statewide or regional programs, each of which could impose reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. These actions could result in increased: (1) costs to operate and maintain our facilities, (2) capital expenditures to install new emission controls at our refineries and other facilities, and (3) costs to administer and manage any potential greenhouse gas emissions or carbon trading or tax programs or to produce fuels to meet low-carbon fuel standards. These costs and capital expenditures could be material. Although uncertain, these developments could increase our costs, reduce the demand for the products we sell, reduce the supply of crude oils which can be used and create delays in our obtaining air pollution permits for new or modified facilities. Legislation or regulatory activity that impacts or could impact our operations includes:        •    EPA issued a finding that greenhouse gases contribute to air pollution that endangers public health and welfare. In April of 2010, the EPA finalized a greenhouse gas emission standard for mobile sources (cars and light duty vehicles). The endangerment finding, along with the mobile source standard, and EPA’s determination that greenhouse gases are subject to regulation under the CAA, will lead to widespread regulation of stationary sources of greenhouse gas emissions. As a result, the EPA has issued a so-called tailoring rule to limit the applicability of the EPA’s major permitting programs to larger sources of greenhouse gas emissions, such as our refineries and a few large production facilities. Although legal challenges have been filed against these EPA actions, no court decisions are expected for another year or more and the EPA permitting requirements will apply to our larger facilities starting in January 2011. EPA has also announced its plan to develop refining sector new source performance standards for greenhouse gas emissions with standards to be proposed in December 2011 and final standards to be adopted in December 2012.        •    In the U.S., the House of Representatives and the Senate each had their own form of cap-and-trade legislation to reduce carbon emissions in the Congressional session ending in 2010. The House approved the Waxman-Markey Bill in 2009 and the Senate considered but did not approve any such legislation. Similar legislation may be introduced in 2011 in the new Congressional session or the legislation may seek to limit or delay implementation of the EPA greenhouse gas emission requirements. Among other actions, cap and trade systems require businesses that emit greenhouse gases to buy emission credits from the government, other businesses, or through an auction process.        •    Although not ratified in the United States, the Kyoto Protocol, effective in 2005, has been ratified by countries in which we have or in the future may have operations.        •    The non-binding Copenhagen Accord was reached in 2009 with the United States pledging to reduce emissions 17 percent below 2005 levels by 2020.    27    Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements     •    The Canadian federal government has not enacted greenhouse gas emission reduction legislation although in signing the Copenhagen Accord, reaffirmed its commitment to reduce the country’s emissions 17 percent from 2005 levels by 2020. Alberta enacted legislation effective in 2007 which requires large emission sources such as oil sands facilities to reduce their net emissions intensity by 12 percent as measured against their baseline emissions. Sources may also comply by making a compliance obligation payment or by purchasing verifiable offsets.        •    The European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (“EU ETS”) is in its second phase which runs from 2008 to 2012, in which EU member governments provide a certain number of free allowances to facilities and a facility may purchase additional EU allowances from other facilities, traders and the government. For, 2010, our EU facilities have complied with the EU ETS by using the allocated free allowances. Norway, as a member of the European Economic Area, while not in the European Union, has a carbon tax and also participates in the EU ETS. For 2010, our Norway facilities complied with the EU ETS by purchasing carbon allowances in the market.        •    The Canadian federal government and province of Alberta jointly announced their intent to partially fund the AOSP’s Quest Carbon Capture and Storage (“Quest CCS”) project. Under the terms of their letters of intent, Alberta would contribute 745 million Canadian dollars and the Government of Canada would provide 120 million Canadian dollars toward the project’s development. The Quest project would store approximately 1.1 million tons of carbon dioxide annually and should allow the AOSP to meet Canadian and Alberta emission reduction requirements for the foreseeable future. The operator intends to finalize the government funding agreements in the first quarter of 2011. A final investment decision on the Quest CCS project will be made at a later date, and is subject to regulatory approvals, stakeholder engagement, detailed engineering studies, as well as the agreement of joint venture partners.        •    The State of California enacted legislation effective in 2007 capping California’s greenhouse gas emissions at 1990 levels by 2020 and is implementing this legislation through a low-carbon fuel standard and a cap-and-trade program. The low-carbon fuel standard is being challenged in court. New Mexico has adopted a regulation which would reduce greenhouse gas emissions from current levels by three percent annually starting in 2012. We have not conducted significant business in California in recent years and discontinued operations in New Mexico in 2009, but other states where we have operations could adopt similar greenhouse gas limitations.  Although there may be adverse financial impact (including compliance costs, potential permitting delays and potential reduced demand for crude oil or certain refined products) associated with any legislation, regulation, the EPA or other action, the extent and magnitude of that impact cannot be reliably or accurately estimated due to the fact that requirements have only recently been adopted and the present uncertainty regarding the additional measures and how they will be implemented. Private party litigation has also been brought against emitters of greenhouse gas emissions, but we have not been named in those cases.  If we are unable to complete capital projects at their expected costs and in a timely manner, or if the market conditions assumed in our project economics deteriorate, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.  Delays or cost increases related to capital spending programs involving engineering, procurement and construction of facilities (including improvements and repairs to our existing facilities) could adversely affect our ability to achieve forecasted internal rates of return and operating results. Delays in making required changes or upgrades to our facilities could subject us to fines or penalties as well as affect our ability to supply certain products we produce. Such delays or cost increases may arise as a result of unpredictable factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:        •    denial of or delay in receiving requisite regulatory approvals and /or permits;        •    unplanned increases in the cost of construction materials or labor;        •    disruptions in transportation of components or construction materials;        •    adverse weather conditions, natural disasters or other events (such as equipment malfunctions, explosions, fires or spills) affecting our facilities, or those of vendors or suppliers;        •    shortages of sufficiently skilled labor, or labor disagreements resulting in unplanned work stoppages;        •    market-related increases in a project’s debt or equity financing costs; and        •    nonperformance by, or disputes with, vendors, suppliers, contractors or subcontractors.  Any one or more of these factors could have a significant impact on our ongoing capital projects. If we were unable to make up the delays associated with such factors or to recover the related costs, or if market conditions change, it could materially and adversely affect our business, financial conditions, results of operations and cash flows.    28    Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Many of our major projects and operations are conducted with partners, which may decrease our ability to manage risk.  We often enter into arrangements to conduct certain business operations, such oil and gas exploration and production, oil sands mining or pipeline transportation, with partners in order to share risks associated with those operations. However, these arrangements also may decrease our ability to manage risks and costs, particularly where we are not the operator. We could have limited influence over and control of the behaviors and performance of these operations. This could affect our operational performance, financial position and reputation.  Financial market uncertainty could impact our ability to obtain future financing.  In the future we may require financing to grow our business. Financial institutions participate in our revolving credit facility and provide us with services including insurance, cash management, commercial letters of credit, derivative instruments, and short-term investments. A deterioration of the financial market conditions could significantly increase our costs associated with borrowing. Our liquidity and our ability to access the credit and/or capital markets could also be adversely affected by changes in the financial markets and the global economy.  Worldwide political and economic developments could damage our operations and materially reduce our profitability and cash flows.  Local political and economic factors in global markets could have a material adverse effect on us. A total of 67 percent of our liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas sales volumes in 2010 was derived from production outside the United States and 72 percent of our proved liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves as of December 31, 2010, were located outside the United States. All of our synthetic crude oil production and proved reserves are located in Canada. In addition, a significant portion of the feedstock requirements for our refineries is satisfied through supplies originating in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Canada, Mexico and various other foreign countries. We are, therefore, subject to the political, geographic and economic risks and possible terrorist activities attendant to doing business with suppliers located in, and supplies originating from, those areas. There are many risks associated with operations in countries and in global markets, such as Equatorial Guinea, Indonesia, Libya and the Iraqi Kurdistan Region, including        •    changes in governmental policies relating to liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas, bitumen, synthetic crude oil or refined product pricing and taxation;        •    other political, economic or diplomatic developments and international monetary fluctuations;        •    political and economic instability, war, acts of terrorism and civil disturbances;        •    the possibility that a government may seize our property with or without compensation, may attempt to renegotiate or revoke existing contractual arrangements or may impose additional taxes or royalty burdens; and        •    fluctuating currency values, hard currency shortages and currency controls.  In recent weeks, civil unrest, which began in Tunisia, has spread to other parts of North Africa and the Middle East. There have been demonstrations by protestors demanding regime changes in countries such as Egypt, Libya, Yemen and Bahrain. Some of these demonstrations have been violent particularly in Libya where we have operations. If such unrest continues to spread, conflicts could result in civil wars, regional conflicts, and regime changes resulting in governments that are hostile to the United States. These may have the following results, among others:        •    Volatility in global crude oil prices which could negatively impact the global economy, resulting in slower economic growth rates and reduced demand for our products;        •    Negative impact on the world crude oil supply if transportation avenues are disrupted;        •    Security concerns leading to the prolonged evacuation of our personnel;        •    Damage to, or the inability to access, production facilities or other operating assets;        •    Inability of our service and equipment providers to deliver items necessary for us to conduct our operations; and        •    Imposition of trade sanctions by the U.S. government on Libya.  Continued hostilities in the Middle East and the occurrence or threat of future terrorist attacks could adversely affect the economies of the United States and other developed countries. A lower level of economic activity could result in a decline in energy consumption, which could cause our revenues and margins to decline and limit our future growth prospects. These risks could lead to increased volatility in prices for liquid hydrocarbons, natural gas and refined products. In addition, these risks could increase instability in the financial and insurance markets and make it more difficult for us to access capital and to obtain the insurance coverage that we consider adequate.    29    Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Actions of governments through tax and other legislation, executive order and commercial restrictions could reduce our operating profitability, both in the United States and abroad. The U.S. government can prevent or restrict us from doing business in foreign countries. These restrictions and those of foreign governments have in the past limited our ability to operate in, or gain access to, opportunities in various countries and will continue to do so in the future.  Our operations are subject to business interruptions and casualty losses. We do not insure against all potential losses and therefore we could be seriously harmed by unexpected liabilities and increased costs.  Our exploration and production operations are subject to unplanned occurrences, including blowouts, explosions, fires, loss of well control, spills, hurricanes and other adverse weather, labor disputes and accidents. Our oil sands mining operations are subject to business interruptions due to breakdown or failure of equipment or processes and unplanned events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions or other interruptions. In addition, our refining, marketing and transportation operations are subject to business interruptions due to scheduled refinery turnarounds and unplanned events such as explosions, fires, pipeline ruptures or other interruptions, crude oil or refined product spills, severe weather and labor disputes. These same risks can be applied to the third-parties which transport crude oil and refined products to, from and among facilities. A prolonged disruption in the ability of any pipeline or vessels to transport crude oil or refined products could contribute to a business interruption or increase costs.  Our operations are also subject to the additional hazards of pollution, releases of toxic gas and other environmental hazards and risks, as well as hazards of marine operations, such as capsizing, collision, acts of piracy and damage or loss from severe weather conditions. These hazards could result in serious personal injury or loss of human life, significant damage to property and equipment, environmental pollution, impairment of operations and substantial losses to us. Various hazards have adversely affected us in the past, and damages resulting from a catastrophic occurrence in the future involving us or any of our assets or operations may result in our being named as a defendant in one or more lawsuits asserting potentially large claims or in our being assessed potentially substantial fines by governmental authorities. We maintain insurance against many, but not all, potential losses or liabilities arising from operating hazards in amounts that we believe to be prudent. Uninsured losses and liabilities arising from operating hazards could reduce the funds available to us for capital, exploration and investment spending and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Historically, we have maintained insurance coverage for physical damage and resulting business interruption to our major onshore and offshore facilities, with significant self-insured retentions. In the future, we may not be able to maintain or obtain insurance of the type and amount we desire at reasonable rates. As a result of market conditions, premiums and deductibles for certain of our insurance policies have increased substantially and could escalate further. In some instances, certain insurance could become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. For example, due to hurricane activity in recent years, the availability of insurance coverage for our offshore facilities for windstorms in the Gulf of Mexico region has been reduced or, in many instances, it is prohibitively expensive. As a result, our exposure to losses from future windstorm activity in the Gulf of Mexico region has increased.  Litigation by private plaintiffs or government officials could adversely affect our performance.  We currently are defending litigation and anticipate that we will be required to defend new litigation in the future. The subject matter of such litigation may include releases of hazardous substances from our facilities, products liability, consumer credit or privacy laws, product pricing or antitrust laws or any other laws or regulations that apply to our operations. While an adverse outcome in most litigation matters would not be expected to be material to us, in some cases the plaintiff or plaintiffs seek alleged damages involving large classes of potential litigants, and may allege damages relating to extended periods of time or other alleged facts and circumstances. If we are not able to successfully defend such claims, they may result in substantial liability. We do not have insurance covering all of these potential liabilities. There has been a trend in recent years of litigation by attorneys general and other government officials seeking to recover civil damages from companies. We are defending litigation of that type and anticipate that we will be required to defend new litigation of that type in the future. In addition to substantial liability, litigation may also seek injunctive relief which could have an adverse effect on our future operations.  We may issue preferred stock whose terms could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of Marathon common stock.  Our restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such preferences, powers and relative, participating, optional and other rights, including preferences over Marathon common stock respecting dividends and distributions, as our Board of Directors generally may determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of Marathon common stock. For example, we could grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the common stock.    30    Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Item 1B.
