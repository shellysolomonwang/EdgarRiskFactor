PART I      Item 1. Business  General  Marathon Oil Corporation was originally organized in 2001 as USX HoldCo, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the former USX Corporation. As a result of a reorganization completed in July 2001, USX HoldCo, Inc. (1) became the parent entity of the consolidated enterprise (the former USX Corporation was merged into a subsidiary of USX HoldCo, Inc.) and (2) changed its name to USX Corporation. In connection with the transaction described in the next paragraph (the “USX Separation”), USX Corporation changed its name to Marathon Oil Corporation.  Before December 31, 2001, Marathon had two outstanding classes of common stock: USX-Marathon Group common stock, which was intended to reflect the performance of our energy business, and USX-U.S. Steel Group common stock (“Steel Stock”), which was intended to reflect the performance of our steel business. On December 31, 2001, we disposed of our steel business through a tax-free distribution of the common stock of our wholly-owned subsidiary United States Steel Corporation (“United States Steel”) to holders of Steel Stock in exchange for all outstanding shares of Steel Stock on a one-for-one basis.  In connection with the USX Separation, our certificate of incorporation was amended on December 31, 2001, and Marathon has had only one class of common stock authorized since that date.  On June 30, 2005, we acquired the 38 percent ownership interest in Marathon Ashland Petroleum LLC (“MAP”) previously held by Ashland Inc. (“Ashland”). In addition, we acquired a portion of Ashland’s Valvoline Instant Oil Change business, its maleic anhydride business, its interest in LOOP LLC which owns and operates the only U.S. deepwater oil port, and its interest in LOCAP LLC which owns a crude oil pipeline. As a result of the transactions, MAP is wholly owned by Marathon and its name was changed to Marathon Petroleum Company LLC (“MPC”) effective September 1, 2005.  On October 18, 2007, we acquired all the outstanding shares of Western Oil Sands Inc. (“Western”). Western’s primary asset was a 20 percent outside-operated interest in the Athabasca Oil Sands Project (“AOSP”), an oil sands mining joint venture located in the province of Alberta, Canada. The acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and, as such, our results of operations include Western’s results from October 18, 2007. Western’s oil sands mining and bitumen upgrading operations are reported as a separate Oil Sands Mining segment, while its ownership interests in leases where in-situ recovery techniques are expected to be utilized are included in the Exploration and Production segment.    2    Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Segment and Geographic Information  Our operations consist of four reportable operating segments: 1) Exploration and Production (“E&P”) – explores for, produces and markets liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas on a worldwide basis; 2) Oil Sands Mining (“OSM”) – mines, extracts and transports bitumen from oil sands deposits in Alberta, Canada, and upgrades the bitumen to produce and market synthetic crude oil and by-products; 3) Refining, Marketing and Transportation (“RM&T”) – refines, markets and transports crude oil and petroleum products, primarily in the Midwest, upper Great Plains, Gulf Coast and southeastern regions of the United States; and 4) Integrated Gas (“IG”) – markets and transports products manufactured from natural gas, such as liquefied natural gas (“LNG”) and methanol, on a worldwide basis, and is developing other projects to link stranded natural gas resources with key demand areas. For operating segment and geographic financial information, see Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements.  Exploration and Production  In the discussion that follows regarding our exploration and production operations, references to “net” wells, sales or investment indicate our ownership interest or share, as the context requires.  We conduct exploration, development and production activities in ten countries: the United States, Angola, Canada, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Indonesia, Ireland, Libya, Norway and the United Kingdom.  Our 2008 worldwide net liquid hydrocarbon sales averaged 211 thousand barrels per day (“mbpd”). Our 2008 worldwide net natural gas sales, including natural gas acquired for injection and subsequent resale, averaged 1,016 million cubic feet per day (“mmcfd”). In total, our 2008 worldwide net sales averaged 381 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (“mboepd”). For purposes of determining barrels of oil equivalent (“boe”), natural gas volumes are converted to approximate liquid hydrocarbon barrels by dividing the natural gas volumes expressed in thousands of cubic feet (“mcf”) by six. The liquid hydrocarbon volume is added to the barrel equivalent of natural gas volume to obtain boe.  Exploration  In the United States during 2008, we drilled 71 gross (48 net) exploratory wells of which 60 gross (42 net) wells encountered commercial quantities of hydrocarbons. Of these 60 wells, 3 were temporarily suspended or in the process of being completed at year end. Internationally, we drilled 12 gross (3 net) exploratory wells of which 11 gross (3 net) wells encountered commercial quantities of hydrocarbons. Of these 11 wells, 5 gross (1 net) wells were temporarily suspended or were in the process of being completed at December 31, 2008.  United States – The Gulf of Mexico continues to be a core area. At the end of 2008, we had interests in 103 blocks in the Gulf of Mexico, including 97 in the deepwater area. We have been awarded 42 blocks on which we were the high bidder in the federal Outer Continental Shelf Lease Sales No. 205 and 206 conducted by the U.S. Minerals Management Service (“MMS”) in late 2007 and early 2008. Our initial net investment in these blocks was $343 million. We own 100 percent of fifteen of the blocks. We acquired the remaining blocks in conjunction with partners. Our plans call for initial drilling on some of these leases in 2009 and 2010.  In 2008, a successful appraisal well was drilled on the Stones prospect located on Walker Ridge Block 508 after a 2005 discovery. We hold a 25 percent outside-operated interest in the Stones prospect. In the third quarter of 2008, we announced a Gulf of Mexico deepwater discovery on the Gunflint prospect located on Mississippi Canyon Block 948. We own a 13 percent outside-operated interest in the prospect. In the first quarter of 2009, we participated in a deepwater discovery on the Shenandoah prospect located on Walker Ridge Block 52. We own a 20 percent outside-operated interest in the prospect.  In 2008, we successfully completed our first horizontal well in the Woodford Shale resource play in the Anadarko Basin of Oklahoma. We are currently participating in additional horizontal wells in the area where we hold 30,000 net acres.  We hold acreage in two additional emerging shale resource plays in the U.S. In the Appalachian Basin we hold 65,000 net acres in the Marcellus Shale resource play in Pennsylvania and West Virginia. We hold 25,000 net acres, primarily in Texas, in the Haynesville Shale resource play located in north Louisiana and east Texas. Initial drilling on some of these leases is planned for 2009.  Angola – Offshore Angola, we hold a 10 percent outside-operated interest in Block 31 and a 30 percent outside-operated interest in Block 32. Through December 2008, 28 discoveries on these blocks have been announced, including the Portia and Dione discoveries on Angola Block 31 in 2008.    3    Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Norway – We hold interests in over 510,000 gross acres offshore Norway, including production license 505 (“PL 505”) that was awarded in January 2009. In 2009, exploration drilling is expected to commence on additional prospects with the potential to be tied back to the Alvheim complex.  Indonesia – We are the operator and hold a 70 percent interest in the Pasangkayu Block offshore Indonesia. The 1.2 million acre block is located mostly in deep water, predominantly offshore of the island of Sulawesi in the Makassar Strait, directly east of the Kutei Basin production region. The production sharing contract with the Indonesian government was signed in 2006 and we completed 3D seismic acquisition in May 2008. We expect to begin exploratory drilling in early 2010. Additionally, in October 2008, we were granted a 49 percent interest and operatorship in the Bone Bay Block offshore Indonesia. The Bone Bay Block is 200 miles southeast of our Pasangkayu Block. Current exploration plans for Bone Bay call for the acquisition of seismic data starting in 2010, followed by drilling in 2011.  We are the operator of a drilling rig consortium that has secured a two-year contract for a deepwater exploration drilling rig. The rig will be used for deepwater exploration activities by us and by five other companies in Indonesia. The participants have the right to extend this rig commitment.  We continue to participate in joint study agreements in Indonesia, which provide a right of first refusal in future bid rounds. We completed two joint study agreements in 2008.  Equatorial Guinea – During 2004, we announced the Deep Luba and Gardenia discoveries on the Alba Block, in which we hold a 63 percent operated interest, and the Corona well on Block D, where we are the operator with a 90 percent interest. These wells are part of our long-term LNG strategy. We expect these discoveries to be developed when the natural gas supply from the nearby Alba Field starts to decline.  Libya – We hold a 16 percent outside-operated interest in the Waha concessions, which encompass almost 13 million acres located in the Sirte Basin. Our exploration program in 2008 included the drilling of three wells, all of which were successful. Most of these discoveries extended previously defined hydrocarbon accumulations.  Canada – We hold interests in both operated and outside-operated exploration-stage in-situ oil sand leases as a result of the acquisition of Western in 2007. Initial test drilling on the 100 percent interest Birchwood prospect positively confirmed bitumen presence with additional test drilling required to confirm reservoir quality.  United Kingdom – We have a 45 percent interest in five exploratory U.K. onshore coal seam gas (“CSG”) licenses. Drilling has been completed in five exploration wells in three of the licenses. One test well was completed in 2007 and three lateral wells for production testing were drilled in 2008. We and our partners were awarded 11 new blocks for CSG exploration and potential future development during the 13th Onshore Licensing Round in 2008. After the 2008 licensing our interest covers 520,000 acres. We are the operator of these new licenses and have a 55 percent working interest.  Production (including development activities)  United States – Our U.S. operations accounted for 30 percent of our 2008 worldwide net liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes and 44 percent of our worldwide net natural gas sales volumes.  During 2008, our net sales in the Gulf of Mexico averaged 23 mbpd of liquid hydrocarbons, representing 36 percent of our total U.S. net liquid hydrocarbon sales, and 20 mmcfd of natural gas, representing five percent of our total U.S. net natural gas sales. At year end 2008, we held interests in six producing fields and five platforms in the Gulf of Mexico, of which we operate one platform.  Hurricanes Gustav and Ike impacted Gulf of Mexico operations in the latter part of the third quarter of 2008, resulting in approximately 9.5 net mboepd being shut-in during the quarter. The Ewing Bank development resumed production in October 2008, but the outside-operated Ursa and Troika fields were shut-in for repairs until November 2008 and January 2009, respectively, impacting fourth quarter sales by approximately 7 mboepd. We have a 65 percent working interest in Ewing Bank, a four percent overriding royalty interest in Ursa and a 50 percent working interest in Troika.  We own a 50 percent outside-operated interest in the Petronius field on Viosca Knoll Blocks 786 and 830. The Petronius platform also provides processing and transportation services to adjacent third-party fields. For example, Petronius processes liquid hydrocarbons from our Perseus field which commenced production in April 2005 and is located five miles from the platform.    4    Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The Neptune development in the Gulf of Mexico commenced production of liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas in July 2008. We hold a 30 percent outside-operated working interest in this development located on Atwater Valley area in the Gulf of Mexico, 120 miles off the coast of Louisiana. The development plan included seven subsea wells tied back to a stand-alone platform and six wells have been drilled and completed.  In October 2008, development of the Droshky discovery, located in the Gulf of Mexico on Green Canyon Block 244, was authorized by our board of directors. The initial Droshky discovery well and two sidetracks were drilled in 2007, followed in 2008 by a second delineation and sidetrack well. The project will consist of development wells, which will be tied back to the nearby third-party owned and operated Bullwinkle platform. We have secured a rig to begin drilling in 2009, and first production is targeted for 2010. Net sales after royalties are expected to peak at about 45 mbpd of liquid hydrocarbons and 43 mmcfd of natural gas. We hold a 100 percent working interest in Droshky.  Also in October 2008, development of the Ozona prospect, located in the Gulf of Mexico on Garden Banks Block 515 was authorized by our board of directors. We have secured a rig to complete the previously drilled appraisal well and tie back to the nearby outside-operated Auger platform. First production is expected in 2011. We hold a 68 percent working interest in Ozona.  We produce natural gas in the Cook Inlet and adjacent Kenai Peninsula of Alaska. In 2008, our net natural gas sales from Alaska averaged 126 mmcfd, representing 28 percent of our total U.S. net natural gas sales volumes. Our natural gas sales from Alaska are seasonal in nature, trending down during the second and third quarters of each year and increasing during the fourth and first quarters. To manage supplies to meet contractual demand we produce and store natural gas in a partially depleted reservoir in the Kenai natural gas field.  Net liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas sales from our Wyoming fields averaged 19 mbpd and 123 mmcfd in 2008. Our Wyoming net natural gas sales decreased from the prior year primarily as a result of natural field declines, partially offset by new wells in the Wamsutter Field and Powder River Basin areas. Development of the Powder River Basin continued in 2008 with 100 operated wells drilled, which was down from the 170 wells drilled in 2007. Additional development of our southwest Wyoming interests continued in 2008 where we participated in the drilling of six wells.  We also have domestic natural gas operations in Oklahoma, east Texas and north Louisiana, with combined net sales of 137 mmcfd in 2008, and liquid hydrocarbon operations in the Permian Basin of southeast New Mexico and west Texas, with net sales of 11 mbpd in 2008.  We hold 320,000 acres in the Williston Basin (the Bakken Shale resource play). The majority of the acreage is located in North Dakota with the remainder in eastern Montana. This represents a substantial position in the Bakken Shale where approximately 225 locations will be drilled over the next four to five years. We currently have four operated drilling rigs running and ended 2008 with December average net sales of 8.2 mboepd.  We hold leases with natural gas production in the Piceance Basin of Colorado, located in Garfield County in the Greater Grand Valley field complex. Our plans include drilling approximately 150 wells over the next five years. Drilling and production commenced in late 2007. We currently have one operated drilling rig running and ended 2008 with December average net sales of 10 mmcfd.  United Kingdom – Our largest asset in the U.K. sector of the North Sea is the Brae area complex where we are the operator and have a 42 percent working interest in the South, Central, North and West Brae fields and a 38 percent working interest in the East Brae field. The Brae A platform and facilities host the underlying South Brae field and the adjacent Central and West Brae fields. The North Brae field, which is produced via the Brae B platform, and the East Brae field, which is produced via the East Brae platform, are natural gas condensate fields. The East Brae platform hosts the nearby Braemar field in which we have a 26 percent working interest. Net liquid hydrocarbon sales from the Brae area averaged 12 mbpd in 2008. Net Brae natural gas sales averaged 119 mmcfd, or 21 percent, of our international natural gas sales volumes in 2008.  The strategic location of the Brae platforms along with pipeline and onshore infrastructure has generated third-party processing and transportation business since 1986. Currently, the operators of 28 third-party fields have contracted to use the Brae system. In addition to generating processing and pipeline tariff revenue, this third-party business also has a favorable impact on Brae area operations by optimizing infrastructure usage and extending the economic life of the complex.  The Brae group owns a 50 percent interest in the outside-operated Scottish Area Gas Evacuation (“SAGE”) system. The SAGE pipeline transports natural gas from the Brae area and the third-party Beryl area and has a     5    Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements  total wet natural gas capacity of 1.1 billion cubic feet (“bcf”) per day. The SAGE terminal at St. Fergus in northeast Scotland processes natural gas from the SAGE pipeline and has the capacity for almost 1 bcf per day of third-party natural gas from the Britannia, Atlantic and Cromarty fields.  In the U.K. Atlantic Margin, we own a 30 percent working interest in the outside-operated Foinaven area complex, consisting of a 28 percent working interest in the main Foinaven field, 47 percent working interest in East Foinaven and 20 percent working interest in the T35 and T25 fields. Net sales from the Foinaven fields averaged 12 mbpd of liquid hydrocarbons and 6 mmcfd of natural gas in 2008.  Norway – Norway is a strategic and growing core area, which complements our long-standing operations in the U.K. sector of the North Sea discussed above. We were approved for our first operatorship on the Norwegian continental shelf in 2002, where today we operate seven licenses, including the PL 505, which was awarded in January 2009.  The operated Alvheim complex located on the Norwegian continental shelf commenced production in June 2008. The complex consists of a floating production, storage and offloading vessel (“FPSO”) with subsea infrastructure. Produced oil is transported by shuttle tanker and produced natural gas transported to the SAGE system using a new 14-inch diameter, 24-mile cross border pipeline. First production to the complex was from the Alvheim development which is comprised of the Kameleon and Kneler discoveries, in which we have a 65 percent working interest, and the Boa discovery, in which we have a 58 percent working interest. At the end of 2008, the Alvheim development included ten producing wells and two water disposal wells. The nearby Vilje discovery, in which we own a 47 percent outside-operated working interest, began producing through the Alvheim complex in August 2008. The two Vilje development wells were drilled and completed in 2007. Additionally, in 2007, the Norwegian government approved a plan for development and operation to develop the Volund field as a subsea tie-back to the Alvheim complex. The Volund development will consist of three production wells and one water disposal well, all to be drilled in the 2009 and 2010. The Volund development, in which we own a 65 percent working interest and serve as operator, is expected to begin production in late 2009.  In addition, we hold a 28 percent outside-operated interest in the Gudrun field, located 120 miles off the coast of Norway, where a successful appraisal well was drilled in 2006. In January 2009, the operator announced a development concept that includes a fixed processing platform with seven production wells that would be tied to existing facilities on the Sleipner field. A final investment decision is expected in 2009.  On October 31, 2008, we closed the sale of our non-core, outside-operated interests (24 percent of Heimdal field, 47 percent of Vale field and 20 percent of Skirne field) and associated undeveloped acreage in offshore Norway.  Ireland – In December 2008, we announced an agreement to sell our wholly-owned subsidiary which owns our producing properties in Ireland. Closing is subject to customary closing conditions. Properties included in the sale are our 100 percent working interest in the Kinsale Head, Ballycotton and Southwest Kinsale natural gas fields and our 87 percent operated working interest in the Seven Heads natural gas field in the Celtic Sea offshore Ireland. Also included is a 100 percent interest in our gas storage business which allows us to provide full third-party storage services from the Southwest Kinsale field.  We own a 19 percent working interest in the outside-operated Corrib natural gas development project, located 40 miles off Ireland’s northwest coast, where six of the seven wells necessary to develop the field have been drilled. Four of these wells were completed and tested at the end of 2008. Terminal construction and offshore pipe installation are currently underway and onshore pipeline installation is planned to commence in 2009. The operator expects first production from the field in late 2010 or early 2011.  Equatorial Guinea – We own a 63 percent operated working interest in the Alba field offshore Equatorial Guinea During 2008, net liquid hydrocarbon sales average 41 mbpd or 28 percent of our international liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes, and net natural gas sales averaged 366 mmcfd, or 64 percent of our international natural gas sales. Net liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes in 2008 included 26 mbpd of condensate.  We also own a 52 percent interest in Alba Plant LLC, an equity method investee that operates an onshore liquefied petroleum gas (“LPG”) processing plant. Alba field natural gas is supplied to the LPG plant under a long-term contract at a fixed price. During 2008, a gross 883 mmcfd of natural gas was supplied to the LPG production facility and our net liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes in 2008 included 11 mbpd of LPG and 4 mbpd of secondary condensate produced by Alba Plant LLC.    6    Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements As part of our Integrated Gas segment, we own 45 percent of Atlantic Methanol Production Company LLC (“AMPCO”) and 60 percent of Equatorial Guinea LNG Holdings Limited (“EGHoldings”). AMPCO operates a methanol plant and EGHoldings operates an LNG production facility, both located on Bioko Island. Alba field dry natural gas, which remains after the condensate and LPG are removed, is supplied to both of these facilities under long-term contracts at fixed prices. Because of the location of and limited local demand for natural gas in Equatorial Guinea, we consider the prices under the contracts with Alba Plant LLC, AMPCO and EGHoldings to be comparable to the price that could be realized from transactions with unrelated parties in this market under the same or similar circumstances. Our share of the income ultimately generated by the subsequent export of LPG produced by Alba Plant LLC is reflected in our E&P segment. Our share of the income ultimately generated by the subsequent export of methanol produced by AMPCO and LNG produced by EGHoldings is reflected in our Integrated Gas segment as discussed below. During 2008, a gross 94 mmcfd of dry natural gas was supplied to the methanol plant and a gross 565 mmcfd of dry gas was supplied to the LNG production facility. Any remaining dry gas is returned offshore and reinjected into the Alba reservoir for later production.  Angola – The discoveries on Blocks 31 and 32 represent four potential development hubs. The Plutao, Saturno, Venus and Marte discoveries and one successful appraisal well form a planned development area in the northeastern portion of Block 31. In 2008, we received approval to proceed with this first deepwater development project, called the PSVM development. Key contracts were awarded and construction work commenced in the second half of 2008. A total of 48 production and injection wells are planned for the PSVM development. Other discoveries on Block 31 comprise potential development areas in the southeast and middle portions of the block. Seven of the Block 32 discoveries form a potential development in the eastern area of that block.  Libya – We resumed operations in Libya in 2006, holding a 16 percent outside-operated interest in the Waha concessions. Net liquid hydrocarbon sales in Libya averaged 46 mbpd in 2008 compared to 45 mbpd in 2007. The 2008 net liquid hydrocarbon sales in Libya represented 31 percent of our international liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes. Net natural gas sales in Libya averaged 4 mmcfd in 2008.  Gabon – We are the operator of the Tchatamba South, Tchatamba West and Tchatamba Marin fields offshore Gabon with a 56 percent working interest. Net sales in Gabon averaged 6 mbpd of liquid hydrocarbons in 2008. Production from these three fields is processed on a single offshore facility at Tchatamba Marin, with the processed oil being transported through an offshore and onshore pipeline to an outside-operated storage facility.  Other Matters  During the first quarter of 2008, we relinquished our interest in an exploration and production license in Sudan, and as a result, we no longer have any interests in Sudan.  We ceased efforts to pursue exploration opportunities in Ukraine and closed our Kiev office in the third quarter of 2008.  The above discussion of the E&P segment includes forward-looking statements with respect to anticipated future exploratory and development drilling, Blocks 31 and 32 offshore Angola, the Equatorial Guinea discoveries, the timing of production from the Woodford Shale resource play, the Droshky and Ozona developments in the Gulf of Mexico, the Volund development, the sale of a subsidiary which owns producing properties in Ireland and the Corrib project. Some factors which could potentially affect these forward-looking statements include pricing, supply and demand for petroleum products, the amount of capital available for exploration and development, regulatory constraints, drilling rig availability, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, acts of war or terrorist acts and the governmental or military response, and other geological, operating and economic considerations. Except for the Volund development, the foregoing forward-looking statements may be further affected by the inability to obtain or delay in obtaining necessary government and third-party approvals and permits. The possible developments on Blocks 31 and 32 offshore Angola, and the Equatorial Guinea discoveries could further be affected by presently known data concerning size and character of reservoirs, economic recoverability, future drilling success and production experience. Factors that could affect the sale of the subsidiary include customary closing conditions.

Costs incurred for the periods ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 relating to the development of proved undeveloped liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves, were $1,189 million, $1,250 million and $1,010 million. Of the 289 million boe of proved undeveloped reserves at year-end 2008, 64 percent of the volume is associated with projects that have been included in proved reserves for more than three years while 19 percent of the proved undeveloped reserves were added during 2008. As of December 31, 2008, estimated future development costs relating to the development of proved undeveloped liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves for the years 2009 through 2011 are projected to be $1,244 million, $508 million and $262 million.  The above estimated quantities of net proved liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves and estimated future development costs relating to the development of proved undeveloped liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas     8    Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements  reserves are forward-looking statements and are based on a number of assumptions, including (among others) commodity prices, presently known physical data concerning size and character of the reservoirs, economic recoverability, technology developments, future drilling success, industry economic conditions, levels of cash flow from operations, production experience and other operating considerations. To the extent these assumptions prove inaccurate, actual recoveries and development costs could be different than current estimates.  For a discussion of the proved liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserve estimation process, see Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Critical Accounting Estimates – Estimated Net Recoverable Reserve Quantities – Proved Liquid Hydrocarbon and Natural Gas Reserves, and for additional details of the estimated quantities of proved reserves at the end of each of the last three years, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Supplementary Information on Oil and Gas Producing Activities – Estimated Quantities of Proved Oil and Natural Gas Reserves. We filed reports with the U.S. Department of Energy (“DOE”) for 2007 disclosing our total year-end estimated liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves. The year-end estimates reported to the DOE are the same estimates reported in the Supplementary Information on Oil and Gas Producing Activities.  Delivery Commitments  We sell liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas under a variety of contractual arrangements, some of which specify the delivery of a fixed and determinable quantity. Worldwide, we are contractually committed to deliver 126 bcf of natural gas in the future. These contracts have various expiration dates through the year 2018. Our proved reserves in Alaska, the United Kingdom and other locations, are sufficient to fulfill these delivery commitments.

The joint venture produces bitumen from oil sands deposits in the Athabasca region and upgrades the bitumen to synthetic crude oil. The AOSP’s asset is the mining and extraction operations of the Muskeg River mine located near Fort McMurray, Alberta, which began bitumen production in 2003, together with Scotford upgrading infrastructure located northeast of Edmonton, Alberta. The underlying developed leases are held for the duration of the project, with royalties paid to the province of Alberta. As of December 31, 2008, we have rights to participate in developed and undeveloped leases totaling approximately 215,000 gross (45,000 net) acres. Prior to December 6, 2009, we are entitled to participate in any new land acquisitions by either of the other AOSP owners within a defined area of mutual interest.  Current AOSP operations use established processes to mine oil sands deposits from an open-pit mine, extract the bitumen and upgrade it into synthetic crude oils. Bitumen production from the mine is taken by pipeline to the Scotford upgrader.  Ore is mined using traditional truck and shovel mining techniques. The mined ore passes through primary crushers to reduce the ore chunks in size and is then sent to rotary breakers where the chunks are further reduced to smaller particles. The particles are combined with hot water to create slurry. The slurry moves through a pipeline where it separates into sand, clay and bitumen. Air is introduced to the slurry mixture, which creates a bitumen-rich froth. A solvent is added to the bitumen froth to separate out the remaining solids, water and heavy asphaltenes. The solvent washes the sand and produces clean bitumen that is required for the upgrader to run efficiently. The process yields a mixture of solvent and bitumen, referred to as “dilbit”, which is then transported from the mine to the Scotford upgrader via the approximately 300 mile Corridor Pipeline. The bitumen is upgraded at Scotford using both hydro-treating and a hydro-conversion process to remove sulfur and break the heavy carbon molecules into lighter products. The three major products that the Scotford upgrader produces are Premium Albian synthetic crude oil, Albian Heavy synthetic crude oil and vacuum gas oil. The vacuum gas oil is sold to the operator under a long term contract at market-related prices, and the other products are sold in the marketplace.  The following table sets forth key operating statistics for the last two years.

The following table sets forth changes in estimated quantities of net proved bitumen reserves for the year 2008.

The above estimated quantity of net proved bitumen reserves is a forward-looking statement and is based on a number of assumptions, including (among others) commodity prices, volumes in-place, presently known physical data, recoverability of bitumen, industry economic conditions, levels of cash flow from operations, and other operating considerations. To the extent these assumptions prove inaccurate, actual recoveries could be different than current estimates. For a discussion of the proved bitumen reserves estimation process, see Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Critical Accounting Estimates – Estimated Net Recoverable Reserve Quantities – Proved Bitumen Reserves. Operations at the AOSP are not within the scope of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 25, “Suspension of Certain Accounting Requirements for Oil and Gas Producing Companies (an Amendment of Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Statement No. 19),” SFAS No. 69, “Disclosures about Oil and Gas Producing Activities (an Amendment of FASB Statements 19, 25, 33 and 39),” and Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) Rule 4-10 of Regulation S-X; therefore, bitumen production and reserves are not included in our Supplementary Information on Oil and Gas Producing Activities. The SEC has recently issued a release amending these disclosure requirements effective for annual reports on Form 10-K for fiscal years ending on or after December 31, 2009, see Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted for additional information.  Prior to our acquisition of Western, the first fully-integrated expansion of the existing AOSP facilities was approved in 2006. Expansion 1, which includes construction of mining and extraction facilities at the Jackpine mine, expansion of treatment facilities at the existing Muskeg River mine, expansion of the Scotford upgrader and development of related infrastructure, is anticipated to begin operations in late 2010 or 2011. When Expansion 1 is complete, we will have more than 50,000 bpd of net production and upgrading capacity in the Canadian oil sands. The timing and scope of future expansions and debottlenecking opportunities on existing operations remain under review.  During 2008, the Alberta government accepted the project’s application to have a portion of the Expansion 1 capital costs form part of the Muskeg River mine’s allowable cost recovery pool. Due to commodity price declines in the year, royalties for 2008 were one percent of the gross mine revenue.  Commencing January 1, 2009, the Alberta Royalty regime has been amended such that royalty rates will be based on the Canadian dollar (“CAD”) equivalent monthly average West Texas Intermediate (“WTI”) price. Royalty rates will rise from a minimum of one percent to a maximum of nine percent under the gross revenue method and from a minimum of 25 percent to a maximum of 40 percent under the net revenue method. Under both methods, the minimum royalty is based on a WTI price of $55.00 CAD per barrel and below while the maximum royalty is reached at a WTI price of $120.00 CAD per barrel and above, with a linear increase in royalty between the aforementioned prices.  The above discussion of the Oil Sands Mining segment includes forward-looking statements concerning the anticipated completion of AOSP Expansion 1. Factors which could affect the expansion project include transportation logistics, availability of materials and labor, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, delays in obtaining or conditions imposed by necessary government and third-party approvals and other risks customarily associated with construction projects.  Refining, Marketing and Transportation  Refining  We own and operate seven refineries in the Gulf Coast, Midwest and upper Great Plains regions of the United States with an aggregate refining capacity of 1.016 million barrels per day (“mmbpd”) of crude oil. During 2008,     12    Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements  our refineries processed 944 mbpd of crude oil and 207 mbpd of other charge and blend stocks. The table below sets forth the location and daily crude oil refining capacity of each of our refineries as of December 31, 2008.

The refineries process a wide variety of crude oils and produce numerous refined products, ranging from transportation fuels, such as reformulated gasolines, blend-grade gasolines intended for blending with fuel ethanol and ultra-low sulfur diesel fuel, to heavy fuel oil and asphalt. Additionally, we manufacture aromatics, cumene, propane, propylene, sulfur and maleic anhydride.  Our refineries are integrated with each other via pipelines, terminals and barges to maximize operating efficiency. The transportation links that connect our refineries allow the movement of intermediate products between refineries to optimize operations, produce higher margin products and utilize our processing capacity efficiently.  Our Garyville, Louisiana, refinery is located along the Mississippi River in southeastern Louisiana. The Garyville refinery processes heavy sour crude oil into products such as gasoline, distillates, sulfur, asphalt, propane, polymer grade propylene, isobutane and coke. In 2006, we approved an expansion of our Garyville refinery by 180 mbpd to 436 mbpd, with a currently projected cost of $3.35 billion (excluding capitalized interest). Construction commenced in early 2007 and is continuing on schedule. We estimate that, as of December 31, 2008, this project is approximately 75 percent complete. We expect to complete the expansion in late 2009.  Our Catlettsburg, Kentucky, refinery is located in northeastern Kentucky on the western bank of the Big Sandy River, near the confluence with the Ohio River. The Catlettsburg refinery processes sweet and sour crude oils into products such as gasoline, asphalt, diesel, jet fuel, petrochemicals, propane, propylene and sulfur.  Our Robinson, Illinois, refinery is located in the southeastern Illinois town of Robinson. The Robinson refinery processes sweet and sour crude oils into products such as multiple grades of gasoline, jet fuel, kerosene, diesel fuel, propane, propylene, sulfur and anode-grade coke.  Our Detroit, Michigan, refinery is located near Interstate 75 in southwest Detroit. The Detroit refinery processes light sweet and heavy sour crude oils, including Canadian crude oils, into products such as gasoline, diesel, asphalt, slurry, propane, chemical grade propylene and sulfur. In 2007, we approved a heavy oil upgrading and expansion project at our Detroit, Michigan, refinery, with a current projected cost of $2.2 billion (excluding capitalized interest). This project will enable the refinery to process additional heavy sour crude oils, including Canadian bitumen blends, and will increase its crude oil refining capacity by about 15 percent. Construction began in the first half of 2008 and is presently expected to be complete in mid-2012.  Our Canton, Ohio, refinery is located approximately 60 miles southeast of Cleveland, Ohio. The Canton refinery processes sweet and sour crude oils into products such as gasoline, diesel fuels, kerosene, propane, sulfur, asphalt, roofing flux, home heating oil and No. 6 industrial fuel oil.  Our Texas City, Texas, refinery is located on the Texas gulf coast approximately 30 miles south of Houston, Texas. The refinery processes sweet crude oil into products such as gasoline, propane, chemical grade propylene, slurry, sulfur and aromatics.  Our St. Paul Park, Minnesota, refinery is located in St. Paul Park, a suburb of Minneapolis-St. Paul. The St. Paul Park refinery processes predominantly Canadian crude oils into products such as gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, kerosene, asphalt, propane, propylene and sulfur.    13    Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The above discussion includes forward-looking statements concerning the expansion of the Garyville refinery and the Detroit refinery heavy oil upgrading and expansion project. Some factors that could affect those projects include transportation logistics, availability of materials and labor, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, delays in obtaining or conditions imposed by necessary government and third-party approvals and other risks customarily associated with construction projects.  Planned maintenance activities requiring temporary shutdown of certain refinery operating units, or turnarounds, are periodically performed at each refinery. We performed major turnaround activities at our Robinson, Catlettsburg, Garyville and Canton refineries in 2008, at our Catlettsburg, Robinson and St. Paul Park refineries in 2007 and at our Catlettsburg refinery in 2006.  The following table sets forth our refinery production by product group for each of the last three years.

Our crude oil supply contracts are generally term contracts with market related pricing provisions. The following table provides information on our sources of crude oil for each of the last three years. The crude oil sourced outside of North America was acquired from various foreign national oil companies, producing companies and trading companies. Of the U.S. and Canadian sourced crude processed at our refineries, 27 mbpd, or 5 percent, was supplied by a combination of our E&P and OSM production operations for the year 2008.

Refined product marketing and distribution – We are a supplier of refined products to resellers and consumers within our 23-state market area in the Midwest, upper Great Plains, Gulf Coast and southeastern regions of the United States. Our market area includes approximately 4,600 Marathon branded-retail outlets concentrated in the Midwest and southeastern states. We currently own and distribute from 65 light product and 22 asphalt terminals. In addition, we distribute through 68 third-party terminals in our market area. Our marine transportation operations include 15 towboats and 196 owned and 5 leased barges that transport refined products on the Ohio, Mississippi and Illinois rivers, their tributaries and the Intercoastal Waterway. We lease or own 2,500 railcars of various sizes and capacities for movement and storage of refined products and over 140 transport trucks.  The following table sets forth, as a percentage of total refined product sales, sales of refined products to our different customer types for the past three years.

On April 1, 2006, we changed our accounting for matching buy/sell arrangements as a result of a new accounting standard. This change resulted in lower refined products sales volumes for 2008, 2007 and the remainder of 2006 than would have been reported under our previous accounting practices. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.  Gasoline and distillates – We sell gasoline, gasoline blendstocks and No. 1 and No. 2 fuel oils (including kerosene, jet fuel, diesel fuel and home heating oil) to wholesale marketing customers in the Midwest, upper Great Plains, Gulf Coast and southeastern regions of the United States. We sold 47 percent of our gasoline volumes and 88 percent of our distillates volumes on a wholesale or spot market basis in 2008. The demand for gasoline is seasonal in many of our markets, with demand typically being at its highest levels during the summer months.  We have blended fuel ethanol into gasoline for over 15 years and began increasing our blending program in 2007, in part due to federal regulations that require us to use specified volumes of renewable fuels. We blended 57 mbpd of ethanol into gasoline in 2008, 41 mbpd in 2007 and 35 mbpd in 2006. The future expansion or contraction of our ethanol blending program will be driven by the economics of the ethanol supply and by government regulations. We sell reformulated gasoline, which is also blended with ethanol, in parts of our marketing territory, including: Chicago, Illinois; Louisville, Kentucky; northern Kentucky; Milwaukee, Wisconsin and Hartford, Illinois. We also sell biodiesel-blended diesel in Minnesota, Illinois and Kentucky.  In 2007, we acquired a 35 percent interest in an entity which owns and operates a 110-million-gallon-per-year ethanol production facility in Clymers, Indiana. We also own a 50 percent interest in an entity which owns a 110-million-gallon-per-year ethanol production facility in Greenville, Ohio. The Greenville plant began production in February 2008. Both of these facilities are managed by a co-owner.  Propane – We produce propane at all seven of our refineries. Propane is primarily used for home heating and cooking, as a feedstock within the petrochemical industry, for grain drying and as a fuel for trucks and other vehicles. Our propane sales are typically split evenly between the home heating market and industrial consumers.  Feedstocks and special products – We are a producer and marketer of petrochemicals and specialty products. Product availability varies by refinery and includes benzene, cumene, dilute naphthalene oil, molten maleic anhydride, molten sulfur, propylene, toluene and xylene. We market propylene, cumene and sulfur domestically to customers in the chemical industry. We sell maleic anhydride throughout the United States and Canada. We also have the capacity to produce 1,400 tons per day of anode grade coke at our Robinson refinery, which is used to make carbon anodes for the aluminum smelting industry, and 2,700 tons per day of fuel grade coke at the Garyville refinery, which is used for power generation and in miscellaneous industrial applications. In September 2008, we shut down our lubes facility in Catlettsburg, Kentucky, and sold from inventory through December 31, 2008; therefore, base oils, aromatic extracts and slack wax are no longer being produced and marketed. In addition, we have recently discontinued production and sales of petroleum pitch and aliphatic solvents.  Heavy fuel oil – We produce and market heavy oil, also known as fuel oil, residual fuel or slurry at all seven of our refineries. Another product of crude oil, heavy oil is primarily used in the utility and ship bunkering (fuel) industries, though there are other more specialized uses of the product. We also sell heavy fuel oil at our terminals in Wellsville, Ohio, and Chattanooga, Tennessee.  Asphalt – We have refinery based asphalt production capacity of up to 102 mbpd. We market asphalt through 33 owned or leased terminals throughout the Midwest and Southeast. We have a broad customer base, including     15    Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements  approximately 710 asphalt-paving contractors, government entities (states, counties, cities and townships) and asphalt roofing shingle manufacturers. We also produce asphalt cements, polymerized asphalt, asphalt emulsions and industrial asphalts.  Retail Marketing  SSA, our wholly-owned subsidiary, sells gasoline and merchandise through owned and operated retail outlets primarily under the Speedway® and SuperAmerica® brands. Diesel fuel is also sold at a number of these outlets. SSA retail outlets offer a wide variety of merchandise, such as prepared foods, beverages, and non-food items, as well as a significant number of proprietary items. As of December 31, 2008, SSA had 1,617 retail outlets in nine states. Sales of refined products through these retail outlets accounted for 15 percent of our refined product sales volumes in 2008. Revenues from sales of non-petroleum merchandise through these retail outlets totaled $2,838 million in 2008, $2,796 million in 2007 and $2,706 million in 2006. The demand for gasoline is seasonal in a majority of SSA markets, usually with the highest demand during the summer driving season. Profit levels from the sale of merchandise and services tend to be less volatile than profit levels from the retail sale of gasoline and diesel fuel.  In October 2008, we sold our interest in Pilot Travel Centers LLC (“PTC”), an operator of travel centers in the United States.  Pipeline Transportation  We own a system of pipelines through Marathon Pipe Line LLC (“MPL”) and Ohio River Pipe Line LLC (“ORPL”), our wholly-owned subsidiaries. Our pipeline systems transport crude oil and refined products primarily in the Midwest and Gulf Coast regions to our refineries, our terminals and other pipeline systems. Our MPL and ORPL wholly-owned and undivided interest common carrier systems consist of 1,815 miles of crude oil lines and 1,826 miles of refined product lines comprising 34 systems located in 11 states. The MPL common carrier pipeline network is one of the largest petroleum pipeline systems in the United States, based on total barrels delivered. Our common carrier pipeline systems are subject to state and Federal Energy Regulatory Commission regulations and guidelines, including published tariffs for the transportation of crude oil and refined products. Third parties generated 11 percent of the crude oil and refined product shipments on our MPL and ORPL common carrier pipelines in 2008. Our MPL and ORPL common carrier pipelines transported the volumes shown in the following table for each of the last three years.  Pipeline Barrels Handled                 (Thousands of barrels per day)   2008   2007   2006   Crude oil trunk lines   1,405   1,451   1,437   Refined products trunk lines   960   1,049   1,101                 TOTAL   2,365   2,500   2,538  We also own 176 miles of private crude oil pipelines and 850 miles of private refined products pipelines, and we lease 217 miles of common carrier refined product pipelines. We have partial ownership interests in several pipeline companies that have approximately 780 miles of crude oil pipelines and 3,000 miles of refined products pipelines, including about 800 miles operated by MPL. In addition, MPL operates most of our private pipelines and 985 miles of crude oil and 160 miles of natural gas pipelines owned by our E&P segment.  Our major refined product lines include the Cardinal Products Pipeline and the Wabash Pipeline. The Cardinal Products Pipeline delivers refined products from Kenova, West Virginia, to Columbus, Ohio. The Wabash Pipeline system delivers product from Robinson, Illinois, to various terminals in the area of Chicago, Illinois. Other significant refined product pipelines owned and operated by MPL extend from: Robinson, Illinois, to Louisville, Kentucky; Garyville, Louisiana, to Zachary, Louisiana; and Texas City, Texas, to Pasadena, Texas.    16    Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements In addition, as of December 31, 2008, we had interests in the following refined product pipelines:        •    65 percent undivided ownership interest in the Louisville-Lexington system, a petroleum products pipeline system extending from Louisville to Lexington, Kentucky;        •    60 percent interest in Muskegon Pipeline LLC, which owns a refined products pipeline extending from Griffith, Indiana, to North Muskegon, Michigan;        •    50 percent interest in Centennial Pipeline LLC, which owns a refined products system connecting the Gulf Coast region with the Midwest market;        •    17 percent interest in Explorer Pipeline Company, a refined products pipeline system extending from the Gulf Coast to the Midwest; and        •    6 percent interest in Wolverine Pipe Line Company, a refined products pipeline system extending from Chicago, Illinois, to Toledo, Ohio.  Our major crude oil lines run from: Patoka, Illinois, to Catlettsburg, Kentucky; Patoka, Illinois, to Robinson, Illinois; Patoka, Illinois, to Lima, Ohio; Samaria, Michigan, to Detroit, Michigan; and St. James, Louisiana, to Garyville, Louisiana.  In addition, as of December 31, 2008, we had interests in the following crude oil pipelines:        •    51 percent interest in LOOP LLC, the owner and operator of LOOP, which is the only U.S. deepwater oil port, located 18 miles off the coast of Louisiana, and a crude oil pipeline connecting the port facility to storage caverns and tanks at Clovelly, Louisiana;        •    59 percent interest in LOCAP LLC, which owns a crude oil pipeline connecting LOOP and the Capline system;        •    37 percent interest in the Capline system, a large-diameter crude oil pipeline extending from St. James, Louisiana, to Patoka, Illinois;        •    26 percent undivided ownership interest in the Maumee Pipeline System, a large diameter crude oil pipeline extending from Lima, Ohio, to Samaria, Michigan; and        •    17 percent interest in Minnesota Pipe Line Company, LLC, which owns crude oil pipelines extending from Clearbrook, Minnesota, to Cottage Grove, Minnesota, which is in the vicinity of our St. Paul Park, Minnesota refinery.  We plan to construct, by the year 2012, a new section of pipeline connecting with the existing crude line from Samaria, Michigan, to Detroit, Michigan. This new section will deliver additional supplies of Canadian crude to our Detroit refinery. The above discussion includes forward-looking statements concerning the construction of a new section of pipeline in Michigan. Some factors that could affect this project include transportation logistics, availability of materials and labor, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, delays in obtaining or conditions imposed by government or third-party approvals and other risks customarily associated with construction projects.  Integrated Gas   Our integrated gas operations include natural gas liquefaction and regasification operations and methanol production operations. Also included in the financial results of the Integrated Gas segment are the costs associated with ongoing development of projects to link stranded natural gas resources with key demand areas.  LNG Operations  We hold a 60 percent interest in EGHoldings, which is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. In May 2007, EGHoldings completed construction of a 3.7 million metric tonnes per annum (“mmtpa”) LNG production facility on Bioko Island and delivered its first cargo of LNG. LNG from the production facility is sold     17    Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements  under a 3.4 mmtpa, or 460 mmcfd, sales and purchase agreement with a 17-year term. The purchaser under the agreement takes delivery of the LNG on Bioko Island, with pricing linked principally to the Henry Hub index, regardless of destination. This production facility allows us to monetize our natural gas reserves from the Alba field, as natural gas for the facility is purchased from the Alba field participants under a long-term natural gas supply agreement. Sales of LNG from this production facility totaled 3.4 metric tonnes in 2008. In 2008 we continued discussions with the government of Equatorial Guinea and partners regarding a potential second LNG production facility on Bioko Island.  We also own a 30 percent interest in a Kenai, Alaska, natural gas liquefaction plant, and lease two 87,500 cubic meter tankers used to transport LNG to customers in Japan. Feedstock for the plant is supplied from a portion of our natural gas production in the Cook Inlet. From the first production in 1969, we have sold our share of the LNG plant’s production under long-term contract with two of Japan’s largest utility companies, with 2008 LNG deliveries totaling 40 gross bcf. In June 2008 we, along with our partner, received approval from the DOE to extend the export license for this natural gas liquefaction plant through March 2011.  In April 2004, we began delivering LNG cargoes at the Elba Island, Georgia, LNG regasification terminal pursuant to an LNG sales and purchase agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, we have the right to deliver and sell up to 58 bcf of natural gas (as LNG) per year, through March 31, 2021, with a possible extension to November 30, 2023. In September 2004, we signed an agreement under which we will be supplied with 58 bcf of natural gas per year, as LNG, for a minimum period of five years. The agreement allows for delivery of LNG at the Elba Island LNG regasification terminal with pricing linked to the Henry Hub index. This supply agreement enables us to fully utilize our rights at Elba Island during the period of this agreement, while affording us the flexibility to commercialize other stranded natural gas resources beyond the term of this contract. The agreement commenced in 2005.  Methanol Operations  We own a 45 percent interest in AMPCO, which is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. AMPCO owns a methanol plant located in Malabo, Equatorial Guinea. Feedstock for the plant is supplied from our natural gas production from the Alba field. Sales of methanol from the plant totaled 792,794 metric tonnes in 2008. Production from the plant is used to supply customers in Europe and the United States.  Natural Gas Technology  We are developing a range of natural gas conversion technologies that can connect stranded natural gas to both conventional and transportation fuel markets. Our proprietary Gas-to-Fuels (“GTF™”) process offers the ability to convert natural gas into premium fuels while bypassing conventional intermediate synthetic gasification technology. The base patent for this technology was awarded in 2007.  During 2008, we entered into agreements with GRT, Inc., a Delaware corporation, to cooperate on the advancement of gas-to-fuels-related technology. This transaction provides us with access to additional specialized technical and research personnel and lab facilities, and significantly expanded the portfolio of patents available to us via license and through a cooperative development program. In addition, we have acquired a 20 percent interest in GRT, Inc.  Also, during 2008, we completed construction of a facility to demonstrate operation of the fully integrated GTF™ process at a practical scale. We are evaluating the commercialization of this technology and have engaged an engineering contractor to provide engineering and design services for using the GTF™ technology on a commercial scale.  In addition to GTF™, we continue to evaluate the application of other natural gas technologies, including LNG technology enhancements, gas hydrates and gas-to-liquids technology.  The above discussion of the Integrated Gas segment contains forward-looking statements with respect to the possible expansion of the LNG production facility and expectations for a GTF™ demonstration facility. Factors that could potentially affect the possible expansion of the LNG production facility include partner and government approvals, access to sufficient natural gas volumes through exploration or commercial negotiations with other resource owners and access to sufficient regasification capacity. Factors that could potentially affect the GTF™ demonstration facility include construction delays, start-up difficulties relating to scale-up in the process and unforeseen difficulties in our testing program related to moving from laboratory to practical scale. The foregoing factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.    18    Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Competition and Market Conditions  Strong competition exists in all sectors of the oil and gas industry and, in particular, in the exploration for and development of new reserves. We compete with major integrated and independent oil and gas companies, as well as national oil companies, for the acquisition of oil and natural gas leases and other properties. We compete with these companies for the equipment and labor required to develop and operate those properties and in the marketing of oil and natural gas to end-users. Many of our competitors have financial and other resources greater than those available to us. Acquiring the more attractive exploration opportunities frequently requires competitive bids involving front-end bonus payments or commitments-to-work programs. We also compete in attracting and retaining personnel, including geologists, geophysicists and other specialists. Based upon statistics compiled in the “2008 Global Upstream Performance Review” published by IHS Herold Inc., we rank ninth among U.S.-based petroleum companies on the basis of 2007 worldwide liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas production.  We also compete with other producers of synthetic and conventional crude oil for the sale of our synthetic crude oil to refineries in North America. There are several additional synthetic crude oil projects being contemplated by various competitors and, if undertaken and completed, these projects may result in a significant increase in the supply of synthetic crude oil to the market. Since not all refineries are able to process or refine synthetic crude oil in significant volumes, there can be no assurance that sufficient market demand will exist at all times to absorb our share of the synthetic crude oil production from the AOSP at economically viable prices.  We must also compete with a large number of other companies to acquire crude oil for refinery processing and in the distribution and marketing of a full array of petroleum products. Based upon the “The Oil & Gas Journal 2009 Worldwide Refinery Survey”, we rank fifth among U.S. petroleum companies on the basis of U.S. crude oil refining capacity as of December 31, 2008. We compete in four distinct markets for the sale of refined products – wholesale, spot, branded and retail distribution. We believe we compete with about 45 companies in the sale of refined products to wholesale marketing customers, including private-brand marketers and large commercial and industrial consumers; about 70 companies in the sale of refined products in the spot market; ten refiners or marketers in the supply of refined products to refiner branded jobbers and dealers; and approximately 280 retailers in the retail sale of refined products. (A jobber is a business who does not carry out refining operations, but who supplies refiner-branded products to gasoline stations or convenience stores. Dealers refer to a retail service station or convenience store operator, affiliated with a brand identity.) We compete in the convenience store industry through SSA’s retail outlets. The retail outlets offer consumers gasoline, diesel fuel (at selected locations) and a broad mix of other merchandise and services. In recent years, several nontraditional fuel retailers, such as supermarkets, club stores and mass merchants, have affected the convenience store industry with their entrance into the retail transportation fuel business.  Our operating results are affected by price changes in conventional and synthetic crude oil, natural gas and petroleum products, as well as changes in competitive conditions in the markets we serve. Generally, results from production and oil sands mining operations benefit from higher crude oil prices while the refining and wholesale marketing gross margin may be adversely affected by crude oil price increases. Price differentials between sweet and sour crude oil also affect operating results. Market conditions in the oil and gas industry are cyclical and subject to global economic and political events and new and changing governmental regulations.  Environmental Matters  The Public Policy Committee of our Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing our position on public issues, including environmental matters. Our Corporate Health, Environment and Safety organization has the responsibility to ensure that our operating organizations maintain environmental compliance systems that are in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. Committees comprised of certain of our officers review our overall performance associated with various environmental compliance programs. We also have a Crisis Management Team, composed primarily of senior management, which oversees the response to any major emergency, environmental or other incident involving us or any of our properties.  Legislation and regulations pertaining to climate change and greenhouse gas emissions have the potential to impact us. The Kyoto Protocol, effective in 2005, has been ratified by countries in which we have or in the future may have operations. Canadian federal and provincial laws, the U.S. Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, the European Union requirements and California laws contain provisions related to greenhouse gas emissions. Other climate change legislation and regulations in the United States, Canada and abroad are in various stages of development or implementation. These regulations are further along in development in Alberta, Canada, and in the European Union, where we have significant operations. Our industry and businesses     19    Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements  throughout the United States are also awaiting the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (“EPA”) actions upon the remand of the U.S. Supreme Court decision in Massachusetts v. USEPA, which could have impacts on a number of air permitting and environmental regulatory programs. In July 2008, the EPA issued an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (“ANPR”) to address the Supreme Court decision and to seek public input on potential actions it may take to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. Action by EPA on the ANPR is expected in 2009. There also is other pending litigation which could affect whether EPA regulates greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, a new Administration in the U.S. may choose to address greenhouse gas emissions through regulation, permitting or other action in 2009. Our liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas and bitumen production and processing operations typically result in emissions of greenhouse gases. Likewise, emissions arise from our RM&T operations, including the refining of crude oil and the transportation of crude oil and refined products. Although there may be adverse financial impact (including compliance costs, potential permitting delays and potential reduced demand for crude oil or certain refined products) associated with any legislation, regulation, EPA or other action, the extent and magnitude of that impact cannot be reliably or accurately estimated due to the fact that requirements have only recently been adopted and the present uncertainty regarding the additional measures and how they will be implemented. Private party litigation has also been brought against emitters of greenhouse gas emissions, but we have not been named in those cases. As part of our commitment to environmental stewardship, we estimate and publicly report greenhouse gas emissions from our operations. We are working to continuously improve the accuracy and completeness of these estimates. In addition, we continuously strive to improve operational and energy efficiencies through resource and energy conservation where practicable and cost effective.  Our businesses are also subject to numerous other laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. These environmental laws and regulations include the Clean Air Act (“CAA”) with respect to air emissions, the Clean Water Act (“CWA”) with respect to water discharges, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) with respect to solid and hazardous waste treatment, storage and disposal, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”) with respect to releases and remediation of hazardous substances and the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (“OPA-90”) with respect to oil pollution and response. In addition, many states where we operate have their own similar laws dealing with similar matters. New laws are being enacted, and regulations are being adopted by various regulatory agencies on a continuing basis and the costs of compliance with these new rules can only be broadly appraised until their implementation becomes more accurately defined. In some cases, they can impose liability for the entire cost of clean-up on any responsible party without regard to negligence or fault and impose liability on us for the conduct of others or conditions others have caused, or for our acts that complied with all applicable requirements when we performed them. The ultimate impact of complying with existing laws and regulations is not clearly known or determinable because certain implementing regulations for some environmental laws have not yet been finalized or, in some instances, are undergoing revision. These environmental laws and regulations, particularly the 1990 Amendments to the CAA and its implementing regulations, new water quality requirements and stricter fuel regulations, could result in increased capital, operating and compliance costs.  For a discussion of environmental capital expenditures and costs of compliance for air, water, solid waste and remediation, see Item 3. Legal Proceedings and Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Environmental Matters, Litigation and Contingencies.  Air  Of particular significance to our refining operations are EPA regulations that require reduced sulfur levels in diesel fuel for off-road use. We have spent approximately $120 million between 2006 and 2008, and plan to spend approximately $50 million in 2009 on refinery investments to produce ultra-low sulfur diesel fuel for off-road use, in compliance with EPA regulations. Further, we have estimated that we may spend approximately $1 billion over a five-year period beginning in 2008 to comply with Mobile Source Air Toxics II (“MSAT II”) regulations relating to benzene content in refined products. We have not finalized our strategy or cost estimates to comply with these requirements. Our actual MSAT II expenditures have totaled $76 million through December 31, 2008 and we expect to spend $200 million in 2009. The cost estimates are forward-looking statements and are subject to change as further work is completed in 2009.  The EPA is in the process of implementing regulations to address current National Ambient Air Quality Standards (“NAAQS”) for fine particulate emissions and ozone. In connection with these standards, the EPA will designate certain areas as “nonattainment,” meaning that the air quality in such areas does not meet the NAAQS. To address these nonattainment areas, the EPA proposed a rule in 2004 called the Interstate Air Quality Rule (“IAQR”) that would require significant emissions reductions in numerous states. The final rule, promulgated in 2005, was renamed the Clean Air Interstate Rule (“CAIR”). While the EPA expects that states will meet their     20    Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements  CAIR obligations by requiring emissions reductions from electric generating units, states were to have the final say on what sources they regulate to meet attainment criteria. Significant uncertainty in the final requirements of this rule resulted from litigation (State of North Carolina, et al. v. EPA). In July 2008, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit vacated the CAIR in its entirety and remanded it to EPA to promulgate a rule consistent with the Court’s opinion. In December 2008, the Court modified its July ruling to leave the CAIR in effect until EPA develops a new rule and control program. It is expected that the CAIR will be significantly altered, and it could result in changes in emissions control strategies. Our refinery operations are located in affected states, and some of these states may choose to propose more stringent fuels requirements to meet the CAIR. In addition, the EPA promulgated a revised ozone standard in March 2008, and the EPA has commenced the multi-year process to develop the implementing rules required by the Clean Air Act. We cannot reasonably estimate the final financial impact of the state actions to implement the CAIR until the EPA has issued a revised rule and states have taken further action to implement that rule. We also cannot reasonably estimate the final financial impact of the revised ozone standard until the implementing rules are established and judicial challenges over the revised ozone standard are resolved.  Water  We maintain numerous discharge permits as required under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System program of the CWA and have implemented systems to oversee our compliance efforts. In addition, we are regulated under OPA-90, which amended the CWA. Among other requirements, OPA-90 requires the owner or operator of a tank vessel or a facility to maintain an emergency plan to respond to releases of oil or hazardous substances. Also, in case of any such release, OPA-90 requires the responsible company to pay resulting removal costs and damages. OPA-90 also provides for civil penalties and imposes criminal sanctions for violations of its provisions.  Additionally, OPA-90 requires that new tank vessels entering or operating in U.S. waters be double-hulled and that existing tank vessels that are not double-hulled be retrofitted or removed from U.S. service, according to a phase-out schedule. All of the barges used for river transport of our raw materials and refined products meet the double-hulled requirements of OPA-90. We operate facilities at which spills of oil and hazardous substances could occur. Some coastal states in which we operate have passed state laws similar to OPA-90, but with expanded liability provisions, including provisions for cargo owner responsibility as well as ship owner and operator responsibility. We have implemented emergency oil response plans for all of our components and facilities covered by OPA-90, and we have established Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasures (“SPCC”) plans for facilities subject to CWA SPCC requirements.  Solid Waste  We continue to seek methods to minimize the generation of hazardous wastes in our operations. The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) establishes standards for the management of solid and hazardous wastes. Besides affecting waste disposal practices, RCRA also addresses the environmental effects of certain past waste disposal operations, the recycling of wastes and the regulation of underground storage tanks (“USTs”) containing regulated substances. We have ongoing RCRA treatment and disposal operations at one of our RM&T facilities and primarily utilize offsite third-party treatment and disposal facilities. In 2011, Canada will implement a ban on the land application of certain wastes, and we are developing options to treat or dispose of these wastes consistent with these new restrictions. Ongoing waste handling and disposal-related costs, however, are not expected to be material.  Remediation  We own or operate certain retail outlets where, during the normal course of operations, releases of refined products from USTs have occurred. Federal and state laws require that contamination caused by such releases at these sites be assessed and remediated to meet applicable standards. The enforcement of the UST regulations under RCRA has been delegated to the states, which administer their own UST programs. Our obligation to remediate such contamination varies, depending on the extent of the releases and the stringency of the laws and regulations of the states in which we operate. A portion of these remediation costs may be recoverable from the appropriate state UST reimbursement funds once the applicable deductibles have been satisfied. We also have other facilities which are subject to remediation under federal or state law. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings – Environmental Proceedings – Other Proceedings for a discussion of these sites.  The AOSP operations use established processes to mine deposits of bitumen from an open-pit mine, extract the bitumen and upgrade it into synthetic crude oils. Tailings are waste products created from the oil sands extraction     21    Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements  process which are placed in ponds. The AOSP is required to reclaim its tailing ponds as part of its on going reclamation work. The reclamation process uses developing technology and there is an inherent risk that the current process may not be as effective or perform as required in order to meet the approved closure and reclamation plan. The AOSP continues to develop its current reclamation technology and continues to investigate other alternate tailings management technologies. In February 2009, the Alberta Energy Resources Conservation Board issued a directive which more clearly defines criteria for managing oil sands tailings. The AOSP Joint Venture Parties are reviewing this directive to determine the impact on the oil sands operations and the timeline for the required compliance. Increased compliance costs may result if tailing pond reclamation technologies prove unsuccessful or the directive requires additional measures.  Other Matters  In 2007, the U.S. Congress passed the Energy Independence and Security Act (“EISA”), which, among other things, sets a target of 35 miles per gallon for the combined fleet of cars and light trucks in the United States by model year 2020, and contains a multiple-part Renewable Fuel Standard (“RFS”). The RFS was 9.0 billion gallons of renewable fuel in 2008, and is 11.1 billion gallons in 2009, increasing to 36.0 billion gallons by 2022. In the near term, the RFS will be satisfied primarily with fuel ethanol blended into gasoline. The RFS presents production and logistic challenges for both the fuel ethanol and petroleum refining industries. The RFS has required, and may in the future continue to require, additional capital expenditures or expenses by us to accommodate increased fuel ethanol use. Within the overall 36.0 billion gallon RFS, EISA establishes an advanced biofuel RFS that begins with 0.6 billion gallons in 2009 and increases to 21.0 billion gallons by 2022. Subsets within the advanced biofuel RFS include 0.5 billion gallons of biomass-based diesel in 2009, increasing to 1.0 billion gallons in 2012, and 0.1 billion gallons of cellulosic biofuel in 2010, increasing to 16.0 gallons by 2022. The advanced biofuels programs will present specific challenges in that we may have to enter into arrangements with other parties to meet our obligations to use advanced biofuels, including biomass-based diesel and cellulosic biofuel, with potentially uncertain supplies of these new fuels. There will be compliance costs and uncertainties regarding how we will comply with the various requirements contained in this law and related regulations. We may experience a decrease in demand for refined petroleum products due to an increase in combined fleet mileage or due to refined petroleum products being replaced by renewable fuels.  The USX Separation  On December 31, 2001, pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization dated as of July 31, 2001, Marathon completed the USX Separation, in which:        •    its wholly-owned subsidiary United States Steel LLC converted into a Delaware corporation named United States Steel Corporation and became a separate, publicly traded company; and        •    USX Corporation changed its name to Marathon Oil Corporation.  As a result of the USX Separation, Marathon and United States Steel are separate companies and neither has any ownership interest in the other.  In connection with the USX Separation and pursuant to the Plan of Reorganization, Marathon and United States Steel have entered into a series of agreements governing their relationship after the USX Separation and providing for the allocation of tax and certain other liabilities and obligations arising from periods before the USX Separation. The following is a description of the material terms of one of those agreements.    22    Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Financial Matters Agreement  Under the financial matters agreement, United States Steel has assumed and agreed to discharge all of our principal repayment, interest payment and other obligations under the following, including any amounts due on any default or acceleration of any of those obligations, other than any default caused by us:        •    obligations under industrial revenue bonds related to environmental projects for current and former U.S. Steel Group facilities, with maturities ranging from 2011 through 2033;        •    sale-leaseback financing obligations under a lease for equipment at United States Steel’s Fairfield Works facility, with a lease term to 2012, subject to extensions;        •    obligations relating to various lease arrangements accounted for as operating leases and various guarantee arrangements, all of which were assumed by United States Steel; and        •    certain other guarantees.  The financial matters agreement also provides that, on or before the tenth anniversary of the USX Separation, United States Steel will provide for our discharge from any remaining liability under any of the assumed industrial revenue bonds. United States Steel may accomplish that discharge by refinancing or, to the extent not refinanced, paying us an amount equal to the remaining principal amount of all accrued and unpaid debt service outstanding on, and any premium required to immediately retire, the then outstanding industrial revenue bonds.  Under the financial matters agreement, United States Steel has all of the existing contractual rights under the leases assumed from us, including all rights related to purchase options, prepayments or the grant or release of security interests. However, United States Steel has no right to increase amounts due under or lengthen the term of any of the assumed lease obligations without our prior consent other than extensions set forth in the terms of the assumed leases.  The financial matters agreement requires us to use commercially reasonable efforts to assure compliance with all covenants and other obligations to avoid the occurrence of a default or the acceleration of the payments on the assumed obligations. The agreement also obligates us to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and maintain letters of credit and other liquidity arrangements required under the assumed obligations.  United States Steel’s obligations to us under the financial matters agreement are general unsecured obligations that rank equal to United States Steel’s accounts payable and other general unsecured obligations. The financial matters agreement does not contain any financial covenants and United States Steel is free to incur additional debt, grant mortgages on or security interests in its property and sell or transfer assets without our consent.  Concentrations of Credit Risk  We are exposed to credit risk in the event of nonpayment by counterparties, a significant portion of which are concentrated in energy-related industries. The creditworthiness of customers and other counterparties is subject to continuing review, including the use of master netting agreements, where appropriate. While no single customer accounts for more than 10 percent of annual revenues, we have significant exposures to United States Steel arising from the transaction discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements.  Trademarks, Patents and Licenses  We currently hold a number of U.S. and foreign patents and have various pending patent applications. Although in the aggregate our trademarks, patents and licenses are important to us, we do not regard any single trademark, patent, license or group of related trademarks, patents or licenses as critical or essential to our business as a whole.  Employees  We had 30,360 active employees as of December 31, 2008. Of that number, 19,794 were employees of SSA, most of who were employed at our retail marketing outlets.  Certain hourly employees at our Catlettsburg and Canton refineries are represented by the United Steel, Paper and Forestry, Rubber, Manufacturing, Energy, Allied Industrial and Service Workers Union under labor agreements that expire on January 31, 2012. Negotiations are currently underway with the same union in Texas     23    Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements  City with a contract expiration of March 31, 2009. The International Brotherhood of Teamsters represents certain hourly employees under labor agreements that are scheduled to expire on May 31, 2012 at our St. Paul Park refinery and January 31, 2011, at our Detroit refinery.  Executive Officers of the Registrant  The executive officers of Marathon and their ages as of February 1, 2009, are as follows:             Clarence P.

Risk Factors  We are subject to various risks and uncertainties in the course of our business. The following summarizes significant risks and uncertainties that may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.  A substantial or extended decline in liquid hydrocarbon or natural gas prices, or in refining and wholesale marketing gross margins, would reduce our operating results and cash flows and could adversely impact our future rate of growth and the carrying value of our assets.  Prices for liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas and refining and wholesale marketing gross margins fluctuate widely. Our revenues, operating results and future rate of growth are highly dependent on the prices we receive for our liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas and the margins we realize on our refined products. Historically, the markets for liquid hydrocarbons, natural gas and refined products have been volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future. Many of the factors influencing prices of liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas and refining and wholesale marketing gross margins are beyond our control. These factors include:        •    worldwide and domestic supplies of and demand for liquid hydrocarbons, natural gas and refined products;        •    the cost of exploring for, developing and producing liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas;        •    the cost of crude oil to be manufactured into refined products;        •    utilization rates of refineries;        •    natural gas and electricity supply costs incurred by refineries        •    the ability of the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to agree to and maintain production controls;        •    political instability or armed conflict in oil and natural gas producing regions;        •    changes in weather patterns and climate;        •    natural disasters such as hurricanes and tornados;        •    the price and availability of alternative and competing forms of energy;        •    domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes; and        •    general economic conditions worldwide.  The long-term effects of these and other factors on the prices of liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas, as well as on refining and wholesale marketing gross margins, are uncertain.  Lower liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas prices, may cause us to reduce the amount of these commodities that we produce, which may reduce our revenues, operating income and cash flows. Significant reductions in liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas prices or refining and wholesale marketing gross margins could require us to reduce our capital expenditures or impair the carrying value of our assets.  Estimates of liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas and bitumen reserves depend on many factors and assumptions, including various assumptions that are based on conditions in existence as of the dates of the estimates. Any material changes in those conditions or other factors affecting those assumptions could impair the quantity and value of our liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas and bitumen reserves.   The proved liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves information included in this report has been derived from engineering estimates. Those estimates were prepared by our in-house teams of reservoir engineers and geoscience professionals and reviewed, on a selected basis, by our Corporate Reserves Group or third-party consultants we have retained. The estimates were calculated using liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas prices in effect as of December 31, 2008, as well as other conditions in existence as of that date. Any significant future price     25    Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements  changes will have a material effect on the quantity and present value of our proved liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves. Future reserve revisions could also result from changes in, among other things, governmental regulation and severance and other production taxes.  Proved liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserve estimation is a subjective process that involves estimating volumes to be recovered from underground accumulations of liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas that cannot be directly measured. Estimates of economically recoverable liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves and of future net cash flows depend upon a number of variable factors and assumptions, including:        •    location, size and shape of the accumulation as well as fluid, rock and producing characteristics of the accumulation;        •    historical production from the area, compared with production from other comparable producing areas;        •    the assumed effects of regulation by governmental agencies; and        •    assumptions concerning future operating costs, severance and excise taxes, development costs and workover and repair costs.  As a result, different petroleum engineers, each using industry-accepted geologic and engineering practices and scientific methods, may produce different estimates of proved liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves and future net cash flows based on the same available data. Because of the subjective nature of liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserve estimates, each of the following items may differ materially from the amounts or other factors estimated:        •    the amount and timing of liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas production;        •    the revenues and costs associated with that production; and        •    the amount and timing of future development expenditures.  The discounted future net revenues from our proved liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves reflected in this report should not be considered as the market value of the reserves attributable to our liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas properties. As required by SEC Rule 4-10 of Regulation S-X, the estimated discounted future net revenues from our proved liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves are based on prices and costs as of the date of the estimate, while actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower.  In addition, the 10 percent discount factor required by the applicable rules of the SEC to be used to calculate discounted future net revenues for reporting purposes is not necessarily the most appropriate discount factor based on our cost of capital and the risks associated with our business and the oil and natural gas industry in general.  The proved bitumen reserves information included in this report has also been derived from engineering estimates. Reserves related to mining operations are defined as that part of a mineral deposit which could be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination. Proved reserves are measured by various testing and sampling methods. Bitumen reserves as of December 31, 2008 were estimated by third-party consultants, using volumetric estimation techniques similar to those used in estimating liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves and are subject to many of the same uncertainties discussed above, except that estimates of bitumen reserves are based on average annual prices consistent with industry practice in Canada. The estimated quantity of net proved bitumen reserves is based on a number of assumptions, including (among others) commodity prices, volumes in-place, presently known physical data, recoverability of bitumen, industry economic conditions, levels of cash flow from operations and other operating considerations. To the extent these assumptions prove inaccurate, actual recoveries could be different than current estimates. Future proved bitumen reserve revisions could also result from changes in, among other things, governmental regulation and taxation.  If we are unsuccessful in acquiring or finding additional reserves, our future liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas production would decline, thereby reducing our cash flows and results of operations and impairing our financial condition.  The rate of production from liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas properties generally declines as reserves are depleted. Except to the extent we acquire interests in additional properties containing proved reserves, conduct successful exploration and development activities or, through engineering studies, optimize production     26    Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements  performance, identify additional reservoirs not currently producing or secondary recovery reserves, our proved reserves will decline materially as liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas are produced. Accordingly, to the extent we are not successful in replacing the liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas we produce, our future revenues will decline. Creating and maintaining an inventory of prospects for future production depends on many factors, including:        •    obtaining rights to explore for, develop and produce liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas in promising areas;        •    drilling success;        •    the ability to complete long lead-time, capital-intensive projects timely and on budget;        •    the ability to find or acquire additional proved reserves at acceptable costs; and        •    the ability to fund such activity.  The availability of crude oil and increases in crude oil prices may reduce our refining, marketing and transportation profitability and refining and wholesale marketing gross margins.  The profitability of our refining, marketing and transportation operations depends largely on the margin between the cost of crude oil and other feedstocks that we refine and the selling prices we obtain for refined products. We are a net purchaser of crude oil. A significant portion of our crude oil is purchased from various foreign national oil companies, producing companies and trading companies, including suppliers from the Middle East. These purchases are subject to political, geographic and economic risks and possible terrorist activities attendant to doing business with suppliers located in that area of the world. Our overall refining, marketing and transportation profitability could be adversely affected by the availability of supply and rising crude oil and other feedstock prices which we do not recover in the marketplace. Refining and wholesale marketing gross margins historically have been volatile and vary with the level of economic activity in the various marketing areas, the regulatory climate, logistical capabilities and the available supply of refined products.  We will continue to incur substantial capital expenditures and operating costs as a result of compliance with, and changes in environmental health, safety and security laws and regulations, and, as a result, our profitability could be materially reduced.  Our businesses are subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, including those relating to the discharge of materials into the environment, waste management, pollution prevention measures, greenhouse gas emissions, and characteristics and composition of gasoline and diesel fuels, as well as laws and regulations relating to public and employee safety and health and facility security. We have incurred and will continue to incur substantial capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures as a result of these laws and regulations. To the extent these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services, our operating results will be adversely affected. The specific impact of these laws and regulations on us and our competitors may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of operating facilities, marketing areas and production processes. We may also be required to make material expenditures to modify operations, install pollution control equipment, perform site cleanups or curtail operations. We may become subject to liabilities that we currently do not anticipate in connection with new, amended or more stringent requirements, stricter interpretations of existing requirements or the future discovery of contamination. In addition, any failure by us to comply with existing or future laws could result in civil or criminal fines and other enforcement actions against us.  We believe it is likely that the scientific and political attention to issues concerning the extent, causes of and responsibility for climate change will continue, with the potential for further regulations that could affect our operations. Currently, various legislative and regulatory measures to address greenhouse gas emissions (including carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxides) are in various phases of review, discussion or implementation in the United States, Canada and European Union. These include proposed federal legislation and state actions to develop statewide or regional programs, each of which could impose reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. These actions could result in increased costs to (1) operate and maintain our facilities, (2) install new emission controls at our refineries and other facilities and (3) administer and manage any potential greenhouse gas emissions or carbon tax program. Although uncertain, these developments could increase our costs, reduce the demand for the products we sell and create delays in our obtaining air pollution permits for new or modified facilities. Our operations and those of our predecessors could expose us to civil claims by third parties for alleged liability resulting from contamination of the environment or personal injuries caused by releases of hazardous     27    Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements  substances. For example, we have been, and presently are, a defendant in various litigation and other proceedings involving products liability and other claims related to alleged contamination of groundwater with the oxygenate methyl tertiary butyl ether, or MTBE. We may become involved in further litigation or other proceedings, or we may be held responsible in existing or future litigation or proceedings, the costs of which could be material.  Environmental laws are subject to frequent change and many of them have become more stringent. In some cases, they can impose liability for the entire cost of cleanup on any responsible party, without regard to negligence or fault, and impose liability on us for the conduct of others or conditions others have caused, or for our acts that complied with all applicable requirements when we performed them.  In 2007, the U.S. Congress passed the Energy Independence and Security Act (“EISA”), which, among other things, sets a target of 35 miles per gallon for the combined fleet of cars and light trucks in the United States by model year 2020, and contains a multiple-part Renewable Fuel Standard (“RFS”). The RFS was 9.0 billion gallons of renewable fuel in 2008, and is 11.1 billion gallons in 2009, increasing to 36.0 billion gallons by 2022. In the near term, the RFS will be satisfied primarily with fuel ethanol blended into gasoline. The RFS presents production and logistics challenges for both the fuel ethanol and petroleum refining industries. The RFS has required, and may in the future continue to require, additional capital expenditures or expenses by us to accommodate increased fuel ethanol use. The advanced biofuels programs will present specific challenges in that we may have to enter into arrangements with other parties to meet our obligations to use advanced biofuels, including biomass-based diesel and cellulosic biofuel, with potentially uncertain supplies of these new fuels. There will be compliance costs and uncertainties regarding how we will comply with the various requirements contained in this law and related regulations. We may experience a decrease in demand for refined petroleum products due to an increase in combined fleet mileage per gallon or due to refined petroleum products being replaced by renewable fuels. In addition, tax incentives and other subsidies have made renewable fuels more competitive with refined products than they otherwise would have been which may have reduced and may further reduce refined product margins and refined products’ ability to compete with renewable fuels.  The recent distress in the financial markets may impact our ability to obtain future financing and could adversely affect entities with which we do business.   In the future we may require financing to grow our business. Financial institutions participate in our revolving credit facility and provide us with business insurance coverage, cash management services, commercial letters of credit and short-term investments. The recent distress affecting the financial markets and the possibility that financial institutions may consolidate or go bankrupt has reduced levels of activity in the credit markets. This could diminish the amount of financing available to companies. In addition, such turmoil in the financial markets could significantly increase our costs associated with borrowing. Our liquidity and our ability to access the credit or capital markets may also be adversely affected by changes in the financial markets and the global economy. Continuing turmoil in the financial markets could make it more difficult for us to access capital, sell assets, refinance our existing indebtedness, enter into agreements for new indebtedness or obtain funding through the issuance of our securities. In addition, there could be a number of follow-on effects from the credit crisis on us, including insolvency of customers, key suppliers and other counterparties to our commodity and foreign exchange derivative instruments.  Worldwide political and economic developments could damage our operations and materially reduce our profitability and cash flows.  Local political and economic factors in international markets could have a material adverse effect on us. A total of 63 percent of our liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas sales volumes in 2008 was derived from production outside the United States and 70 percent of our proved liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves as of December 31, 2008, were located outside the United States. All of our bitumen production and proved reserves are located in Canada. In addition, a significant portion of the feedstock requirements for our refineries is satisfied through supplies originating in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Canada, Mexico and various other foreign countries. We are, therefore, subject to the political, geographic and economic risks and possible terrorist activities attendant to doing business with suppliers located in, and supplies originating from, those areas. There are many risks associated with operations in international markets, including changes in foreign governmental policies relating to liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas, bitumen or refined product pricing and taxation, other political, economic or diplomatic developments and international monetary fluctuations. These risks include:        •    political and economic instability, war, acts of terrorism and civil disturbances;        •    the possibility that a foreign government may seize our property with or without compensation, may attempt to renegotiate or revoke existing contractual arrangements or may impose additional taxes or royalty burdens; and        •    fluctuating currency values, hard currency shortages and currency controls.    28    Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Continued hostilities in the Middle East and the occurrence or threat of future terrorist attacks could adversely affect the economies of the United States and other developed countries. A lower level of economic activity could result in a decline in energy consumption, which could cause our revenues and margins to decline and limit our future growth prospects. These risks could lead to increased volatility in prices for liquid hydrocarbons, natural gas and refined products. In addition, these risks could increase instability in the financial and insurance markets and make it more difficult for us to access capital and to obtain the insurance coverage that we consider adequate.  Actions of governments through tax and other legislation, executive order and commercial restrictions could reduce our operating profitability, both in the United States and abroad. The U.S. government can prevent or restrict us from doing business in foreign countries. These restrictions and those of foreign governments have in the past limited our ability to operate in, or gain access to, opportunities in various countries and will continue to do so in the future.  Our operations are subject to business interruptions and casualty losses, and we do not insure against all potential losses and therefore we could be seriously harmed by unexpected liabilities.  Our exploration and production operations are subject to unplanned occurrences, including blowouts, explosions, fires, loss of well control, spills, hurricanes and other adverse weather, labor disputes and accidents. Our oil sands mining operations are subject to business interruptions due to breakdown or failure of equipment or processes and unplanned events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions or other interruptions. In addition, our refining, marketing and transportation operations are subject to business interruptions due to scheduled refinery turnarounds and unplanned events such as explosions, fires, pipeline ruptures or other interruptions, crude oil or refined product spills, severe weather and labor disputes. Our operations are also subject to the additional hazards of pollution, releases of toxic gas and other environmental hazards and risks, as well as hazards of marine operations, such as capsizing, collision, acts of piracy and damage or loss from severe weather conditions. These hazards could result in serious personal injury or loss of human life, significant damage to property and equipment, environmental pollution, impairment of operations and substantial losses to us. Certain hazards have adversely affected us in the past, and damages resulting from a catastrophic occurrence in the future involving us or any of our assets or operations may result in our being named as a defendant in one or more lawsuits asserting potentially large claims or being assessed potentially substantial fines by governmental authorities.  We maintain insurance against many, but not all, potential losses or liabilities arising from operating hazards in amounts that we believe to be prudent. Uninsured losses and liabilities arising from operating hazards could reduce the funds available to us for capital, exploration and investment spending and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Historically, we have maintained insurance coverage for physical damage and resulting business interruption to our major onshore and offshore facilities, with significant self-insured retentions. In the future, we may not be able to maintain or obtain insurance of the type and amount we desire at reasonable rates. As a result of market conditions, premiums and deductibles for certain of our insurance policies have increased substantially and could escalate further. In some instances, certain insurance could become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. For example, due to hurricane activity in recent years, the availability of insurance coverage for our offshore facilities for windstorms in the Gulf of Mexico region has been reduced or, in many instances, it is prohibitively expensive. As a result, our exposure to losses from future windstorm activity in the Gulf of Mexico region has increased.  Litigation by private plaintiffs or government officials could adversely affect our performance.  We currently are defending litigation and anticipate that we will be required to defend new litigation in the future. The subject matter of such litigation may include releases of hazardous substances from our facilities, products liability, consumer credit or privacy laws, product pricing or antitrust laws or any other laws or regulations that apply to our operations. While an adverse outcome in most litigation matters would not be expected to be material to us, in some cases the plaintiff or plaintiffs seek alleged damages involving large classes of potential litigants, and may allege damages relating to extended periods of time or other alleged facts and circumstances. If we are not able to successfully defend such claims, they may result in substantial liability. We do not have insurance covering all of these potential liabilities. There has been a trend in recent years of litigation by attorneys general and other government officials seeking to recover civil damages from companies. We are defending litigation of that type and anticipate that we will be required to defend new litigation of that type in the future. In addition to substantial liability, litigation may also seek injunctive relief which could have an adverse effect on our future operations.    29    Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements If Ashland fails to pay its taxes, we could be responsible for satisfying various tax obligations of Ashland.   As a result of the transactions in which we acquired the minority interest in MPC from Ashland in 2005, Marathon is severally liable for federal income taxes (and in some cases for certain state taxes) of Ashland for tax years still open as of the date we completed the transactions. We have entered into a tax matters agreement with Ashland, which provides that:        •    We will be responsible for the tax liabilities of the Marathon group of companies, including the tax liabilities of MPC and the other companies and businesses we acquired in the transactions (for periods after the completion of the transactions); and        •    Ashland will generally be responsible for the tax liabilities of the Ashland group of companies before the completion of the transactions, and the income taxes attributable to Ashland’s interest in MPC before the completion of the transactions. However, under certain circumstances we will have several liability for those tax liabilities owed by Ashland to various taxing authorities, including the Internal Revenue Service.  If Ashland fails to pay any tax obligation for which we are severally liable, we may be required to satisfy this tax obligation. That would leave us in the position of having to seek indemnification from Ashland. In that event, our indemnification claims against Ashland would constitute general unsecured claims, which would be effectively subordinate to the claims of secured creditors of Ashland, and we would be subject to collection risk associated with collecting unsecured debt from Ashland.  We are required to pay Ashland for deductions relating to various contingent liabilities of Ashland, which could be material.  We are required to claim tax deductions for certain contingent liabilities that will be paid by Ashland after completion of the transactions. Under the tax matters agreement, we are required to pay the benefit of those deductions to Ashland, with the computation and payment terms for such tax benefit payments divided into two “baskets,” as described below:  Basket One – This applies to the first $30 million of contingent liability deductions (increased by inflation each year up to a maximum of $60 million) that we may claim in each year for the first 20 years following the acquisition. The benefit of Basket One deductions is determined by multiplying the amount of the deduction by 32 percent (or, if different, by a percentage equal to three percentage points less than the highest federal income tax rate during the applicable tax year). We are obligated to pay this amount to Ashland. The computation and payment of Basket One amounts does not depend on our ability to generate actual tax savings from the use of the contingent liability deductions in Basket One. Upon specified events related to Ashland (or after 20 years), the contingent liability deductions that would otherwise have been compensated under Basket One will be taken into account in Basket Two. In addition, Basket One applies only for federal income tax purposes; state, local or foreign tax benefits attributable to specified liability deductions will be compensated only under Basket Two.  Because we are required to make payments to Ashland whether or not we generate any actual tax savings from the Basket One contingent liability deductions, the amount of our tax benefit payments to Ashland with respect to Basket One contingent liability deductions may exceed the aggregate tax benefits that we derive from these deductions. We are obligated to make these payments to Ashland even if we do not have sufficient taxable income to realize any benefit for the deductions.  Basket Two – All contingent liability deductions relating to Ashland’s pre-transactions operations that are not subject to Basket One are considered and compensated under Basket Two. The benefit of Basket Two deductions is determined on a “with and without” basis; that is, the contingent liability deductions are treated as the last deductions used by the Marathon group. Thus, if the Marathon group has deductions, tax credits or other tax benefits of its own, it will be deemed to use them to the maximum extent possible before it will be deemed to use the contingent liability deductions. To the extent that we have the capacity to use the contingent liability deductions based on this methodology, the actual amount of tax saved by the Marathon group through the use of the contingent liability deductions will be calculated and paid to Ashland. Because Basket Two amounts are calculated based on the actual tax saved by the Marathon group from the use of Basket Two deductions, those amounts are subject to recalculation in the event there is a change in the Marathon group’s tax liability for a particular year. This could occur because of audit adjustments or carrybacks of losses or credits from other years, for example. To the extent that such a recalculation results in a smaller Basket Two benefit with respect to a contingent liability deduction for which Ashland has already received compensation, Ashland is required to repay     30    Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements  such compensation to Marathon. In the event we become entitled to any repayment, we would be subject to collection risks associated with collecting an unsecured claim from Ashland.  If the transactions resulting in our acquisition of the minority interest in MPC that was previously owned by Ashland were found to constitute a fraudulent transfer or conveyance, we could be required to provide additional consideration to Ashland or to return a portion of interest in MPC, and either of those results could have a material adverse effect on us.   In a bankruptcy case or lawsuit initiated by one or more creditors or a representative of creditors of Ashland, a court may review our 2005 transactions with Ashland under state fraudulent transfer or conveyance laws. Under those laws, the transactions would be deemed fraudulent if the court determined that the transactions were undertaken for the purpose of hindering, delaying or defrauding creditors or that the transactions were constructively fraudulent. If the transactions were found to be a fraudulent transfer or conveyance, we might be required to provide additional consideration to Ashland or to return all or a portion of the interest in MPC and the other assets we acquired from Ashland.  Under the laws of most states, a transaction could be held to be constructively fraudulent if a court determined that:        •    the transferor received less than “reasonably equivalent value” or, in some jurisdictions, less than “fair consideration” or “valuable consideration”; and        •    the transferor:        •    was insolvent at the time of the transfer or was rendered insolvent by the transfer;        •    was engaged, or was about to engage, in a business or transaction for which its remaining property constituted unreasonably small capital; or        •    intended to incur, or believed it would incur, debts beyond its ability to pay as those debts matured.  In connection with our transactions with Ashland completed in 2005, we delivered part of the overall consideration (specifically, shares of Marathon common stock having a value of $915 million) to Ashland’s shareholders. In order to help establish that Ashland received reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration from us in the transactions, we obtained a written opinion from a nationally recognized appraisal firm to the effect that Ashland received amounts that were reasonably equivalent to the combined value of Ashland’s interest in MPC and the other assets we acquired. We also obtained a favorable opinion from that appraisal firm relating to various financial tests that supported our conclusion and Ashland’s representation to us that Ashland was not insolvent either before or after giving effect to the closing of the transactions. Those opinions were based on specific information provided to the appraisal firm and were subject to various assumptions, including assumptions relating to Ashland’s existing and contingent liabilities and insurance coverage. Although we are confident in our conclusions regarding (1) Ashland’s receipt of reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration and (2) Ashland’s solvency, it should be noted that the valuation of any business and a determination of the solvency of any entity involve numerous assumptions and uncertainties, and it is possible that a court could disagree with our conclusions.  If United States Steel fails to perform any of its material obligations to which we have financial exposure, we could be required to pay those obligations, and any such payment could materially reduce our cash flows and profitability and impair our financial condition.  In connection with the separation of United States Steel from Marathon, United States Steel agreed to hold Marathon harmless from and against various liabilities. While we cannot estimate some of these liabilities, the portion of these liabilities that we can estimate amounts to $513 million as of December 31, 2008, including accrued interest of $8 million. If United States Steel fails to satisfy any of those obligations, we would be required to satisfy them and seek indemnification from United States Steel. In that event, our indemnification claims against United States Steel would constitute general unsecured claims, effectively subordinate to the claims of secured creditors of United States Steel.  The steel business is highly competitive and a large number of industry participants have sought protection under bankruptcy laws in the past. The enforceability of our claims against United States Steel could become subject to the effect of any bankruptcy, fraudulent conveyance or transfer or other law affecting creditors’ rights generally, or of general principles of equity, which might become applicable to those claims or other claims arising from the facts and circumstances in which the separation was effected.    31    Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Many of our major projects and operations are conducted with partners, which may decrease our ability to manage risk.  We often enter into arrangements to conduct certain business operations, such oil and gas exploration and production or pipeline transportation, with partners in order to share risks associated with those operations. However, these arrangements also may decrease our ability to manage risks and costs, particularly those where we are not the operator. We could have limited influence over and control of the behaviors and performance of these operations. This could affect our operational performance, financial position and reputation.  We may issue preferred stock whose terms could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of Marathon common stock.  Our restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such preferences, powers and relative, participating, optional and other rights, including preferences over Marathon common stock respecting dividends and distributions, as our Board of Directors generally may determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of Marathon common stock. For example, we could grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the common stock.      Item 1B.
