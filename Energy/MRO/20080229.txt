PART I       Item 1. Business  General  Marathon Oil Corporation was originally organized in 2001 as USX HoldCo, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the former USX Corporation. As a result of a reorganization completed in July 2001, USX HoldCo, Inc. (1) became the parent entity of the consolidated enterprise (the former USX Corporation was merged into a subsidiary of USX HoldCo, Inc.) and (2) changed its name to USX Corporation. In connection with the transaction described in the next paragraph (the “Separation”), USX Corporation changed its name to Marathon Oil Corporation.  Before December 31, 2001, Marathon had two outstanding classes of common stock: USX-Marathon Group common stock, which was intended to reflect the performance of our energy business, and USX-U.S. Steel Group common stock (“Steel Stock”), which was intended to reflect the performance of our steel business. On December 31, 2001, we disposed of our steel business through a tax-free distribution of the common stock of our wholly-owned subsidiary United States Steel Corporation (“United States Steel”) to holders of Steel Stock in exchange for all outstanding shares of Steel Stock on a one-for-one basis.  In connection with the Separation, our certificate of incorporation was amended on December 31, 2001 and Marathon has had only one class of common stock authorized since that date.  On June 30, 2005, we acquired the 38 percent ownership interest in Marathon Ashland Petroleum LLC (“MAP”) previously held by Ashland Inc. (“Ashland”). In addition, we acquired a portion of Ashland’s Valvoline Instant Oil Change business, its maleic anhydride business, its interest in LOOP LLC which owns and operates the only U.S. deepwater oil port, and its interest in LOCAP LLC which owns a crude oil pipeline. As a result of the transactions, MAP is wholly owned by Marathon and its name was changed to Marathon Petroleum Company LLC (“MPC”) effective September 1, 2005.  Acquisition of Western Oil Sands Inc.  On October 18, 2007, we completed the acquisition of all the outstanding shares of Western Oil Sands Inc. (“Western”) for cash and securities of $5.833 billion. Western’s debt was $1.063 billion at closing. Western’s primary asset was a 20 percent outside-operated interest in the Athabasca Oil Sands Project (“AOSP”), an oil sands mining joint venture located in the province of Alberta, Canada. The acquisition was accounted for under the     2    Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements  purchase method of accounting and, as such, our results of operations include Western’s results from October 18, 2007. Western’s oil sands mining and bitumen upgrading operations are reported as a separate Oil Sands Mining segment, while its ownership interests in leases where in-situ recovery techniques are expected to be utilized are included in the Exploration and Production segment.  Segment and Geographic Information  Our operations consist of four operating segments: 1) Exploration and Production (“E&P”) – explores for, produces and markets liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas on a worldwide basis; 2) Oil Sands Mining (“OSM”) – mines, extracts and transports bitumen from oil sands deposits in Alberta, Canada, and upgrades the bitumen to produce and market synthetic crude oil and by-products; 3) Refining, Marketing and Transportation (“RM&T”) – refines, markets and transports crude oil and petroleum products, primarily in the Midwest, upper Great Plains, Gulf Coast and southeastern regions of the United States; and 4) Integrated Gas (“IG”) – markets and transports products manufactured from natural gas, such as liquefied natural gas (“LNG”) and methanol, on a worldwide basis, and is developing other projects to link stranded natural gas resources with key demand areas. For operating segment and geographic financial information, see Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements.  Exploration and Production  In the discussion that follows regarding our exploration and production operations, references to “net” wells, sales or investment indicate our ownership interest or share, as the context requires.  We conduct exploration, development and production activities in 11 countries. Principal exploration activities are in the United States, Angola, Norway and Indonesia. Principal development and production activities are in the United States, the United Kingdom, Norway, Ireland, Equatorial Guinea and Libya.  Our 2007 worldwide net liquid hydrocarbon sales averaged 197 thousand barrels per day (“mbpd”). Our 2007 worldwide net natural gas sales, including natural gas acquired for injection and subsequent resale, averaged 925 million cubic feet per day (“mmcfd”). In total, our 2007 worldwide net sales averaged 351 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (“mboepd”). (For purposes of determining barrels of oil equivalent (“boe”), natural gas volumes are converted to approximate liquid hydrocarbon barrels by dividing the natural gas volumes expressed in thousands of cubic feet (“mcf”) by six. The liquid hydrocarbon volume is added to the barrel equivalent of natural gas volume to obtain boe.) In 2008, our worldwide net liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas sales are expected to average 380 to 420 mboepd, excluding future acquisitions and dispositions.  The above projections of 2008 worldwide net liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas sales are forward-looking statements. Some factors that could potentially affect levels of sales include pricing, supply and demand for petroleum products, the amount of capital available for exploration and development, regulatory constraints, timing of commencing production from new wells, drilling rig availability, inability to obtain or delay in obtaining necessary government and third-party approvals and permits, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, acts of war or terrorist acts and the governmental or military response, and other geological, operating and economic considerations. These factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.  Exploration  In the United States during 2007, we drilled 59 gross (39 net) exploratory wells of which 47 gross (29 net) wells encountered commercial quantities of hydrocarbons. Of these 47 wells, none were temporarily suspended or in the process of being completed at year end. Internationally, we drilled 25 gross (6 net) exploratory wells of which 16 gross (4 net) wells encountered commercial quantities of hydrocarbons. Of these 16 wells, 10 gross (3 net) wells were temporarily suspended or were in the process of being completed at December 31, 2007.  United States – The Gulf of Mexico continues to be a core area for us. At the end of 2007, we had interests in 71 blocks in the Gulf of Mexico, including 64 in the deepwater area. In October 2007, we were the high bidder on 27 blocks offered in the federal Outer Continental Shelf Lease Sale No. 205 conducted by the U.S. Minerals Management Service (“MMS”) and were awarded these leases in early 2008. Representing a total net investment of $222 million for us, 13 blocks were bid 100 percent by us, and the remaining 14 blocks were bid in conjunction with partners. Our plans call for initial drilling on some of these leases in 2009 or 2010. The contract for the rig has an initial term of two years with an option to extend for an additional two years.    3    Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements In 2007, we drilled the Droshky (previously named Troika Deep) deepwater discovery well. This well and two appraisal sidetrack wells are located on Green Canyon Block 244 in the Gulf of Mexico and we are in the process of drilling additional appraisal wells. We have secured an additional year of drilling rig capacity in 2009 for development drilling in anticipation of a 2008 project sanction. The timing of initial production from the Droshky discovery will be dependent upon delivery of key equipment and regulatory approvals, but could be as early as 2010. We hold a 100 percent working interest in the Drohsky discovery.  In late 2007, drilling of an appraisal well began on the Stones prospect (Walker Ridge Block 508) after a 2005 discovery. We hold a 30 percent outside-operated interest in the Stones prospect.  In 2001, a successful discovery well was drilled on the Ozona prospect (Garden Banks Block 515) in the Gulf of Mexico and, in 2002, two sidetrack wells were drilled. We are continuing to evaluate options to develop the Ozona prospect. Commercial terms have been secured for the tie-back and processing of Ozona production and we have been actively searching for a rig to drill the development well. We hold a 68 percent operated interest in the Ozona prospect.  Angola – Offshore Angola, we hold a 10 percent outside-operated interest in Block 31 and a 30 percent outside-operated interest in Block 32. Through February 2008, 27 discoveries on these blocks have been announced, including eight in 2007 and one in early 2008. These discoveries represent four potential development hubs. Four discoveries and one successful appraisal well form a planned development area in the northeastern portion of Block 31. Nine other discoveries on Block 31 comprise potential development areas in the southeast and middle portions of the block. Seven of the Block 32 discoveries form our first potential development in the eastern area of that block.  Norway – We hold interests in over 800,000 gross acres offshore Norway and plan to continue our exploration effort there. We hold a 28 percent outside-operated interest in the Gudrun field, located 120 miles off the coast of Norway, where we are focused on subsurface evaluation and assessing development concepts after a successful appraisal well in 2006. First production from Gudrun is expected in 2012. In 2007, we also continued to advance exploration opportunities in the Alvheim area, the first of which is expected to be drilled in 2009.  Indonesia – We are the operator and hold a 70 percent interest in the Pasangkayu Block offshore Indonesia. The 1.2 million acre block is located mostly in deep water, predominantly offshore of the island of Sulawesi in the Makassar Strait, directly east of the Kutei Basin production region. The production sharing contract with the Indonesian government was signed in 2006 and we will begin collecting geophysical data in the first quarter of 2008. We expect to begin exploratory drilling in 2009.  In addition, we were awarded two study agreements and farmed into additional study agreements in Indonesia in 2007 which could lead to the acquisition of new leaseholds at a future lease sale.  Equatorial Guinea – During 2004, we announced the Deep Luba and Gardenia discoveries on the Alba Block, in which we hold a 63 percent operated interest, and the Corona well on Block D, where we are the operator with a 90 percent interest. These wells are part of our long-term LNG strategy. We expect these discoveries to be developed when the natural gas supply from the nearby Alba Field starts to decline or additional LNG markets are entered that require increased natural gas supply.  Libya – We hold a 16 percent outside-operated interest in the Waha concessions, which encompass almost 13 million acres located in the Sirte Basin. Our exploration program in 2007 included the drilling of eight wells, six of which were successful. Most of these discoveries extended previously defined hydrocarbon accumulations.  Canada – We hold interests in both operated and outside-operated exploration-stage in-situ oil sand leases as a result of the acquisition of Western in 2007.  United Kingdom – During 2007, we acquired a 45 percent outside-operated interest in three exploratory onshore coal bed methane licenses in the United Kingdom, representing 128,000 gross acres. Three exploration wells have been drilled on two of the licenses and additional delineation and production testing is planned during 2008. We also plan to participate in the U.K. Onshore Licensing Round during 2008 to secure additional acreage.  In the U.K. portion of the North Sea, Marathon participated in a discovery in Block 204/23 adjacent to the Foinaven field. This Foinaven Southwest discovery encountered hydrocarbons and will be considered for a potential tieback to the nearby infrastructure.    4    Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Ukraine – In 2007, we signed a cooperation agreement with a Ukrainian partner to carry out a study in the Dneiper-Donets Basin in north central Ukraine. The joint study will be conducted over three years on an area of joint interest covering 10,000 square miles and could lead to the joint exploration for hydrocarbons.  Production (including development activities)  United States – Our U.S. operations accounted for 32 percent of our 2007 worldwide net liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes and 52 percent of our worldwide net natural gas sales volumes.  During 2007, our net sales in the Gulf of Mexico averaged 25 mbpd of liquid hydrocarbons, representing 39 percent of our total U.S. net liquid hydrocarbon sales, and 28 mmcfd of natural gas, representing 6 percent of our total U.S. net natural gas sales. Net liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas sales in the Gulf of Mexico decreased from the prior year, mainly due to normal production rate declines. At year-end 2007, we held interests in seven producing fields and eight platforms in the Gulf of Mexico, of which we operate four platforms.  The majority of our sales volumes in the Gulf of Mexico come from the Petronius development in Viosca Knoll Blocks 786 and 830. We own a 50 percent outside-operated working interest in these blocks. The Petronius platform provides processing and transportation services to adjacent third-party fields. For example, Petronius processes the production from our Perseus field which commenced production in April 2005 and is located five miles from the platform.  We hold a 30 percent outside-operated working interest in the Neptune deepwater development on Atwater Valley Blocks 573, 574, 575, 617 and 618 in the Gulf of Mexico, 120 miles off the coast of Louisiana. The development plan for Neptune was sanctioned in 2005 and includes seven subsea wells tied back to a stand-alone mini-tension leg platform. Construction of the platform and facility continued through 2007 with first production expected at the end of the first quarter of 2008.  We believe that we are one of the largest natural gas producers in the Cook Inlet and adjacent Kenai Peninsula of Alaska. In 2007, our net natural gas sales from Alaska averaged 142 mmcfd, representing 30 percent of our total U.S. net natural gas sales volumes. Our natural gas sales from Alaska are seasonal in nature, trending down during the second and third quarters of each year and increasing during the fourth and first quarters. To manage supplies to meet contractual demand we produce and store natural gas in a partially depleted reservoir in the Kenai natural gas field.  Net liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas sales from our Wyoming fields averaged 20 mbpd and 114 mmcfd in 2007. Our Wyoming net natural gas sales decreased from the prior year primarily as a result of natural field declines, partially offset by new wells in the Wamsutter and Powder River Basin areas. Development of the Powder River Basin continued in 2007 with 170 operated wells drilled, which was up from the 119 wells drilled in 2006. Additional development of our southwest Wyoming interests continued in 2007 where we participated in the drilling of 30 wells.  We also have domestic natural gas operations in Oklahoma, east Texas and north Louisiana, with combined net sales of 148 mmcfd in 2007, and liquid hydrocarbon operations in the Permian Basin of southeast New Mexico and west Texas, with net sales of 12 mbpd in 2007.  We hold 320,000 acres in the Williston Basin (the Bakken shale formation) following the acquisition of an additional 70,000 acres in late 2007. The majority of the acreage is located in North Dakota with the remainder in eastern Montana. This represents a substantial position in the Bakken shale with approximately 350 locations to be drilled over the next four to five years. We currently have six operated drilling rigs running in our Bakken shale program and ended 2007 with a net production rate of 2,600 barrels of oil equivalent per day.  We hold a natural gas leasehold in the Piceance Basin of Colorado, located in Garfield County in the Greater Grand Valley field complex. The acreage is located near adjacent production. Our plans include drilling approximately 700 wells in the next ten years. Drilling and production commenced in late 2007.    5    Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements United Kingdom – Our largest asset in the U.K. sector of the North Sea is the Brae area complex where we are the operator and have a 42 percent working interest in the South, Central, North and West Brae fields and a 38 percent working interest in the East Brae field. The Brae A platform and facilities host the underlying South Brae field and the adjacent Central and West Brae fields. The North Brae field, which is produced via the Brae B platform, and the East Brae field, which is produced via the East Brae platform, are natural gas condensate fields. Our share of liquid hydrocarbon sales from the Brae area averaged 14 mbpd in 2007. Our share of Brae natural gas sales averaged 139 mmcfd, or 31 percent of our international natural gas sales volumes, in 2007 and decreased from the prior year as a result of natural field declines in the North and East Brae natural gas condensate fields.  The strategic location of the Brae platforms along with pipeline and onshore infrastructure has generated third-party processing and transportation business since 1986. Currently, the operators of 28 third-party fields have contracted to use the Brae system. In addition to generating processing and pipeline tariff revenue, this third-party business also has a favorable impact on Brae area operations by optimizing infrastructure usage and extending the economic life of the complex.  The Brae group owns a 50 percent interest in the outside-operated Scottish Area Gas Evacuation (“SAGE”) system. The SAGE pipeline transports natural gas from the Brae area and the third-party Beryl area and has a total wet natural gas capacity of 1.1 billion cubic feet (“bcf”) per day. The SAGE terminal at St. Fergus in northeast Scotland processes natural gas from the SAGE pipeline and almost 1 bcf per day of third-party natural gas from the Britannia, Atlantic and Cromarty fields.  In the U.K. Atlantic Margin, we own an approximate 30 percent working interest in the outside-operated Foinaven area complex, consisting of a 28 percent working interest in the main Foinaven field, 47 percent working interest in East Foinaven and 20 percent working interest in the T35 and T25 fields. Our share of sales from the Foinaven fields averaged 17 mbpd of liquid hydrocarbons and 9 mmcfd of natural gas in 2007.  Norway – Norway is a strategic and growing core area, which complements our long-standing operations in the U.K. sector of the North Sea discussed above. We were approved for our first operatorship on the Norwegian continental shelf in 2002, where today we operate eight licenses.  We are the operator of the Alvheim complex located on the Norwegian Continental Shelf. This development is comprised of the Kameleon and Kneler discoveries, in which we have a 65 percent working interest, and the Boa discovery, in which we have a 58 percent working interest. The complex consists of a floating production, storage and offloading vessel (“FPSO”) with subsea infrastructure. Produced oil will be transported by shuttle tanker and produced natural gas will be transported to the SAGE system using a new 14-inch, 24-mile cross border pipeline. The multipurpose shuttle tanker that has been modified to serve as the FPSO sailed from the shipyard in mid-February 2008 to undergo testing, after which it will proceed offshore for connection to the subsea infrastructure. The Alvheim development will initially include ten producing wells and two water disposal wells in the drilling program, which will continue through the fourth quarter of 2008. The nearby Vilje discovery, in which we own a 47 percent outside-operated working interest, will also be produced through the Alvheim FPSO. The two Vilje development wells were drilled and completed in 2007. First production from the Alvheim/Vilje development is expected at the end of the first quarter of 2008, weather permitting.  In early 2007, the Norwegian government approved a plan for development and operation to develop the Volund field as a subsea tie-back to the Alvheim FPSO. The Volund development will consist of one production well and one water disposal well, both of which will be drilled in the first half of 2009 with an additional two wells to be drilled in the latter part of 2009. The produced oil will be exported via the shuttle tankers discussed above, and the associated natural gas will be exported via the Alvheim-to-SAGE pipeline. The Volund development, in which we own a 65 percent working interest and serve as operator, is expected to begin production in 2009.  During 2007, net liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas sales in Norway from the Heimdal, Vale and Skirne fields averaged 2 mbpd and 29 mmcfd. We own a 24 percent outside-operated working interest in the Heimdal field, a 47 percent outside-operated working interest in the Vale field and a 20 percent outside-operated working interest in the Skirne field.  Ireland – We own a 100 percent working interest in the Kinsale Head, Ballycotton and Southwest Kinsale natural gas fields and an 87 percent operated working interest in the Seven Heads natural gas field in the Celtic Sea offshore Ireland. Net natural gas sales in Ireland were 39 mmcfd in 2007. In June 2006, we were awarded the first commercial natural gas storage license in Ireland, which allows us to provide full third-party storage services from the Southwest Kinsale field. The unit has a total working volume of 7 bcf per annum. Both indigenous     6    Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements  Kinsale natural gas and natural gas imported from a transmission system are injected and withdrawn from the facility under contractual arrangements that expire in April 2009. Additionally, natural gas produced from our other fields or purchased from other parties can be stored at Southwest Kinsale for future sale to customers.  We own a 19 percent working interest in the outside-operated Corrib natural gas development project, located 40 miles off Ireland’s northwest coast, where six of the seven wells necessary to develop the field have been drilled. Two wells have been completed, and three additional wells are planned to be completed in 2008. The main 20-inch offshore pipeline installation is also planned for 2008. Terminal construction is underway. The operator expects first production from the field in the fourth quarter of 2009.  Equatorial Guinea – We own a 63 percent operated working interest in the Alba field offshore Equatorial Guinea and a 52 percent interest in an onshore liquefied petroleum gas (“LPG”) processing plant held through an equity method investee. During 2007, net liquid hydrocarbon sales averaged 45 mbpd, or 34 percent of our international liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes, and net natural gas sales averaged 228 mmcfd, or 51 percent of our international natural gas sales volumes. Net liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes in 2007 included 33 mbpd of condensate and 12 mbpd of LPG.  As part of our Integrated Gas segment, we own 45 percent of Atlantic Methanol Production Company LLC (“AMPCO”) and 60 percent of Equatorial Guinea LNG Holdings Limited (“EGHoldings”). AMPCO operates a methanol plant and EGHoldings operates an LNG production facility, both located on Bioko Island. Alba field dry natural gas, which remains after the condensate and LPG are removed, is supplied to both of these facilities. During 2007, a gross 130 mmcfd of dry natural gas was supplied to the methanol plant and a gross 268 mmcfd of dry gas was supplied to the LNG production facility. Any remaining dry gas is returned offshore and reinjected into the Alba reservoir for later production.  Libya – Net liquid hydrocarbon sales in Libya averaged 45 mbpd in 2007 compared to 54 mbpd in 2006, of which a total of 8 mbpd were owed to our account upon the resumption of our operations in Libya. The 2007 net liquid hydrocarbon sales in Libya represented 34 percent of our international liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes. Net natural gas sales in Libya averaged 4 mmcfd in 2007.  Gabon – We are the operator of the Tchatamba South, Tchatamba West and Tchatamba Marin fields offshore Gabon with a 56 percent working interest. Net sales in Gabon averaged 10 mbpd of liquid hydrocarbons in 2007. Production from these three fields is processed on a single offshore facility at Tchatamba Marin, with the processed oil being transported through an offshore and onshore pipeline to an outside-operated storage facility.  Other Matters  We hold an interest in an exploration and production license in Sudan. We suspended all operations in Sudan in 1985 due to civil unrest. We have had no employees in the country and have derived no economic benefit from those interests since that time. The U.S. government imposed sanctions against Sudan in 1997 and we have not made any payments related to Sudan since then. We have abided and will continue to abide by all U.S. sanctions related to Sudan. We have reached an agreement to transfer our interest in this license to the operator. Governmental approval of this transfer is expected in the first quarter of 2008.  We discovered the Ash Shaer and Cherrife natural gas fields in Syria in the 1980s. We have recognized no revenues in any period from activities in Syria and we impaired our entire investment in Syria in 1998. In 2006, the Syrian government approved the assignment of 90 percent of our interest in the Ash Shaer and Cherrife natural gas fields to a non-U.S. company. We closed the transaction on November 1, 2006, and received cash proceeds of $46 million. The remaining 10 percent interest was assigned to the same company on December 21, 2007, for $5 million.  The above discussion of the E&P segment includes forward-looking statements with respect to anticipated future exploratory and development drilling, the possibility of developing the Gudrun field offshore Norway, Blocks 31 and 32 offshore Angola, the Foinaven Southwest discovery in the U.K. portion of the North Sea and the Equatorial Guinea discoveries, the possibility of obtaining access to new leaseholds in Indonesia and additional coal bed methane licenses in the United Kingdom, joint exploration for hydrocarbons in the Ukraine and the timing of production from the Droshky discovery, the Gudrun discovery, the Neptune development, the Alvheim/Vilje development, the Volund field and the Corrib project. Some factors which could potentially affect these forward-looking statements include pricing, supply and demand for petroleum products, the amount of capital available for exploration and development, regulatory constraints, drilling rig availability, unforeseen hazards     7    Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements  such as weather conditions, acts of war or terrorist acts and the governmental or military response, and other geological, operating and economic considerations. Except for the Neptune, Alvheim/Vilje and Volund developments, the foregoing forward-looking statements may be further affected by the inability to obtain or delay in obtaining necessary government and third-party approvals and permits. The possible developments on the Gudrun field, Blocks 31 and 32 offshore Angola, the Foinaven Southwest discovery and the Equatorial Guinea discoveries could further be affected by presently known data concerning size and character of reservoirs, economic recoverability, future drilling success and production experience. Factors that could affect joint exploration for hydrocarbons in the Ukraine include results of technical studies and continued favorable investment climate. The above discussion of the E&P segment also includes forward-looking statements with respect to our intention to exit a license in Sudan which could be potentially impacted by a delay in receiving governmental approval. The foregoing factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.  Reserves  At December 31, 2007, our net proved liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves totaled 1.225 billion boe, of which 42 percent were located in Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (“OECD”) countries. The following table sets forth estimated quantities of net proved liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves at the end of each of the last three years.

Proved developed liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves represented 72 percent of total proved reserves as of December 31, 2007, as compared to 68 percent as of December 31, 2006. Of the 346 million boe of proved undeveloped reserves at year-end 2007, 58 percent of the volume is associated with projects that have been included in proved reserves for more than three years while 17 percent of the proved undeveloped reserves were added during 2007.  During 2007, we added a total of 88 million boe of net proved liquid hydrocarbon and natural reserves, principally in Libya, Norway and the Piceance Basin of Colorado. We disposed of 0.2 million boe, while producing     8    Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements  125 million boe. Of the total net proved reserve additions, 38 million boe were proved developed and 50 million boe were proved undeveloped reserves. During 2007, we transferred 109 million boe from proved undeveloped to proved developed reserves. Costs incurred for the periods ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 relating to the development of proved undeveloped liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves, were $1.250 billion, $1.010 billion and $955 million. As of December 31, 2007, estimated future development costs relating to the development of proved undeveloped liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves for the years 2008 through 2010 are projected to be $859 million, $376 million and $293 million.  The above estimated quantities of net proved liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves and estimated future development costs relating to the development of proved undeveloped liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves are forward-looking statements and are based on a number of assumptions, including (among others) commodity prices, presently known physical data concerning size and character of the reservoirs, economic recoverability, technology developments, future drilling success, industry economic conditions, levels of cash flow from operations, production experience and other operating considerations. To the extent these assumptions prove inaccurate, actual recoveries and development costs could be different than current estimates.  For a discussion of the proved liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserve estimation process, see Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Critical Accounting Estimates – Estimated Net Recoverable Reserve Quantities – Proved Liquid Hydrocarbon and Natural Gas Reserves, and for additional details of the estimated quantities of proved reserves at the end of each of the last three years, see Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Supplementary Information on Oil and Gas Producing Activities – Estimated Quantities of Proved Oil and Natural Gas Reserves. We filed reports with the U.S. Department of Energy (“DOE”) for 2006 disclosing our total year-end estimated liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves. The year-end estimates reported to the DOE are the same estimates reported in the Supplementary Information on Oil and Gas Producing Activities.  Delivery Commitments  We sell liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas under a variety of contractual arrangements, some of which specify the delivery of a fixed and determinable quantity. Worldwide, we are contractually committed to deliver 180 bcf of natural gas in the future. These contracts have various expiration dates through the year 2018. Our proved reserves in Alaska, the United Kingdom and other locations, are sufficient to fulfill these delivery commitments.

The joint venture produces bitumen from certain oil sands deposits in the Athabasca region and upgrades the bitumen to synthetic crude oil. The AOSP’s initial asset is the mining and extraction operations of the Muskeg River mine located 45 miles north of Fort McMurray, Alberta,     11    Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements  which began bitumen production in 2003, together with upgrading infrastructure located northeast of Edmonton, Alberta. The underlying developed leases are held for the duration of the project, with royalties paid to the province. As of December 31, 2007, we have rights to participate in developed and undeveloped leases totaling 46,000 net acres. We are entitled to participate in future expansion opportunities on other nearby oil sands leases owned by the operator and, prior to December 6, 2009, on any new lands acquired by either of the other AOSP owners within a defined area of mutual interest.  Current AOSP operations use established processes to mine oil sands deposits from an open-pit mine, extract the bitumen and upgrade it into high-quality, synthetic crude oils. Bitumen production from the mine is taken by pipeline to the Scotford upgrader, which uses hydro-conversion technology to upgrade the bitumen into two streams of synthetic crude oil (Premium Albian Synthetic and Albian Heavy Synthetic) and vacuum gas oil. The vacuum gas oil is sold to the operator under a long-term contract for use in its refinery adjacent to the upgrading facility. When the AOSP is operating at its current capacity, our net bitumen production is 30 mbpd, but operations were curtailed at the Scotford upgrader subsequent to the Western acquisition date due to a mid-November fire. Maintenance work originally scheduled for the first quarter of 2008 was performed in conjunction with the necessary repairs. The Scotford upgrader returned to operation in late December. Net bitumen production averaged 4 mbpd for 2007, based on total volumes from the October 18, 2007 acquisition date over total days in the year. Bitumen production averaged 19 mbpd for the post-acquisition period.  As of December 31, 2007, our net proved bitumen reserves were estimated to be 421 million barrels. Proved reserves can be added as expansions are permitted, funding is approved and certain stipulations of the joint venture agreement are satisfied.  In 2006, the first fully-integrated expansion of the existing AOSP facilities was approved. The Phase 1 expansion includes construction of mining and extraction facilities at the Jackpine mine, expansion of treatment facilities at the existing Muskeg River mine and expansion of the Scotford upgrader, along with construction of common infrastructure sized to support future mining expansions. The AOSP Phase 1 expansion is under construction and we anticipate that it will be complete in late 2010. Work is underway to determine the feasibility of additional AOSP expansion projects including pursuing regulatory approvals.  The above estimated quantity of net proved bitumen reserves is a forward-looking statement and is based on a number of assumptions, including (among others) commodity prices, volumes in-place, presently known physical data, recoverability of bitumen, industry economic conditions, levels of cash flow from operations, and other operating considerations. To the extent these assumptions prove inaccurate, actual recoveries could be different than current estimates. For a discussion of the proved bitumen reserves estimation process, see Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Critical Accounting Estimates – Estimated Net Recoverable Reserve Quantities – Proved Bitumen Reserves. Operations at the AOSP are outside the scope of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 25, “Suspension of Certain Accounting Requirements for Oil and Gas Producing Companies (an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 19),” SFAS No. 69, “Disclosures about Oil and Gas Producing Activities (an Amendment of FASB Statements 19, 25, 33 and 39),” and Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) Rule 4-10 of Regulation S-X; therefore, bitumen production and reserves are not included in our Supplementary Information on Oil and Gas Producing Activities.  The above discussion of the Oil Sands Mining segment includes forward-looking statements concerning the anticipated completion of the AOSP expansion project. Factors which could affect the project include transportation logistics, availability of material and labor, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, delays in obtaining or conditions imposed by necessary government and third-party approvals and other risks associated with construction projects.  Refining, Marketing and Transportation  Refining  We own and operate seven refineries with an aggregate refining capacity of 1.016 million barrels per day (“mmbpd”) of crude oil. During 2007, our refineries processed 1.010 mmbpd of crude oil and 214 mbpd of other charge and blend stocks. The table below sets forth the location and daily throughput capacity of each of our refineries as of December 31, 2007. These capacity amounts increased from 974 mbpd in 2006 due to overall efficiency gains in the operation of the refining units, reflecting the cumulative effect of regular maintenance, capital improvements and other process optimization efforts.    12    Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Crude Oil Refining Capacity        (Thousands of barrels per day)        Garyville, Louisiana   256   Catlettsburg, Kentucky   226   Robinson, Illinois   204   Detroit, Michigan   102   Canton, Ohio   78   Texas City, Texas   76   St. Paul Park, Minnesota   74         TOTAL   1,016  Our refineries include crude oil atmospheric and vacuum distillation, fluid catalytic cracking, catalytic reforming, desulfurization and sulfur recovery units. The refineries can process a wide variety of crude oils and produce typical refinery products, including reformulated and low-sulfur gasolines and ultra-low sulfur diesel fuel. We also produce asphalt cements, polymerized asphalt, asphalt emulsions and industrial asphalts. We manufacture petroleum pitch, primarily used in the graphite electrode, clay target and refractory industries. Additionally, we manufacture aromatics, aliphatic hydrocarbons, cumene, base lube oil, polymer grade propylene, maleic anhydride and slack wax.  Our refineries are integrated via pipelines, terminals and barges to maximize operating efficiency. The transportation links that connect our refineries allow the movement of intermediate products to optimize operations and the production of higher margin products. For example, naphtha may be moved from Texas City to Robinson where excess reforming capacity is available. Also, by shipping intermediate products between facilities during partial refinery shutdowns, we are able to utilize processing capacity that is not directly affected by the shutdown work.  Planned maintenance activities requiring temporary shutdown of certain refinery operating units, or turnarounds, are periodically performed at each refinery. We completed fluid catalytic cracking unit turnarounds at our Catlettsburg, Robinson and St. Paul Park refineries in 2007.  The following table sets forth our refinery production by product group for each of the last three years.

Construction commenced in early 2007 and continues on schedule with additional project construction phases commencing in early 2008. We expect to complete the expansion in late 2009. In 2007, we approved a heavy oil upgrading and expansion project at our Detroit, Michigan refinery, at a projected cost of $1.9 billion (excluding capitalized interest). This project will enable the refinery to process additional heavy, sour crude oils, including Canadian bitumen blends, and will increase its crude oil refining capacity by about 15 percent. Construction is expected to begin in the first half of 2008, subject to obtaining necessary environmental permits, and is expected to be completed in late 2010. When completed, these two expansion projects will increase our current total crude oil refining capacity by 19 percent.  Marketing  We are a supplier of gasoline and distillates to resellers and consumers within our market area in the Midwest, upper Great Plains, Gulf Coast and southeastern regions of the United States. In 2007, our refined products sales volumes totaled 21.6 billion gallons, or 1.410 mmbpd. The average sales price of our refined     13    Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements  products in aggregate was $86.53 per barrel for 2007. The following table sets forth our refined products sales by product group and our average sales price for each of the last three years.

On April 1, 2006, we changed our accounting for matching buy/sell arrangements as a result of a new accounting standard. This change resulted in lower refined products sales volumes for 2007 and the remainder of 2006 than would have been reported under our previous accounting practices. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.  The wholesale distribution of petroleum products to private brand marketers and to large commercial and industrial consumers and sales in the spot market accounted for 69 percent of our refined products sales volumes in 2007. We sold 49 percent of our gasoline volumes and 89 percent of our distillates volumes on a wholesale or spot market basis. Half of our propane is sold into the home heating market, with the balance being purchased by industrial consumers. Propylene, cumene, aromatics, aliphatics and sulfur are domestically marketed to customers in the chemical industry. Base lube oils, maleic anhydride, slack wax, extract and pitch are sold throughout the United States and Canada, with pitch products also being exported worldwide. We market asphalt through owned and leased terminals throughout the Midwest, upper Great Plains, Gulf Coast and southeastern regions of the United States. Our customer base includes approximately 750 asphalt-paving contractors, government entities (states, counties, cities and townships) and asphalt roofing shingle manufacturers.  We have blended ethanol with gasoline for over 15 years and increased our blending program in 2007, in part due to renewable fuel mandates. We blended 41 mbpd of ethanol into gasoline in 2007 and 35 mbpd in both 2006 and 2005. The future expansion or contraction of our ethanol blending program will be driven by the economics of the ethanol supply and changes in government regulations. We sell reformulated gasoline in parts of our marketing territory, primarily Chicago, Illinois; Louisville, Kentucky; northern Kentucky; Milwaukee, Wisconsin and Hartford, Illinois, and we sell low-vapor-pressure gasoline in nine states. We also sell biodiesel in Minnesota, Illinois and Kentucky.  As of December 31, 2007, we supplied petroleum products to about 4,400 Marathon branded-retail outlets located primarily in Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, Kentucky and Illinois. Branded retail outlets are also located in Georgia, Florida, Minnesota, Wisconsin, North Carolina, Tennessee, West Virginia, Virginia, South Carolina, Alabama, Pennsylvania, and Texas. Sales to Marathon-brand jobbers and dealers accounted for 16 percent of our refined product sales volumes in 2007.  Speedway SuperAmerica LLC (“SSA”), our wholly-owned subsidiary, sells gasoline and diesel fuel primarily through retail outlets that we operate. Sales of refined products through these SSA retail outlets accounted for 15 percent of our refined products sales volumes in 2007. As of December 31, 2007, SSA had 1,636 retail outlets in nine states that sold petroleum products and convenience store merchandise and services, primarily under the brand names “Speedway” and “SuperAmerica.” SSA’s revenues from the sale of non-petroleum merchandise totaled $2.796 billion in 2007, compared with $2.706 billion in 2006. Profit levels from the sale of such merchandise and services tend to be less volatile than profit levels from the retail sale of gasoline and diesel fuel. SSA also operates 59 Valvoline Instant Oil Change retail outlets located in Michigan and northwest Ohio.  Pilot Travel Centers LLC (“PTC”), our joint venture with Pilot Corporation (“Pilot”), is the largest operator of travel centers in the United States with 286 locations in 37 states and Canada at December 31, 2007. The travel centers offer diesel fuel, gasoline and a variety of other services, including on-premises brand-name restaurants at many locations. Pilot and Marathon each own a 50 percent interest in PTC.    14    Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Our retail marketing strategy is focused on SSA’s Midwest operations, additional growth of the Marathon brand and continued growth for PTC.  Supply and Transportation  We obtain most of the crude oil we refine from negotiated contracts and purchases or exchanges on the spot market. In 2007, U.S.-sourced crude oil averaged 527 mbpd, or 52 percent, of the crude oil processed at our refineries, including a net 15 mbpd from our production operations included in the E&P segment. Canada was the source for 14 percent, or 138 mbpd, of crude oil processed in 2007. Other foreign sources supplied 34 percent, or 345 mbpd, of the crude oil processed by our refineries, including 180 mbpd from the Middle East. This crude oil was acquired from various foreign national oil companies, producing companies and trading companies. The following table provides information on the sources of crude oil for each of the last three years.  Sources of Crude Oil Refined               (Thousands of barrels per day)   2007   2006   2005   United States     527     470     447   Canada     138     130     111   Middle East and Africa     253     266     301   Other International     92     114     114                       TOTAL     1,010     980     973   Average cost of crude oil throughput (Dollars per barrel)   $ 71.20   $ 61.15   $ 51.85  We operate a system of pipelines, terminals and barges to provide crude oil to our refineries and refined products to our marketing areas. At December 31, 2007, we owned, leased, operated or held equity method investments in 68 miles of crude oil gathering lines, 3,717 miles of crude oil trunk lines and 3,860 miles of refined products trunk lines.  Excluding equity method investees, our owned or operated common carrier pipelines transported the volumes shown in the following table for each of the last three years.

Our 85 owned and operated light product and asphalt terminals are strategically located throughout the Midwest, upper Great Plains and southeastern United States. In October 2007, we executed an agreement to purchase four light product terminals in Ohio and an ownership interest in a refined product pipeline. This transaction is expected to close by the end of the second quarter of 2008, pending completion of various pre-closing activities, including obtaining necessary government approvals.  Our marine transportation operations include 15 towboats and 182 barges that transport refined products on the Ohio, Mississippi and Illinois rivers, their tributaries and the Intercoastal Waterway. We lease and own over 2,500 rail cars of various sizes and capacities for movement and storage of petroleum products and over 150 tractors and tank trailers.  Ethanol Production  In 2007, we acquired a 35 percent interest in an entity which owns and operates a 110-million-gallon-per-year ethanol facility in Clymers, Indiana, and continued construction of another 110-million-gallon-per-year ethanol facility in Greenville, Ohio. The Greenville plant, in which we own a 50 percent interest, began production in February 2008. Both of these facilities are managed by our partner, The Andersons, Inc. and will enable us to maintain the reliability of a portion of our future ethanol supplies.  The above discussion of the RM&T segment includes forward-looking statements concerning the expansion of the Garyville refinery and the Detroit refinery heavy oil upgrading and expansion project. Some factors that could affect those projects include transportation logistics, availability of materials and labor, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, delays in obtaining or conditions imposed by necessary government and third-party approvals and other risks customarily associated with construction projects. The above discussion also includes forward-looking statements concerning the purchase of four terminals and an interest in a pipeline which is subject to customary closing conditions and may be affected by the inability or delay in obtaining necessary regulatory approvals and other operating and economic considerations. These factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.  Integrated Gas  Our integrated gas operations include natural gas liquefaction and regasification operations and methanol production operations. Also included in the financial results of the Integrated Gas segment are the costs associated with ongoing development of projects to link stranded natural gas resources with key demand areas.  LNG Operations  We hold a 60 percent interest in EGHoldings, which is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. In May 2007, EGHoldings completed construction of a 3.7 million metric tonnes per annum (“mmtpa”) LNG production facility on Bioko Island and delivered its first cargo of LNG. LNG from the production facility is sold under a 3.4 mmtpa, or 460 mmcfd, sales and purchase agreement with a 17-year term. The purchaser under the agreement takes delivery of the LNG on an FOB Bioko Island basis, with pricing linked principally to the Henry Hub index, regardless of destination. This production facility allows us to monetize our natural gas reserves from the Alba field, as natural gas for the facility is purchased from the Alba field participants under a long-term natural gas supply agreement. Sales of LNG from this production facility totaled 1,464,088 metric tonnes in 2007.  In 2007 we completed those portions of the front-end engineering and design (“FEED”) required to support the near-term efforts related to a potential second LNG production facility on Bioko Island, Equatorial Guinea. The scope of the FEED work for the potential 4.4 mmtpa LNG project included feed gas metering, liquefaction, refrigeration, ethylene storage, boil-off gas compression, product transfer to storage and LNG product metering. We expect to make progress towards an investment decision in 2008.    16    Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements We also own a 30 percent interest in a Kenai, Alaska, natural gas liquefaction plant, which is accounted for under the equity method of accounting, and have an undivided interest in a long-term lease for two 87,500 cubic meter tankers used to transport LNG to customers in Japan. Feedstock for the plant is supplied from a portion of our natural gas production in the Cook Inlet. From the first production in 1969, we have sold our share of the LNG plant’s production under long-term contract with two of Japan’s largest utility companies. This contract continues through March 2009, with 2007 LNG deliveries totaling 48 bcf. In January 2007, along with our partner, we filed a request with the DOE to extend the export license for this natural gas liquefaction plant through March 2011. This application has received favorable support from the State of Alaska but still requires final DOE approval.  In April 2004, we began delivering LNG cargoes at the Elba Island, Georgia LNG regasification terminal pursuant to an LNG sales and purchase agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, we have the right to deliver and sell up to 58 bcf of natural gas (as LNG) per year, through March 31, 2021, with a possible extension to November 30, 2023. In September 2004, we signed an agreement under which we will be supplied with 58 bcf of natural gas per year, as LNG, for a minimum period of five years. The agreement allows for delivery of LNG at the Elba Island LNG regasification terminal with pricing linked to the Henry Hub index. This supply agreement enables us to fully utilize our rights at Elba Island during the period of this agreement, while affording us the flexibility to commercialize other stranded natural gas resources beyond the term of this contract. The agreement commenced in 2005.  Methanol Operations  We own a 45 percent interest in AMPCO, which is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. AMPCO owns a methanol plant located in Malabo, Equatorial Guinea. Feedstock for the plant is supplied from our natural gas production from the Alba field. Sales of methanol from the plant totaled 1,060,653 metric tonnes in 2007. Production from the plant is used to supply customers in Europe and the United States.  Natural Gas Technology  We invest in natural gas technology research, including proprietary Gas-To-Fuels™ (“GTF”) technology which offers the ability to convert natural gas into premium fuels while bypassing conventional intermediate synthetic gasification technology. The base patent for this technology was awarded in 2007. We have designed and are constructing a 10-bpd demonstration facility for this technology, with initial startup scheduled for the second half of 2008. Expectations for the demonstration plant include the ability to demonstrate operations of the fully integrated process at a practical scale and to measure the conversion efficiencies of the total process, catalyst performance and materials durability. This critical performance data will support scale-up cost estimates for a commercial installation and provide the basis for continued technical developments in this area. In addition to GTF, we continue to evaluate the application of other natural gas technologies, including LNG technology enhancements, gas hydrates and gas-to-liquids (“GTL”) technology.  The above discussion of the Integrated Gas segment contains forward-looking statements with respect to the possible expansion of the LNG production facility and expectations for a GTF demonstration facility. Factors that could potentially affect the possible expansion of the LNG production facility include partner and government approvals, access to sufficient natural gas volumes through exploration or commercial negotiations with other resource owners and access to sufficient regasification capacity. Factors that could potentially affect the GTF demonstration facility include construction delays, start-up difficulties relating to scale-up in the process and unforeseen difficulties in our testing program related to moving from laboratory to practical scale. The foregoing factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.  Competition and Market Conditions  Strong competition exists in all sectors of the oil and gas industry and, in particular, in the exploration for and development of new reserves. We compete with major integrated and independent oil and gas companies, as well as national oil companies, for the acquisition of oil and natural gas leases and other properties. We compete with these companies for the equipment and labor required to develop and operate those properties and in the marketing of oil and natural gas to end-users. Many of our competitors have financial and other resources greater than those available to us. Acquiring the more attractive exploration opportunities frequently requires competitive bids involving front-end bonus payments or commitments-to-work programs. We also compete in attracting and retaining personnel, including geologists, geophysicists and other specialists. Based on industry sources, we rank eighth among U.S.-based petroleum companies on the basis of 2006 worldwide liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas production.    17    Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements We also compete with other producers of synthetic and conventional crude oil for the sale of our synthetic crude oil to refineries in North America. There are several additional synthetic crude oil projects being contemplated by various competitors and, if undertaken and completed, these projects may result in a significant increase in the supply of synthetic crude oil to the market. In addition, not all refineries are able to process or refine synthetic crude oil. There can be no assurance that sufficient market demand will exist at all times to absorb our share of the synthetic crude oil production from the AOSP at economically viable prices.  We must also compete with a large number of other companies to acquire crude oil for refinery processing and in the distribution and marketing of a full array of petroleum products. We rank fifth among U.S. petroleum companies on the basis of U.S. crude oil refining capacity as of December 31, 2007. We compete in four distinct markets – wholesale, spot, branded and retail distribution – for the sale of refined products. We believe we compete with about 40 companies in the wholesale distribution of petroleum products to private brand marketers and large commercial and industrial consumers; about 75 companies in the sale of petroleum products in the spot market; ten refiner/marketers in the supply of branded petroleum products to dealers and jobbers; and approximately 275 petroleum product retailers in the retail sale of petroleum products. We compete in the convenience store industry through SSA’s retail outlets. The retail outlets offer consumers gasoline, diesel fuel (at selected locations) and a broad mix of other merchandise and services. Some locations also have on-premises brand-name restaurants such as Subway™. We also compete in the travel center industry through our 50 percent ownership in PTC.  Our operating results are affected by price changes in conventional and synthetic crude oil, natural gas and petroleum products, as well as changes in competitive conditions in the markets we serve. Generally, results from production and oil sands mining operations benefit from higher crude oil prices while the refining and wholesale marketing gross margin may be adversely affected by crude oil price increases. Price differentials between sweet and sour crude oil also affect operating results. Market conditions in the oil and gas industry are cyclical and subject to global economic and political events and new and changing governmental regulations.  The Separation  On December 31, 2001, pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization dated as of July 31, 2001, Marathon completed the Separation, in which:        •    its wholly-owned subsidiary United States Steel LLC converted into a Delaware corporation named United States Steel Corporation and became a separate, publicly traded company; and        •    USX Corporation changed its name to Marathon Oil Corporation.  As a result of the Separation, Marathon and United States Steel are separate companies and neither has any ownership interest in the other.  In connection with the Separation and pursuant to the Plan of Reorganization, Marathon and United States Steel have entered into a series of agreements governing their relationship after the Separation and providing for the allocation of tax and certain other liabilities and obligations arising from periods before the Separation. The following is a description of the material terms of two of those agreements.  Financial Matters Agreement  Under the financial matters agreement, United States Steel has assumed and agreed to discharge all of our principal repayment, interest payment and other obligations under the following, including any amounts due on any default or acceleration of any of those obligations, other than any default caused by us:        •    obligations under industrial revenue bonds related to environmental projects for current and former U.S. Steel Group facilities, with maturities ranging from 2009 through 2033;        •    sale-leaseback financing obligations under a lease for equipment at United States Steel’s Fairfield Works facility, with a lease term to 2012, subject to extensions;        •    obligations relating to various lease arrangements accounted for as operating leases and various guarantee arrangements, all of which were assumed by United States Steel; and    18    Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements     •    certain other guarantees.  The financial matters agreement also provides that, on or before the tenth anniversary of the Separation, United States Steel will provide for our discharge from any remaining liability under any of the assumed industrial revenue bonds. United States Steel may accomplish that discharge by refinancing or, to the extent not refinanced, paying us an amount equal to the remaining principal amount of all accrued and unpaid debt service outstanding on, and any premium required to immediately retire, the then outstanding industrial revenue bonds.  Under the financial matters agreement, United States Steel has all of the existing contractual rights under the leases assumed from us, including all rights related to purchase options, prepayments or the grant or release of security interests. However, United States Steel has no right to increase amounts due under or lengthen the term of any of the assumed lease obligations without our prior consent other than extensions set forth in the terms of the assumed leases.  The financial matters agreement also requires United States Steel to use commercially reasonable efforts to have us released from our obligations under a guarantee we provided with respect to all of United States Steel’s obligations under a partnership agreement between United States Steel, as general partner, and General Electric Credit Corporation of Delaware and Southern Energy Clairton, LLC, as limited partners. United States Steel may dissolve the partnership under certain circumstances, including if it is required to fund accumulated cash shortfalls of the partnership in excess of $150 million. In addition to the normal commitments of a general partner, United States Steel has indemnified the limited partners for certain income tax exposures.  The financial matters agreement requires us to use commercially reasonable efforts to assure compliance with all covenants and other obligations to avoid the occurrence of a default or the acceleration of the payments on the assumed obligations. The agreement also obligates us to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and maintain letters of credit and other liquidity arrangements required under the assumed obligations.  United States Steel’s obligations to us under the financial matters agreement are general unsecured obligations that rank equal to United States Steel’s accounts payable and other general unsecured obligations. The financial matters agreement does not contain any financial covenants and United States Steel is free to incur additional debt, grant mortgages on or security interests in its property and sell or transfer assets without our consent.  Obligations Associated with the Separation as of December 31, 2007  See Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Obligations Associated with the Separation of United States Steel for a discussion of our obligations associated with the Separation.  Environmental Matters  The Public Policy Committee of our Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing our position on public issues, including environmental matters. Our Corporate Responsibility organization has the responsibility to ensure that our operating organizations maintain environmental compliance systems that are in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. Committees comprised of certain of our officers review our overall performance associated with various environmental compliance programs. We also have a Crisis Management Team, composed primarily of senior management, which oversees the response to any major emergency, environmental or other incident involving Marathon or any of our properties.  Legislation and regulations pertaining to climate change and greenhouse gas emissions have the potential to impact us. The Kyoto Protocol, effective in 2005, has been ratified by countries in which we have or in the future may have operations. Canadian federal and provincial laws, the U.S. Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, the European Union requirements and California laws contain provisions related to greenhouse gas emissions. Other climate change legislation and regulations both in the United States and abroad are in various stages of development. Our industry, and businesses throughout the United States, are also awaiting the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (“EPA”) actions upon the remand of the U.S. Supreme Court decision in Massachusetts v. USEPA which could have impacts on a number of air permitting and environmental regulatory programs. Our liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas and bitumen production and processing operations typically result in emissions of greenhouse gases. Likewise, emissions arise from our RM&T operations, including refining crude oil and transportation crude oil and refined products. Although there may be adverse financial impact (including     19    Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements  compliance costs, potential permitting delays and potential reduced demand for crude oil or certain products) associated with any legislation, regulation, EPA or other action, the extent and magnitude of impact cannot be reliably or accurately estimated due to newness of the requirements and the present uncertainty regarding the additional measures and how they will be implemented. As part of our commitment to environmental stewardship, we estimate and publicly report greenhouse gas emissions from our operations. We are working to continuously improve the accuracy and completeness of these estimates. In addition, we continuously strive to improve operational and energy efficiencies through resource and energy conservation where practicable and cost effective. Our businesses are also subject to numerous other laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. These environmental laws and regulations include the Clean Air Act (“CAA”) with respect to air emissions, the Clean Water Act (“CWA”) with respect to water discharges, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) with respect to solid and hazardous waste treatment, storage and disposal, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”) with respect to releases and remediation of hazardous substances and the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (“OPA-90”) with respect to oil pollution and response. In addition, many states where we operate have similar laws dealing with the same matters. New laws are being enacted and regulations are being adopted by various regulatory agencies on a continuing basis, and the costs of compliance with these new rules can only be broadly appraised until their implementation becomes more accurately defined. In some cases, they can impose liability for the entire cost of clean-up on any responsible party without regard to negligence or fault and impose liability on us for the conduct of others or conditions others have caused, or for our acts that complied with all applicable requirements when we performed them. The ultimate impact of complying with existing laws and regulations is not always clearly known or determinable because certain implementing regulations for some environmental laws have not yet been finalized or, in some instances, are undergoing revision. These environmental laws and regulations, particularly the 1990 Amendments to the CAA and its implementing regulations, new water quality requirements and stricter fuel regulations, could result in increased capital, operating and compliance costs.  For a discussion of environmental capital expenditures and costs of compliance for air, water, solid waste and remediation, see Legal Proceedings and Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Environmental Matters, Litigation and Contingencies.  Air  Of particular significance to our refining operations are EPA regulations that require reduced sulfur levels in diesel fuel for off-road use. We now plan to spend approximately $350 million between 2006 and 2012 on refinery investments to produce ultra-low sulfur diesel fuel for off-road use, in compliance with EPA regulations. This is a forward-looking statement. Some factors (among others) that could potentially affect these compliance costs include final investment decisions, completion of project detailed engineering, construction and start-up activities. Further, we previously estimated that we would spend approximately $400 million over a four-year period beginning in 2008 to comply with Mobile Source Air Toxics II regulations relating to benzene. We have not finalized our strategy or cost estimates to comply with these recently promulgated requirements, but the cost estimates will increase and may be approximately $1 billion over a three-year period beginning in 2008. The cost estimates have increased due to better definition of the projects needed to meet the requirements of the finalized regulations and updated construction cost estimates. The cost estimates are forward-looking statements and are subject to change as FEED work is completed in 2008.  The EPA is in the process of implementing regulations to address current National Ambient Air Quality Standards (“NAAQS”) for fine particulate emissions and ozone. In connection with these standards, the EPA will designate certain areas as “nonattainment,” meaning that the air quality in such areas does not meet the NAAQS. To address these nonattainment areas, the EPA proposed a rule in 2004 called the Interstate Air Quality Rule (“IAQR”) that would require significant emissions reductions in numerous states. The final rule, promulgated in 2005, was renamed the Clean Air Interstate Rule (“CAIR”). While the EPA expects that states will meet their CAIR obligations by requiring emissions reductions from electric generating units, states will have the final say on what sources they regulate to meet attainment criteria. Our refinery operations are located in affected states and some of these states may choose to propose more stringent fuels requirements to meet the CAIR. Also, on July 11, 2007, the EPA proposed a revised ozone standard. Once the revised ozone standard is promulgated, the EPA will begin the multi-year process to develop the implementing rules required by the Clean Air Act. We cannot reasonably estimate the final financial impact of the state actions to implement the CAIR until the states have taken further action and we cannot reasonably estimate the final financial impact of the revised ozone standard until the implementing rules are established.    20    Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Water  We maintain numerous discharge permits as required under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System program of the CWA and have implemented systems to oversee our compliance efforts. In addition, we are regulated under OPA-90, which amended the CWA. Among other requirements, OPA-90 requires the owner or operator of a tank vessel or a facility to maintain an emergency plan to respond to releases of oil or hazardous substances. Also, in case of such releases OPA-90 requires responsible companies to pay resulting removal costs and damages, provides for civil penalties and imposes criminal sanctions for violations of its provisions.  Additionally, OPA-90 requires that new tank vessels entering or operating in U.S. waters be double hulled and that existing tank vessels that are not double-hulled be retrofitted or removed from U.S. service, according to a phase-out schedule. All of the barges used for river transport of our raw materials and refined products meet the double-hulled requirements of OPA-90. We operate facilities at which spills of oil and hazardous substances could occur. Several coastal states in which we operate have passed state laws similar to OPA-90, but with expanded liability provisions, including provisions for cargo owner responsibility as well as ship owner and operator responsibility. We have implemented emergency oil response plans for all of our components and facilities covered by OPA-90 and we have established Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasures (“SPCC”) plans for facilities subject to CWA SPCC requirements.  Solid Waste  We continue to seek methods to minimize the generation of hazardous wastes in our operations. The RCRA establishes standards for the management of solid and hazardous wastes. Besides affecting waste disposal practices, RCRA also addresses the environmental effects of certain past waste disposal operations, the recycling of wastes and the regulation of underground storage tanks (“USTs”) containing regulated substances. We have ongoing RCRA treatment and disposal operations at one of our RM&T facilities and primarily utilize offsite third-party treatment and disposal facilities. Ongoing RCRA-related costs, however, are not expected to be material. In addition, Canada will be implementing a ban on the land application of certain wastes and we are reviewing options to treat or dispose of these wastes consistent with these new restrictions.  Remediation  We own or operate certain retail outlets where, during the normal course of operations, releases of petroleum products from USTs have occurred. Federal and state laws require that contamination caused by such releases at these sites be assessed and remediated to meet applicable standards. The enforcement of the UST regulations under RCRA has been delegated to the states, which administer their own UST programs. Our obligation to remediate such contamination varies, depending on the extent of the releases and the stringency of the laws and regulations of the states in which we operate. A portion of these remediation costs may be recoverable from the appropriate state UST reimbursement funds once the applicable deductibles have been satisfied. We also have other facilities which are subject to remediation under federal or state law. See Legal Proceedings – Environmental Proceedings – Other Proceedings for a discussion of these sites.  Other Matters  The Energy Policy Act of 2005 established a Renewable Fuel Standard (“RFS”) providing that all gasoline sold in the United States contain a minimum of 4.0 billion gallons of renewable fuel in 2006. The RFS increases gradually each year until 2012, when the RFS will be 7.5 billion gallons of renewable fuel. The EPA issued a final rule in May 2007 and the program went into effect on September 1, 2007. We have put the necessary systems in place to track and report our compliance with these requirements.    The recently-passed Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 contains multiple RFSs. The overall requirement starts with 9.0 billion gallons of renewable fuel required in 2008 and ramps up to 36.0 billion gallons in 2022. Inside of the overall requirement is an advanced biofuels mandate which begins in 2009 and increases to 21.0 billion gallons by 2022. Subsets within the advanced biofuels requirements require 1.0 billion gallons of biomass-based diesel fuel by 2012 and 16.0 billion gallons of cellulosic ethanol by 2022. The EPA has not yet issued a proposal and a final rule to implement this program. This program presents specific challenges in that a refiner like us may have to enter into arrangements with other parties to meet its obligations to use advanced biofuels and cellulosic ethanol if it cannot produce these fuels itself. We may also experience a decrease in demand of our current refinery-produced petroleum products to the extent they are replaced by advanced biofuels and cellulosic     21    Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements  ethanol and overall demand does not increase to replace this loss. There will be compliance costs and uncertainties regarding how we will comply with the mandates contained in this law and rule, but the extent and magnitude of impact cannot be reliably or accurately estimated due to the uncertainty of these measures at this time. We are and will be developing potential strategies for compliance with such requirements.  Employees  We had 29,524 active employees as of December 31, 2007. Of that number, 19,578 were employees of SSA, most of who were employed at our retail marketing outlets.  Certain hourly employees at our Catlettsburg and Canton refineries are represented by the United Steel, Paper and Forestry, Rubber, Manufacturing, Energy, Allied Industrial and Service Workers Union under labor agreements that expire on January 31, 2009. The same union represents certain hourly employees at our Texas City refinery under a labor agreement that expires on March 31, 2009. The International Brotherhood of Teamsters represents certain hourly employees under labor agreements that are scheduled to expire on May 31, 2009 at our St. Paul Park refinery and January 31, 2010 at our Detroit refinery.  Executive Officers of the Registrant  The executive officers of Marathon and their ages as of February 1, 2008, are as follows:             Philip G.

Risk Factors  Marathon is subject to various risks and uncertainties in the course of its business. The following summarizes some, but not all, of the risks and uncertainties that may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.  A substantial or extended decline in liquid hydrocarbon or natural gas prices, as well as refining and wholesale marketing gross margins, would reduce our operating results and cash flows and could adversely impact our future rate of growth and the carrying value of our assets.  Prices for liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas and refining and wholesale marketing gross margins fluctuate widely. Our revenues, operating results and future rate of growth are highly dependent on the prices we receive for our liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas and the margins we realize on our refined products. Historically, the markets for liquid hydrocarbons, natural gas and refined products have been volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future. Many of the factors influencing prices of liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas and refining and wholesale marketing gross margins are beyond our control. These factors include:        •    worldwide and domestic supplies of and demand for liquid hydrocarbons, natural gas and refined products;        •    the cost of exploring for, developing and producing liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas;        •    the cost of crude oil to be manufactured into refined products;        •    the ability of the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to agree to and maintain production controls;        •    political instability or armed conflict in oil and natural gas producing regions;        •    changes in weather patterns and climatic changes;        •    natural disasters such as hurricanes and tornados;        •    the price and availability of alternative and competing fuels;        •    domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes; and        •    general economic conditions worldwide.  The long-term effects of these and other factors on the prices of liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas, as well as on refining and wholesale marketing gross margins, are uncertain.  Lower liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas prices, as well as lower refining and wholesale marketing gross margins, may reduce the amount of these commodities that we produce, which may reduce our revenues, operating income and cash flows. Significant reductions in liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas prices or refining and wholesale marketing gross margins could require us to reduce our capital expenditures or impair the carrying value of our assets.  Estimates of liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas and bitumen reserves depend on many factors and assumptions, including various assumptions that are based on conditions in existence as of the dates of the estimates. Any material changes in those conditions or other factors affecting those assumptions could impair the quantity and value of our liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas and bitumen reserves.  The proved liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves information included in this report has been derived from engineering estimates. Those estimates were prepared by our in-house teams of reservoir engineers and geoscience professionals and reviewed, on a selected basis, by our Corporate Reserves Group and/or third-party consultants we have retained. The estimates were calculated using liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas prices in effect as of December 31, 2007, as well as other conditions in existence as of that date. Any significant future price     24    Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements  changes will have a material effect on the quantity and present value of our proved liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves. Future reserve revisions could also result from changes in, among other things, governmental regulation and severance and other production taxes.  Proved liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserve estimation is a subjective process that involves estimating volumes to be recovered from underground accumulations of liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas that cannot be directly measured. Estimates of economically recoverable liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves and of future net cash flows depend upon a number of variable factors and assumptions, including:        •    location, size and shape of the accumulation as well as fluid, rock and producing characteristics of the accumulation;        •    historical production from the area, compared with production from other comparable producing areas;        •    the assumed effects of regulation by governmental agencies; and        •    assumptions concerning future operating costs, severance and excise taxes, development costs and workover and repair costs.  As a result, different petroleum engineers, each using industry-accepted geologic and engineering practices and scientific methods, may produce different estimates of proved liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves and future net cash flows based on the same available data. Because of the subjective nature of liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserve estimates, each of the following items may differ materially from the amounts or other factors estimated:        •    the amount and timing of liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas production;        •    the revenues and costs associated with that production; and        •    the amount and timing of future development expenditures.  The discounted future net revenues from our proved liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves reflected in this report should not be considered as the market value of the reserves attributable to our liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas properties. As required by SEC Rule 4-10 of Regulation S-X, the estimated discounted future net revenues from our proved liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves are based on prices and costs as of the date of the estimate, while actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower.  In addition, the 10 percent discount factor required by the applicable rules of the SEC to be used to calculate discounted future net revenues for reporting purposes is not necessarily the most appropriate discount factor based on our cost of capital and the risks associated with our business and the oil and natural gas industry in general.  The proved bitumen reserves information included in this report has also been derived from engineering estimates. Reserves related to mining operations are defined as that part of a mineral deposit which could be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination. Proved reserves are measured by various testing and sampling methods. Bitumen reserves as of December 31, 2007 were estimated by third-party consultants, using volumetric estimation techniques similar to those used in estimating liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves and are subject to many of the same uncertainties discussed above. The estimated quantity of net proved bitumen reserves is based on a number of assumptions, including (among others) commodity prices, volumes in-place, presently known physical data, recoverability of bitumen, industry economic conditions, levels of cash flow from operations and other operating considerations. To the extent these assumptions prove inaccurate, actual recoveries could be different than current estimates. Future proved bitumen reserve revisions could also result from changes in, among other things, governmental regulation and taxation.  If we are unsuccessful in acquiring or finding additional reserves, our future liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas production would decline, thereby reducing our cash flows and results of operations and impairing our financial condition.  The rate of production from liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas properties generally declines as reserves are depleted. Except to the extent we acquire interests in additional properties containing proved reserves, conduct successful exploration and development activities or, through engineering studies, optimize production     25    Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements  performance, identify additional reservoirs not currently producing or secondary recovery reserves, our proved reserves will decline materially as liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas are produced. Accordingly, to the extent we are not successful in replacing the liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas we produce, our future revenues will decline. Creating and maintaining an inventory of prospects for future production depends on many factors, including:        •    obtaining rights to explore for, develop and produce liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas in promising areas;        •    drilling success;        •    the ability to complete long lead-time, capital-intensive projects timely and on budget; and        •    the ability to find or acquire additional proved reserves at acceptable costs.  Increases in crude oil prices and environmental or other regulations may reduce our refining and wholesale marketing gross margins.  The profitability of our refining, marketing and transportation operations depends largely on the margin between the cost of crude oil and other feedstocks that we refine and the selling prices we obtain for refined products. We are a net purchaser of crude oil. A significant portion of our crude oil is purchased from various foreign national oil companies, producing companies and trading companies, including suppliers from the Middle East. These purchases are subject to political, geographic and economic risks attendant to doing business with suppliers located in that area of the world. Our overall RM&T profitability could be adversely affected by the availability of supply and rising crude oil and other feedstock prices which we do not recover in the marketplace. Refining and wholesale marketing gross margins historically have been volatile and vary with the level of economic activity in the various marketing areas, the regulatory climate, logistical capabilities and the available supply of refined products.  In addition, various regulations have imposed, and are expected to continue to impose, increasingly stringent and costly requirements on our refining, marketing and transportation operations, which may reduce our refining and wholesale marketing gross margins.  We will continue to incur substantial capital expenditures and operating costs as a result of compliance with, and changes in environmental laws and regulations, and, as a result, our profitability could be materially reduced.  Our businesses are subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. We have incurred and will continue to incur substantial capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures as a result of these laws and regulations. To the extent these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services, our operating results will be adversely affected. The specific impact of these laws and regulations on us and our competitors may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of operating facilities, marketing areas and production processes. We may also be required to make material expenditures to modify operations, install pollution control equipment, perform site cleanups or curtail operations. We may become subject to liabilities that we currently do not anticipate in connection with new, amended or more stringent requirements, stricter interpretations of existing requirements or the future discovery of contamination. In addition, any failure by us to comply with existing or future laws could result in civil or criminal fines and other enforcement actions against us.  We believe it is reasonably likely that the scientific and political attention to issues concerning the existence and extent of climate change will continue, with the potential for further regulations that could affect our operations. Although uncertain, these developments could increase costs or reduce the demand for the products we sell. Our operations and those of our predecessors could expose us to civil claims by third parties for alleged liability resulting from contamination of the environment or personal injuries caused by releases of hazardous substances.  Environmental laws are subject to frequent change and many of them have become more stringent. In some cases, they can impose liability for the entire cost of cleanup on any responsible party, without regard to negligence     26    Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements  or fault, and impose liability on us for the conduct of others or conditions others have caused, or for our acts that complied with all applicable requirements when we performed them.  Worldwide political and economic developments could damage our operations and materially reduce our profitability and cash flows.  Local political and economic factors in international markets could have a material adverse effect on us. A total of 59 percent of our liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas sales volumes in 2007 was derived from production outside the United States and 73 percent of our proved liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves as of December 31, 2007 were located outside the United States. All of our bitumen production and proved reserves are located in Canada.  There are many risks associated with operations in international markets, including changes in foreign governmental policies relating to liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas, bitumen or refined product pricing and taxation, other political, economic or diplomatic developments and international monetary fluctuations. These risks include:        •    political and economic instability, war, acts of terrorism and civil disturbances;        •    the possibility that a foreign government may seize our property with or without compensation, may attempt to renegotiate or revoke existing contractual arrangements or may impose additional taxes or royalty burdens; and        •    fluctuating currency values, hard currency shortages and currency controls.  Continued hostilities in the Middle East and the occurrence or threat of future terrorist attacks could adversely affect the economies of the United States and other developed countries. A lower level of economic activity could result in a decline in energy consumption, which could cause our revenues and margins to decline and limit our future growth prospects. These risks could lead to increased volatility in prices for liquid hydrocarbons, natural gas and refined products. In addition, these risks could increase instability in the financial and insurance markets and make it more difficult for us to access capital and to obtain the insurance coverage that we consider adequate.  Actions of governments through tax and other legislation, executive order and commercial restrictions could reduce our operating profitability both in the United States and abroad. The U.S. government can prevent or restrict us from doing business in foreign countries. These restrictions and those of foreign governments have in the past limited our ability to operate in, or gain access to, opportunities in various countries. Actions by both the United States and host governments have affected operations significantly in the past and will continue to do so in the future.   Our operations are subject to business interruptions and casualty losses, and we do not insure against all potential losses and, therefore, we could be seriously harmed by unexpected liabilities.  Our exploration and production operations are subject to unplanned occurrences, including blowouts, explosions, fires, loss of well control, spills, hurricanes and other adverse weather, labor disputes and accidents. Our oil sands mining operations are subject to business interruptions due to breakdown or failure of equipment or processes and unplanned events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions or other interruptions. In addition, our refining, marketing and transportation operations are subject to business interruptions due to scheduled refinery turnarounds and unplanned events such as explosions, fires, pipeline ruptures or other interruptions, crude oil or refined product spills, inclement weather and labor disputes. Our operations are also subject to the additional hazards of pollution, releases of toxic gas and other environmental hazards and risks, as well as hazards of marine operations, such as capsizing, collision and damage or loss from severe weather conditions. These hazards could result in loss of human life, significant damage to property and equipment, environmental pollution, impairment of operations and substantial losses to us. Certain hazards have adversely affected us in the past, and litigation arising from a catastrophic occurrence in the future involving us or any of our assets or operations may result in our being named as a defendant in one or more lawsuits asserting potentially large claims or being assessed potentially substantial fines by governmental authorities.  We maintain insurance against many, but not all, potential losses or liabilities arising from these operating hazards in amounts that we believe to be prudent. Uninsured losses and liabilities arising from operating hazards could reduce the funds available to us for capital, exploration and investment spending and could materially     27    Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements  reduce our profitability. Historically, we have maintained insurance coverage for physical damage and resulting business interruption to our major onshore and offshore facilities. Due to hurricane activity in recent years, the availability of insurance coverage for our offshore facilities for windstorms in the Gulf of Mexico region has been reduced or, in many instances, it is prohibitively expensive. As a result, our exposure to losses from future windstorm activity in the Gulf of Mexico region has increased.  We may not be successful in integrating and optimizing assets acquired in our acquisition of Western.  Risks associated with acquisitions include those relating to:        •    liability for known or unknown environmental conditions or other contingent liabilities not covered by indemnification or insurance;        •    greater than anticipated expenditures required for compliance with environmental or other regulatory standards, or for investments to improve operating results;        •    difficulties in achieving anticipated operational improvements;        •    diversion of management time and attention from our existing businesses and other priorities; and        •    difficulties in integrating the financial, technological and management standards, processes, procedures and controls of an acquired business into those of our existing operations.  Such acquisition risks are in addition to any risks inherent in the operations of an oil sands mining business.  If Ashland fails to pay its taxes, we could be responsible for satisfying various tax obligations of Ashland.  As a result of the transactions in which we acquired the minority interest in MPC from Ashland in 2005, Marathon is severally liable for federal income taxes (and in some cases for certain state taxes) of Ashland for tax years still open as of the date we completed the transactions. We have entered into a tax matters agreement with Ashland, which provides that:        •    we will be responsible for the tax liabilities of the Marathon group of companies, including the tax liabilities of MPC and the other companies and businesses we acquired in the transactions (for periods after the completion of the transactions); and        •    Ashland will generally be responsible for the tax liabilities of the Ashland group of companies before the completion of the transactions, and the income taxes attributable to Ashland’s interest in MPC before the completion of the transactions. However, under certain circumstances we will have several liability for those tax liabilities owed by Ashland to various taxing authorities, including the Internal Revenue Service.  If Ashland fails to pay any tax obligation for which we are severally liable, we may be required to satisfy this tax obligation. That would leave us in the position of having to seek indemnification from Ashland. In that event, our indemnification claims against Ashland would constitute general unsecured claims, which would be effectively subordinate to the claims of secured creditors of Ashland, and we would be subject to collection risk associated with collecting unsecured debt from Ashland.  Marathon is required to pay Ashland for deductions relating to various contingent liabilities of Ashland, which could be material.  We are required to claim tax deductions for certain contingent liabilities that will be paid by Ashland after completion of the transactions. Under the tax matters agreement, we are required to pay the benefit of those deductions to Ashland, with the computation and payment terms for such tax benefit payments divided into two “baskets,” as described below:    28    Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Basket One – This applies to the first $30 million of contingent liability deductions (increased by inflation each year up to a maximum of $60 million) that we may claim in each year for the first 20 years following the acquisition. The benefit of Basket One deductions is determined by multiplying the amount of the deduction by 32% (or, if different, by a percentage equal to three percentage points less than the highest federal income tax rate during the applicable tax year). We are obligated to pay this amount to Ashland. The computation and payment of Basket One amounts does not depend on our ability to generate actual tax savings from the use of the contingent liability deductions in Basket One. Upon specified events related to Ashland (or after 20 years), the contingent liability deductions that would otherwise have been compensated under Basket One will be taken into account in Basket Two. In addition, Basket One applies only for federal income tax purposes; state, local or foreign tax benefits attributable to specified liability deductions will be compensated only under Basket Two.  Because we are required to make payments to Ashland whether or not we generate any actual tax savings from the Basket One contingent liability deductions, the amount of our tax benefit payments to Ashland with respect to Basket One contingent liability deductions may exceed the aggregate tax benefits that we derive from these deductions. We are obligated to make these payments to Ashland even if we do not have sufficient taxable income to realize any benefit for the deductions.  Basket Two – All contingent liability deductions relating to Ashland’s pre-transactions operations that are not subject to Basket One are considered and compensated under Basket Two. The benefit of Basket Two deductions is determined on a “with and without” basis; that is, the contingent liability deductions are treated as the last deductions used by the Marathon group. Thus, if the Marathon group has deductions, tax credits or other tax benefits of its own, it will be deemed to use them to the maximum extent possible before it will be deemed to use the contingent liability deductions. To the extent that we have the capacity to use the contingent liability deductions based on this methodology, the actual amount of tax saved by the Marathon group through the use of the contingent liability deductions will be calculated and paid to Ashland. Because Basket Two amounts are calculated based on the actual tax saved by the Marathon group from the use of Basket Two deductions, those amounts are subject to recalculation in the event there is a change in the Marathon group’s tax liability for a particular year. This could occur because of audit adjustments or carrybacks of losses or credits from other years, for example. To the extent that such a recalculation results in a smaller Basket Two benefit with respect to a contingent liability deduction for which Ashland has already received compensation, Ashland is required to repay such compensation to Marathon. In the event we become entitled to any repayment, we would be subject to collection risks associated with collecting an unsecured claim from Ashland.  If the transactions resulting in our acquisition of the minority interest in MPC that was previously owned by Ashland were found to constitute a fraudulent transfer or conveyance, we could be required to provide additional consideration to Ashland or to return a portion of the interest in MPC, and either of those results could have a material adverse effect on us.  In a bankruptcy case or lawsuit initiated by one or more creditors or a representative of creditors of Ashland, a court may review our 2005 transactions with Ashland under state fraudulent transfer or conveyance laws. Under those laws, the transactions would be deemed fraudulent if the court determined that the transactions were undertaken for the purpose of hindering, delaying or defrauding creditors or that the transactions were constructively fraudulent. If the transactions were found to be a fraudulent transfer or conveyance, we might be required to provide additional consideration to Ashland or to return all or a portion of the interest in MPC and the other assets we acquired from Ashland.  Under the laws of most states, a transaction could be held to be constructively fraudulent if a court determined that:        •    the transferor received less than “reasonably equivalent value” or, in some jurisdictions, less than “fair consideration” or “valuable consideration;” and        •    the transferor:        •    was insolvent at the time of the transfer or was rendered insolvent by the transfer;        •    was engaged, or was about to engage, in a business or transaction for which its remaining property constituted unreasonably small capital; or        •    intended to incur, or believed it would incur, debts beyond its ability to pay as those debts matured.    29    Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements In connection with our transactions with Ashland completed in 2005, we delivered part of the overall consideration (specifically, shares of our common stock having a value of $915 million) to Ashland’s shareholders. In order to help establish that Ashland received reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration from us in the transactions, we obtained a written opinion from a nationally recognized appraisal firm to the effect that Ashland received amounts that were reasonably equivalent to the combined value of Ashland’s interest in MPC and the other assets we acquired. We also obtained a favorable opinion from that appraisal firm relating to various financial tests that supported our conclusion and Ashland’s representation to us that Ashland was not insolvent either before or after giving effect to the closing of the transactions. Those opinions were based on specific information provided to the appraisal firm and were subject to various assumptions, including assumptions relating to Ashland’s existing and contingent liabilities and insurance coverages. Although we are confident in our conclusions regarding (1) Ashland’s receipt of reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration and (2) Ashland’s solvency, it should be noted that the valuation of any business and a determination of the solvency of any entity involve numerous assumptions and uncertainties, and it is possible that a court could disagree with our conclusions.  If United States Steel fails to perform any of its material obligations to which we have financial exposure, we could be required to pay those obligations, and any such payment could materially reduce our cash flows and profitability and impair our financial condition.  In connection with the separation of United States Steel from Marathon, United States Steel agreed to hold Marathon harmless from and against various liabilities. While we cannot estimate some of these liabilities, the portion of these liabilities that we can estimate amounts to $533 million as of December 31, 2007, including accrued interest of $8 million. If United States Steel fails to satisfy any of those obligations, we would be required to satisfy them and seek indemnification from United States Steel. In that event, our indemnification claims against United States Steel would constitute general unsecured claims, effectively subordinate to the claims of secured creditors of United States Steel.  The steel business is highly competitive and a large number of industry participants have sought protection under bankruptcy laws in the past. The enforceability of our claims against United States Steel could become subject to the effect of any bankruptcy, fraudulent conveyance or transfer or other law affecting creditors’ rights generally, or of general principles of equity, which might become applicable to those claims or other claims arising from the facts and circumstances in which the separation was effected.  We may issue preferred stock whose terms could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of our common stock.  Our restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such preferences, powers and relative, participating, optional and other rights, including preferences over our common stock respecting dividends and distributions, as our Board of Directors generally may determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of our common stock. For example, we could grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the common stock.       Item 1B.
