Business GeneralMarathon Oil Corporation (NYSE: MRO) is an independent exploration and production company based in Houston, Texas, focused on U.S. unconventional resource plays with operations in North America, Europe and Africa. Our corporate headquarters is located at 5555 San Felipe Street, Houston, Texas 77056-2723 and our telephone number is (713) 629-6600. Each of our three reportable operating segments is organized and managed based upon both geographic location and the nature of the products and services it offers. The three segments are:•North America E&P – explores for, produces and markets crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas in North America;•International E&P – explores for, produces and markets crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas outside of North America and produces and markets products manufactured from natural gas, such as LNG and methanol, in E.G.; and•Oil Sands Mining – mines, extracts and transports bitumen from oil sands deposits in Alberta, Canada, and upgrades the bitumen to produce and market synthetic crude oil and vacuum gas oil. We were incorporated in 2001.See Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, for a more detailed discussion of our operating results, cash flows and outlook, including our 2017 Capital Program.The map below shows the locations of our worldwide operations.5Segment and Geographic InformationFor reportable operating segment and geographic financial information, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements.In the following discussion regarding our North America E&P, International E&P and Oil Sands Mining segments, references to net wells, acres, sales or investment indicate our ownership interest or share, as the context requires.North America E&P SegmentWe are engaged in oil and gas exploration, development and production activities in the U.S. Our primary focus in the North America E&P segment is concentrated within our three quality unconventional resource plays. North America E&P-- Unconventional Resource Plays Oklahoma Resource Basins – We hold approximately 365,000 net surface acres and includes 61,000 net acres added in the PayRock acquisition in the STACK Meramec play during 2016. In the SCOOP and STACK areas we hold net acres with rights to the Woodford, Springer, Meramec, Osage, Oswego, Granite Wash and other Pennsylvanian and Mississippian plays. Our primary 2017 focus will be in the Meramec play in the STACK and the Woodford and Springer plays in the SCOOP. Eagle Ford - We hold approximately 145,000 net acres in south Texas where we have been operating since 2011. We operate more than 1,365 gross (962 net) producing wells, 32 central gathering and treating facilities and approximately 865 miles of gathering pipeline in the Eagle Ford. We also own and operate the Sugarloaf gathering system, a 42-mile natural gas pipeline through the heart of our acreage in Karnes, Atascosa and Bee Counties of south Texas.Approximately 95% of the crude oil and condensate production is transported by pipeline with connections to multiple sales points. The ability to transport more barrels by pipeline enables us to improve/optimize price realizations, reduce costs, improve reliability and lessen our environmental footprint.Bakken – We hold approximately 270,000 net acres in North Dakota and eastern Montana, where we have been operating since 2006. Our large scale water gathering system is handling nearly 70% of our produced water. We are currently transporting about 75% of our oil production on pipeline. In an effort to optimize price realizations, we sell our production in local North Dakota markets and to select purchasers who may elect to transport outside of the state. Other North America Our remaining properties in North America primarily consist of a number of outside operated assets in the Gulf of Mexico, the largest of which is the Gunflint field located on Mississippi Canyon Blocks 948, 949, 992 (N/2) and 993 (N/2). The Gunflint field, in which we hold an 18% non-operated working interest, achieved first oil in the third quarter of 2016. In 2016, we continued our progress on portfolio management, with approximately $1.3 billion of non-core assets sales, which mainly included Wyoming and West Texas properties. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for information about these dispositions.International E&P Segment We are engaged in a range of activities, including oil and gas exploration, development and production across our international locations in E.G., Gabon, the Kurdistan Region of Iraq, Libya and the U.K. We include the results of our natural gas liquefaction operations and methanol production operations in E.G. in our International E&P segment. AfricaEquatorial Guinea – Production – We own a 63% operated working interest under a PSC in the Alba field which is offshore E.G. Operational availability from our company-operated facilities averaged approximately 97% in 2016. Equatorial Guinea – Gas Processing – We own a 52% interest in Alba Plant LLC, an equity method investee, which operates an onshore LPG processing plant located on Bioko Island. Alba field natural gas, under a long-term contract at a fixed price per btu, is processed by the LPG plant. The LPG plant extracts secondary condensate and LPG from the natural gas stream and uses some of the remaining dry natural gas in its operations. We also own 60% of EGHoldings and 45% of AMPCO, both of which are accounted for as equity method investments. EGHoldings operates a 3.7 mmta LNG production facility and AMPCO operates a methanol plant, both located on Bioko Island. These facilities allow us to further monetize natural gas production from the Alba field. AMPCO had gross sales totaling 1,100 mt in 2016. Methanol production is sold to customers in Europe and the U.S. The LNG production facility sells LNG under a 3.4 mmta, or 460 mmcfd, sales and purchase agreement. Under the agreement, which runs through 2023, the purchaser takes delivery of the LNG on Bioko Island, with pricing linked principally to the Henry Hub index. Gross sales of LNG from this production facility totaled 3.6 mmta in 2016. 6Libya – We hold a 16% non-operated working interest in the Waha concessions, which encompass almost 13 million gross acres located in the Sirte Basin of eastern Libya. Civil and political unrest has interrupted our production operations in recent years. During 2016, Force Majeure was lifted in September, production commenced shortly thereafter and liftings resumed in December. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about our Libya operations.Other International United Kingdom – Our operated asset in the U.K. sector of the North Sea is the Brae area complex where we are the operator and have a 42% working interest in the South, Central, North and West Brae fields, a 39% working interest in the East Brae field, and a 28% working interest in the nearby Braemar field. The strategic location of the Brae platforms, along with pipeline and onshore infrastructure, has generated third-party processing and transportation business since 1986. Currently, the operators of 31 third-party fields are contracted to use the Brae system and 72 mboed are being processed or transported through the Brae infrastructure. In addition to generating processing and pipeline tariff revenue, this third-party business optimizes infrastructure usage.The working interest owners of the Brae area producing assets collectively own a 50% non-operated interest in the SAGE pipeline system, which has a total wet natural gas capacity of 1.1 bcf per day. The SAGE terminal at St. Fergus in northeast Scotland processes natural gas from the SAGE pipeline as well as approximately 0.3 bcf per day of third-party natural gas.We own non-operated working interests in the Foinaven area complex, consisting of a 28% working interest in the main Foinaven field, a 47% working interest in East Foinaven and a 20% working interest in the T35 and T25 fields. The export of Foinaven liquid hydrocarbons is via shuttle tanker from an FPSO to market. All natural gas sales are to the non-operated Magnus platform for use as injection gas. Kurdistan Region of Iraq – In 2016, we relinquished to the Kurdistan Regional Government our 45% operated working interest in the Harir block located northeast of Erbil. We have non-operated interests in two blocks located north-northwest of Erbil: Atrush with a 15% working interest and Sarsang with a 20% working interest. International E&P ExplorationEquatorial Guinea – Exploration – We hold a 63% operated working interest in the Deep Luba discovery on the Alba Block and an 80% operated working interest in the Corona well on Block D. We plan to develop Block D through unitization with the Alba field. Negotiations have been substantially completed and we are awaiting approval from the host government.Gabon – Exploration – We hold a 21.25% non-operated working interest in the Diaba License G4-223 and its related permit offshore Gabon, and a 100% participating interest and operatorship in the Tchicuate block where we have an exploration and production sharing agreement.In 2015, we entered into agreements to sell our East Africa exploration acreage in Ethiopia and Kenya. This transaction closed during the first quarter of 2016. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for information about these dispositions.Oil Sands Mining SegmentWe hold a 20% non-operated interest in the AOSP, an oil sands mining and upgrading joint venture located in Alberta, Canada. Other JV partners include Shell Canada Limited with a 60% ownership interest and Chevron Canada Limited with a 20% ownership interest. Shell Canada Limited operates the joint venture, which produces bitumen from oil sands deposits in the Athabasca region utilizing mining techniques and upgrades the bitumen into synthetic crude oils. The AOSP’s mining and extraction assets are located near Fort McMurray, Alberta, and include the Muskeg River and the Jackpine mines. Gross design capacity of the combined mines is 255,000 (51,000 net) barrels of bitumen per day. As of December 31, 2016, we own or have rights to participate in developed and undeveloped surface mineable leases totaling approximately 155,000 gross (31,000 net) acres. The underlying developed leases are held for the duration of the project, with royalties payable to the province of Alberta. ReservesProved reserves are disclosed by continent and by country if the proved reserves related to any geographic area, on an oil equivalent barrel basis, represent 15% or more of our total proved reserves. A geographic area can be an individual country, group of countries within a continent or a continent. Other International ("Other Int’l"), includes the U.K. and the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. Approximately 79% of our proved reserves are located in OECD countries.7The following tables set forth estimated quantities of our total proved crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserves based upon an SEC pricing for period ended December 31, 2016.

Combined, total estimated proved reserves are 2,096 mmboe, of which liquids represents 81 percent. As of December 31, 2016, we had estimated proved developed reserves totaled 1,544 mmboe or 74% and estimated proved undeveloped reserves totaling 552 mmboe or 26% of our total proved reserves. For additional detail on reserves, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Supplementary Information on Oil and gas Producing Activities. Preparation of Reserve EstimatesAll estimates of reserves are made in compliance with SEC Rule 4-10 of Regulation S-X. Crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserve estimates are reviewed and approved by our Corporate Reserves Group ("CRG"), which includes our Director of Corporate Reserves and his staff of Reserve Coordinators. Crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserve estimates are developed or reviewed by Qualified Reserves Estimators ("QREs"). QREs are petro-technical professionals located throughout our organization who meet the qualifications we have established for employees engaged in estimating reserves and resources. QREs have the education, experience, and training necessary to estimate reserves and resources in a manner consistent with all external reserve estimation regulations and internal resource estimation directives and practices. QREs generally hold at least a Bachelor of Science degree in the appropriate technical field, have a minimum of three years of industry experience with at least one year in reserve estimation and have completed our QRE training course. All reserves changes (including proved) must be approved by the CRG. Additionally, any change to proved reserve estimates in excess of 5 mmboe on a total field basis, within a single month, must be approved by the Director of Corporate Reserves.The Director of Corporate Reserves, who reports to our Chief Financial Officer, has a Bachelor of Science degree in petroleum engineering and is a registered Professional Engineer in the State of New Mexico. In his 30 years with Marathon Oil, he has held numerous engineering and management positions, including more recently managing reservoir engineering and geoscience for our Eagle Ford development in South Texas. He is a 25 year member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers ("SPE"). Technologies used in proved reserves estimation includes statistical analysis of production performance, decline curve analysis, pressure and rate transient analysis, pressure gradient analysis, reservoir simulation and volumetric analysis. The 8observed statistical nature of production performance coupled with highly certain reservoir continuity or quality within the reliable technology areas and sufficient proved developed locations establish the reasonable certainty criteria required for booking proved reserves.Estimates of synthetic crude oil reserves were prepared by GLJ Petroleum Consultants of Calgary, Alberta, Canada, third-party consultants during 2015 and 2014. Their reports for all years are filed as exhibits to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The individual responsible, during 2015 and 2014, for the estimates of our synthetic crude oil reserves had 15 years of experience in petroleum engineering, has conducted surface mineable oil sands evaluations since 2009 and is a registered Practicing Professional Engineer in the Province of Alberta.Audits of EstimatesWe engage third-party consultants to provide, at a minimum, independent estimates for fields that comprise 80% of our total proved reserves over a rolling four-year period. We exceeded this percentage for the four-year period ended December 31, 2016, with 84% of our total proved reserves independently audited. An audit tolerance at a field level of +/- 10%, to our internal estimates, has been established. Should the third-party consultants’ initial analysis fall outside our tolerance band, both parties will re-examine the information provided, request additional data and refine their analysis, if appropriate. In the very limited instances where differences outside the 10% tolerance cannot be resolved by year end, a plan to resolve the difference is developed and executive management consent is obtained. The audit process did not result in any significant changes to our reserve estimates for 2016, 2015 or 2014. During 2016, 2015 and 2014, Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc. prepared a reserves certification for the last three reporting periods for the Alba field in E.G. The NSAI summary reports are filed as an exhibit to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Members of the NSAI team have multiple years of industry experience, having worked for large, international oil and gas companies before joining NSAI. NSAI’s technical team members meet or exceed the education, training, and experience requirements set forth in the Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Engineers. The senior technical advisor has over 12 years of practical experience in petroleum engineering and the estimation and evaluation of reserves and is a registered Professional Engineer in the State of Texas. The second team member has over 10 years of practical experience in petroleum geosciences and is a licensed Professional Geoscientist in the State of Texas.Ryder Scott Company also performed audits of the prior years' reserves of several of our fields in 2016, 2015 and 2014. Their summary reports are filed as exhibits to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The team lead for Ryder Scott has over 34 years of industry experience, having worked for a major financial advisory services group before joining Ryder Scott. He is a 25 year member of SPE and is a registered Professional Engineer in the State of Texas.9Productive and Drilling WellsFor our North America E&P and International E&P segments, the following table sets forth gross and net productive wells, service wells and drilling wells as of December 31 for the years presented.

These activities include the transportation of production to market centers, the sale of commodities to third parties and the storage of production. We balance our various sales, storage and transportation positions in order to aggregate volumes to satisfy transportation commitments and to achieve flexibility within product types and delivery points. Such activities can include the purchase of commodities from third parties for resale.Delivery CommitmentsWe have committed to deliver quantities of crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and synthetic crude oil to customers under a variety of contracts. As of December 31, 2016, the contracts for fixed and determinable quantities were at variable, market-based pricing and related primarily to the following sales commitments:  2017 2018 2019 Thereafter Commitment Period ThroughEagle Ford          Crude and condensate (mbbld) 105 80 66 51 2020Natural gas (mmcfd) 210 168 168 46 - 168 2022Bakken          Crude and condensate (mbbld) 5 10 10 5-10 2027OSM          Synthetic crude oil (mbbld) 10 — — —  All of these contracts provide the options of delivering third-party volumes or paying a monetary shortfall penalty if production is inadequate. Certain volumetric requirements can also be met through purchases of third-party volumes. In addition to the sales contracts discussed above, we have entered into numerous agreements for transportation and processing of our equity production. Some of these contracts have volumetric requirements which could require monetary shortfall penalties if our production is inadequate to meet the terms.13Competition Competition exists in all sectors of the oil and gas industry and, in particular, in the exploration for and development of new reserves. We compete with major integrated and independent oil and gas companies, as well as national oil companies, for the acquisition of oil and natural gas leases and other properties. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for discussion of specific areas in which we compete and related risks.We also compete with other producers of synthetic crude oil for the sale of our synthetic crude oil to refineries primarily in North America. Because not all refineries are able to process or refine synthetic crude oil in significant volumes, sufficient market demand may not exist at all times to absorb our share of the synthetic crude oil production from the AOSP at economically viable prices. Environmental, Health and Safety MattersThe Health, Environmental, Safety and Corporate Responsibility Committee of our Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing our position on public issues, including environmental, health and safety matters. Our Corporate Health, Environment, Safety and Security organization has the responsibility to ensure that our operating organizations maintain environmental compliance systems that support and foster our compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Committees comprised of certain of our officers review our overall performance associated with various environmental compliance programs. We also have a Corporate Emergency Response Team which oversees our response to any major environmental or other emergency incident involving us or any of our properties. Our businesses are subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, health and safety at the national, state and local levels. These laws and their implementing regulations and other similar state and local laws and rules can impose certain operational controls for minimization of pollution, recordkeeping, monitoring and reporting requirements or other operational or siting constraints on our business, result in costs to remediate releases of regulated substances, including crude oil, into the environment, or require costs to remediate sites to which we sent regulated substances for disposal. In some cases, these laws can impose strict liability for the entire cost of clean-up on any responsible party without regard to negligence or fault and impose liability on us for the conduct of others (such as prior owners or operators of our assets) or conditions others have caused, or for our acts that complied with all applicable requirements when we performed them. We have incurred and will continue to incur capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations. New laws have been enacted and regulations are being adopted by various regulatory agencies on a continuing basis and the costs of compliance with these new laws and regulations can only be broadly appraised until their implementation becomes more defined.For a discussion of environmental capital expenditures and costs of compliance for air, water, solid waste and remediation, see Item 3. Legal Proceedings and Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Environmental Matters, Litigation and Contingencies.Air and Climate ChangeThe EPA finalized a more stringent National Ambient Air Quality Standard ("NAAQS") for ozone in October 2015. This more stringent ozone NAAQS could result in additional areas being designated as non-attainment, including areas in which we operate, which may result in an increase in costs for emission controls and requirements for additional monitoring and testing, as well as a more cumbersome permitting process. Although there may be an adverse financial impact (including compliance costs, potential permitting delays and increased regulatory requirements) associated with this revised regulation, the extent and magnitude of that impact cannot be reliably or accurately estimated due to the present uncertainty regarding any additional measures and how they will be implemented. The EPA's final rule has been judicially challenged by both industry and other interested parties, and the outcome of this litigation may also impact implementation and revisions to the rule.In June 2016, the EPA published a suite of final rules specifically targeting methane emissions from the oil and gas industry, aggregation of air emissions sources and minor source permitting for operations on tribal lands. The EPA has also announced that it intends to impose methane emission standards for existing sources and has issued information collection requests for oil and natural gas facilities. We are currently evaluating the impact of these rules on our operations. If we are unable to comply with the terms of these regulations, we could be required to forego construction or implement modifications to certain operations. These regulations may also increase compliance costs for some facilities we own or operate, and result in administrative, civil and/or criminal penalties for non-compliance.14In 2010, the EPA promulgated rules that require us to monitor and submit an annual report on our greenhouse gas emissions. In October 2015, the EPA finalized rules that added new sources to the scope of the greenhouse gas monitoring and reporting requirements. These new sources include gathering and boosting facilities as well as completions and workovers from hydraulically fractured oil wells. The revisions also include the addition of well identification reporting requirements for certain facilities. Further, state, national and international requirements to reduce greenhouse emissions are being proposed and in some cases promulgated (see discussion above regarding regulation of methane emissions from the oil and gas industry by the EPA). Potential legislation and regulations pertaining to climate change could also affect our operations. The cost to comply with these laws and regulations cannot be estimated at this time. In November 2016, the Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”) issued a final rule to further restrict venting and/or flaring of gas from facilities subject to BLM jurisdiction, and to modify certain royalty requirements. These regulations are currently subject to a challenge under the Congressional Review Act, which if successful, would result in complete withdrawal of these requirements. If not withdrawn, this rule is expected to result in additional costs of compliance as well as increased monitoring, recordkeeping and recording for some of our facilities. If we are unable to comply with the terms of these regulations, we could be required to forego certain operations. These regulations may also result in administrative, civil and/or criminal penalties for non-compliance.For additional information, see Item 1A. Risk Factors. As part of our commitment to environmental stewardship, we estimate and publicly report greenhouse gas emissions from our operations. We are working to continuously improve the accuracy and completeness of these estimates. In addition, we continuously strive to improve operational and energy efficiencies through resource and energy conservation where practicable and cost effective.Hydraulic FracturingHydraulic fracturing is a commonly used process that involves injecting water, sand and small volumes of chemicals into the wellbore to fracture the hydrocarbon-bearing rock thousands of feet below the surface to facilitate higher flow of hydrocarbons into the wellbore. Our business uses this technique extensively throughout our operations. Hydraulic fracturing has been regulated at the state and local level through permitting and compliance requirements. Federal, state and local-level laws or regulations targeting various aspects of the hydraulic fracturing process are being considered, or have been proposed or implemented. For example, the U.S. Congress has considered legislation that would require additional regulation affecting the hydraulic fracturing process, and may be expected to do so in future legislative sessions. Further, various state and local-level initiatives in regions with substantial shale resources have been or may be proposed or implemented to further regulate hydraulic fracturing practices, limit water withdrawals and water use, require disclosure of fracturing fluid constituents, restrict which additives may be used, or implement temporary or permanent bans on hydraulic fracturing. For additional information, see Item 1A. Risk Factors.TransportationA number of state and federal rules apply to the transportation of liquid hydrocarbons. In 2015, the U.S. Department of Transportation (“DOT”) finalized a rule relating to testing and classification of liquid hydrocarbons and imposing additional restrictions on the types of rail cars that may be used in certain types of liquid hydrocarbon service. Similarly, in August 2016, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (“PHMSA”), a sub-agency of DOT, published a final rule setting additional safety requirements and retrofits for rail cars. PHMSA is also considering revising its regulations to require particular methods for conducting vapor pressure testing and sampling of unrefined petroleum-based products for transportation. Although our businesses do not own rail cars and purchasers of our liquid hydrocarbons make arrangements for its transportation, such regulations could increase transportation costs which are passed on to Marathon Oil by liquid hydrocarbon purchasers. In addition, PHMSA has proposed or announced the intention to propose various rules related to pipeline transportation of natural gas and/or liquid hydrocarbons. For example, in October 2015, PHMSA published a notice of proposed rulemaking amending its hazardous liquid pipeline safety regulations and in April 2016, published a notice of proposed rulemaking addressing natural gas transmission and gathering lines. Such regulations could increase the regulatory burden on our businesses where we own or operate pipelines or could otherwise increase costs to third parties that are passed on to Marathon Oil.WaterIn 2014, the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers published proposed regulations which expand the surface waters that are regulated under the Clean Water Act and its various programs. While these regulations were finalized largely as proposed in 2015, the rule has been stayed by the courts pending a substantive decision on the merits. If this rule is ultimately implemented, the expansion of CWA jurisdiction will result in additional costs of compliance as well as increased monitoring, recordkeeping and recording for some of our facilities.15Concentrations of Credit RiskWe are exposed to credit risk in the event of nonpayment by counterparties, a significant portion of which are concentrated in energy-related industries. The creditworthiness of customers and other counterparties is subject to continuing review, including the use of master netting agreements, where appropriate. In 2016, sales to Irving Oil and Valero Marketing and Supply and each of their respective affiliates accounted for approximately 17% and 10% of our total revenues. In 2015, sales to Irving Oil and Shell Oil and each of their respective affiliates accounted for approximately 13% and 11% of our total revenues. In 2014, sales to Shell Oil and its affiliates accounted for approximately 10% of our total revenues.Trademarks, Patents and LicensesWe currently hold a number of U.S. and foreign patents and have various pending patent applications. Although in the aggregate our trademarks, patents and licenses are important to us, we do not regard any single trademark, patent, license or group of related trademarks, patents or licenses as critical or essential to our business as a whole.EmployeesWe had 2,117 active, full-time employees as of December 31, 2016.

Risk FactorsWe are subject to various risks and uncertainties in the course of our business. The following summarizes significant risks and uncertainties that may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. When considering an investment in our securities, you should carefully consider the risk factors included below as well as those matters referenced in the foregoing pages under "Disclosures Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" and other information included and incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K.The substantial decline in crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and synthetic crude oil prices since 2014 has reduced our operating results and cash flows and, regardless of the recent increase in prices, could still adversely impact our future rate of growth and the carrying value of our assets.Prices for crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and synthetic crude oil fluctuate widely. Our revenues, operating results and future rate of growth are highly dependent on the prices we receive for our crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and synthetic crude oil. Historically, the markets for crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and synthetic crude oil have been volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future. Although, prices for WTI and Brent crude oil, Henry Hub natural gas and natural gas liquids have increased in the last several months, prices are still significantly below their highs from 2014. Many of the factors influencing prices of crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and synthetic crude oil are beyond our control. These factors include:•worldwide and domestic supplies of and demand for crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and synthetic crude oil;•the cost of exploring for, developing and producing crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and synthetic crude oil;•the ability of the members of OPEC and certain non-OPEC members, such as Russia, to agree to and maintain production controls;•the production levels of non-OPEC countries, including production levels in the shale plays in the United States;•the level of drilling, completion and production activities by other exploration and production companies, and variability therein, in response to market conditions;•political instability or armed conflict in oil and natural gas producing regions;•changes in weather patterns and climate;•natural disasters such as hurricanes and tornadoes;•the price and availability of alternative and competing forms of energy;•the effect of conservation efforts;•epidemics or pandemics;•technological advances affecting energy consumption and energy supply;•domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes; and•general economic conditions worldwide.The long-term effects of these and other factors on the prices of crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and synthetic crude oil are uncertain. Historical declines in commodity prices have adversely affected our business by:•reducing the amount of crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and synthetic crude oil that we can produce economically;•reducing our revenues, operating income and cash flows;•causing us to reduce our capital expenditures, and delay or postpone some of our capital projects; •requiring us to impair the carrying value of our assets; •reducing the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and synthetic crude oil; and•increasing the costs of obtaining capital, such as equity and short- and long-term debt.Future decreases in prices could have similar adverse effects on our business.18If crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and synthetic crude oil prices remain substantially below their 2014 highs or fall below current levels, it could adversely affect the abilities of our counterparties to perform their obligations to us, including abandonment obligations, which could negatively impact our financial results. We often enter into arrangements to conduct certain business operations, such as oil and gas exploration and production, oil sands mining or transportation of crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and synthetic crude oil, with partners and other counterparties in order to share risks associated with those operations. In addition, we market our products to a variety of purchasers. If commodity prices remain at or fall below current levels, some of our counterparties may experience liquidity problems and may not be able to meet their financial and other obligations, including abandonment obligations, to us. The inability of our joint venture partners to fund their portion of the costs under our joint venture agreements, or the nonperformance by purchasers, contractors or other counterparties of their obligations to us, could negatively impact our operating results and cash flows.Estimates of crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserves depend on many factors and assumptions, including various assumptions that are based on conditions in existence as of the dates of the estimates. Any material changes in those conditions or other factors affecting those assumptions could impair the quantity and value of our reserves.The proved reserve information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K has been derived from engineering and geoscience estimates. Estimates of crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserves were prepared, in accordance with SEC regulations, by our in-house teams of reservoir engineers and geoscience professionals and were reviewed and approved by our Corporate Reserves Group. Prior to 2016, the synthetic crude oil reserves estimates were prepared by GLJ, a third-party consulting firm experienced in working with oil sands. Reserves were valued based on SEC pricing for the periods ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, as well as other conditions in existence at those dates. The table below provides the 2016 SEC pricing for certain benchmark prices: SEC Pricing 2016WTI Crude oil (per bbl)$42.75Henry Hub natural gas (per mmbtu)$2.49Brent crude oil (per bbl)$43.53Mont Belvieu NGLs (per bbl)$15.89 If commodity prices were to significantly drop below average prices used to estimate 2016 proved reserves (see table above), we would expect price related reserve revisions that could have a material impact on proved reserve volumes and the present value of our proved reserves. In this scenario, our OSM proved reserves represent the largest risk to be reclassified to non-proved reserves or resource category. Future reserve revisions could also result from changes in capital funding, drilling plans and governmental regulation, among other things. Reserve estimation is a subjective process that involves estimating volumes to be recovered from underground accumulations of crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and bitumen that cannot be directly measured (bitumen is mined and then upgraded into synthetic crude oil.) Estimates of economically producible reserves and of future net cash flows depend on a number of variable factors and assumptions, including:•location, size and shape of the accumulation as well as fluid, rock and producing characteristics of the accumulation;•historical production from the area, compared with production from other analogous producing areas;•volumes of bitumen in-place and various factors affecting the recoverability of bitumen and its conversion into synthetic crude oil such as historical upgrader performance;•the assumed impacts of regulation by governmental agencies;•assumptions concerning future operating costs, taxes, development costs and workover and repair costs; and•industry economic conditions, levels of cash flows from operations and other operating considerations.As a result, different petroleum engineers and geoscientists, each using industry-accepted geologic and engineering practices and scientific methods, may produce different estimates of proved reserves and future net cash flows based on the same available data. Because of the subjective nature of such reserve estimates, each of the following items may differ materially from the estimated amounts:•the amount and timing of production;19•the revenues and costs associated with that production; and•the amount and timing of future development expenditures.If we are unsuccessful in acquiring or finding additional reserves, our future crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and synthetic crude oil production would decline, thereby reducing our cash flows and results of operations and impairing our financial condition.The rate of production from crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and synthetic crude oil properties generally declines as reserves are depleted. Except to the extent we acquire interests in additional properties containing proved reserves, conduct successful exploration and development activities or, through engineering studies, optimize production performance or identify additional reservoirs not currently producing or secondary recovery reserves, our proved reserves will decline materially as crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and synthetic crude oil are produced. Accordingly, to the extent we are not successful in replacing the crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and synthetic crude oil we produce, our future revenues will decline. Creating and maintaining an inventory of prospects for future production depends on many factors, including:•obtaining rights to explore for, develop and produce crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and synthetic crude oil in promising areas;•drilling success;•the ability to complete long lead-time, capital-intensive projects timely and cost effectively;•the ability to find or acquire additional proved reserves at acceptable costs; and•the ability to fund such activity.Future exploration and drilling results are uncertain and involve substantial costs.Drilling for crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas involves numerous risks, including the risk that we may not encounter commercially productive reservoirs. The costs of drilling, completing and operating wells are often uncertain, and drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors, including:•unexpected drilling conditions;•title problems;•pressure or irregularities in formations;•equipment failures or accidents;•inflation in exploration and drilling costs;•fires, explosions, blowouts or surface cratering;•lack of access to pipelines or other transportation methods; and•shortages or delays in the availability of services or delivery of equipment.If we are unable to complete capital projects at their expected costs and in a timely manner, or if the market conditions assumed in our project economics deteriorate, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.Delays or cost increases related to capital spending programs involving engineering, procurement and construction of facilities (including improvements and repairs to our existing facilities) could adversely affect our ability to achieve forecasted internal rates of return and operating results. Delays in making required changes or upgrades to our facilities could subject us to fines or penalties as well as affect our ability to supply certain products we produce. Such delays or cost increases may arise as a result of unpredictable factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:•denial of or delay in receiving requisite regulatory approvals and/or permits;•unplanned increases in the cost of construction materials or labor;•disruptions in transportation of components or construction materials;•increased costs or operational delays resulting from shortages of water; •adverse weather conditions, natural disasters or other events (such as equipment malfunctions, explosions, fires or spills) affecting our facilities, or those of vendors or suppliers;20•shortages of sufficiently skilled labor, or labor disagreements resulting in unplanned work stoppages;•market-related increases in a project’s debt or equity financing costs; and•nonperformance by, or disputes with, vendors, suppliers, contractors or subcontractors.Any one or more of these factors could have a significant impact on our capital projects.Our offshore operations involve special risks that could negatively impact us.Offshore exploration and development operations present technological challenges and operating risks because of the marine environment. Activities in deepwater areas may pose incrementally greater risks because of water depths that limit intervention capability and the physical distance to oilfield service infrastructure and service providers. Environmental remediation and other costs resulting from spills or releases may result in substantial liabilities.We may incur substantial capital expenditures and operating costs as a result of compliance with, and/or changes in environmental, health, safety and security laws and regulations, and, as a result, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.Our businesses are subject to numerous laws, regulations and other requirements relating to the protection of the environment, including those relating to the discharge of materials into the environment such as the venting or flaring of natural gas, waste management, pollution prevention, greenhouse gas emissions and the protection of endangered species as well as laws, regulations, and other requirements relating to public and employee safety and health and to facility security. We have incurred and may continue to incur capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures as a result of these laws, regulations, and other requirements. To the extent these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products, our operating results will be adversely affected. The specific impact of these laws, regulations, and other requirements may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of operating facilities and production processes. We may also be required to make material expenditures to modify operations, install pollution control equipment, perform site clean-ups or curtail operations that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We may become subject to liabilities that we currently do not anticipate in connection with new, amended or more stringent requirements, stricter interpretations of existing requirements or the future discovery of contamination. In addition, any failure by us to comply with existing or future laws, regulations, and other requirements could result in civil penalties or criminal fines and other enforcement actions against us. We believe it is likely that the scientific and political attention to issues concerning the extent, causes of and responsibility for climate change will continue, with the potential for further regulations that could affect our operations. Our operations result in greenhouse gas emissions. Currently, various legislative or regulatory measures to address greenhouse gas emissions (including carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxides) are in various phases of review, discussion or implementation in countries where we operate, including the U.S., Canada, and the European Union. Internationally, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change finalized an agreement among 195 nations at the 21st Conference of the Parties in Paris with an overarching goal of preventing global temperatures from rising more than 2 degrees Celsius. The agreement includes provisions that every country take some action to lower emissions, but there is no legal requirement for how or by what amount emissions should be lowered. The EPA has also finalized regulations targeting new sources of methane emissions from the oil and gas industry, and has issued requests for information on existing sources. Finalization of new legislation, regulations or international agreements in the future could result in increased costs to operate and maintain our facilities, capital expenditures to install new emission controls at our facilities, and costs to administer and manage any potential greenhouse gas emissions or carbon trading or tax programs. These costs and capital expenditures could be material. Although uncertain, these developments could increase our costs, reduce the demand for crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and synthetic crude oil, and create delays in our obtaining air pollution permits for new or modified facilities. The potential adoption of federal, state and local legislative and regulatory initiatives related to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased compliance costs, operating restrictions or delays in the completion of oil and gas wells. Hydraulic fracturing is a commonly used process that involves injecting water, sand, and small volumes of chemicals into the wellbore to fracture the hydrocarbon-bearing rock thousands of feet below the surface to facilitate higher flow of hydrocarbons into the wellbore. Our business uses this technique extensively throughout our U.S. operations. Hydraulic fracturing has been regulated at the state and local level through permitting and compliance requirements. Federal, state and local-level laws or regulations targeting various aspects of the hydraulic fracturing process are being considered, or have been proposed or implemented. For example, the U.S. Congress has considered legislation that would require additional regulation affecting the hydraulic fracturing process, and may be expected to do so in future legislative sessions. Further, various state and local-level initiatives in regions with substantial shale resources have been or may be proposed or implemented to further regulate hydraulic fracturing practices, limit water withdrawals and water use, require disclosure of fracturing fluid constituents, restrict which additives may be used, or implement temporary or permanent bans on hydraulic fracturing. In 2015 21the Bureau of Land Management issued a rule governing certain hydraulic fracturing practices on lands within their jurisdiction. While this rule has been stayed nationwide by court ruling, further findings by the court could result in additional changes to this new rule.Increased regulation and attention given to the hydraulic fracturing process could lead to greater opposition, including litigation, to oil and gas activities using hydraulic fracturing techniques. Additional legislation or regulation could also lead to operational delays or increased operating costs in the production of crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas, including from the shale plays, or could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing. The adoption of any federal, state or local laws or the implementation of regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing could potentially cause a decrease in the completion of new oil and gas wells and increased compliance costs which could increase costs of our operations and cause considerable delays in acquiring regulatory approvals to drill and complete wells.The potential adoption of federal, state and local legislative and regulatory initiatives intended to address potential induced seismic activity in the areas in which we operate could result in increased compliance costs, operating restrictions or delays in the completion of oil and gas wells. State and federal regulatory agencies recently have focused on a possible connection between the operation of injection wells used for oil and gas waste disposal and seismic activity. When caused by human activity, such events are called induced seismicity. Marathon does not currently own or operate water disposal wells in the current areas of interest but does contract for services that regularly inject produced water into underground injection wells. Separate and apart from the referenced potential connection between injection wells and seismicity, concerns have been raised that hydraulic fracturing activities may be correlated to anomalous seismic events. Marathon does use hydraulic fracturing techniques throughout its U.S. operations. While the scientific community and regulatory agencies at all levels are continuing to study the possible linkage between oil and gas activity and induced seismicity, some state regulatory agencies have modified their regulations or guidance to mitigate potential causes of induced seismicity. For example, Oklahoma has taken numerous regulatory actions in response to concerns related to the operation of produced water disposal wells and induced seismicity, and has issued guidelines to operators in certain areas of the State curtailing injection of produced water due to seismic concerns. Marathon does not currently own or operate injection wells in these areas. Further, Oklahoma recently issued guidelines to operators for management of anomalous seismicity that may be related to hydraulic fracturing activities in the SCOOP/STACK area. In addition, a number of lawsuits have been filed in Oklahoma alleging damage from seismicity relating to disposal well operations. Marathon has not been named in any of those lawsuits.Increased seismicity in Oklahoma or other areas could result in additional regulation and restrictions on our operations and could lead to operational delays or increased operating costs. Additional regulation and attention given to induced seismicity could also lead to greater opposition, including litigation, to oil and gas activities.Worldwide political and economic developments and changes in law could adversely affect our operations and materially reduce our profitability and cash flows.Local political and economic factors in global markets could have a material adverse effect on us. A total of 45% of our crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and synthetic crude oil volumes related to continuing operations in 2016 was derived from production outside the U.S. and 55% of our proved crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserves as of December 31, 2016 were located outside the U.S. All of our synthetic crude oil production and proved reserves are located in Canada. We are, therefore, subject to the political, geographic and economic risks and possible terrorist activities or other armed conflict attendant to doing business within or outside of the U.S. There are many risks associated with operations in countries such as E.G., Gabon, the Kurdistan Region of Iraq and Libya, and in global markets including: •changes in governmental policies relating to crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas or synthetic crude oil and taxation;•other political, economic or diplomatic developments and international monetary fluctuations;•political and economic instability, war, acts of terrorism, armed conflict and civil disturbances;•the possibility that a government may seize our property with or without compensation, may attempt to renegotiate or revoke existing contractual arrangements or may impose additional taxes or royalty burdens; and•fluctuating currency values, hard currency shortages and currency controls.22For the past several years, there have been varying degrees of political instability and public protests, including demonstrations which have been marked by violence and numerous incidences of terrorist acts, within some countries in the Middle East, including Bahrain, Egypt, Iraq, Libya, Syria, Tunisia and Yemen. Some political regimes in these countries are threatened or have changed as a result of such unrest. If such unrest continues to spread, conflicts could result in civil wars, regional conflicts, and regime changes resulting in governments that are hostile to the U.S. These may have the following results, among others:•volatility in global crude oil prices which could negatively impact the global economy, resulting in slower economic growth rates and reduced demand for our products;•negative impact on the world crude oil supply if transportation avenues are disrupted;•security concerns leading to the prolonged evacuation of our personnel;•damage to, or the inability to access, production facilities or other operating assets; and•inability of our service and equipment providers to deliver items necessary for us to conduct our operations.Continued hostilities in the Middle East and the occurrence or threat of future terrorist attacks, or other armed conflict, could adversely affect the economies of the U.S. and other developed countries. A lower level of economic activity could result in a decline in energy consumption, which could cause our revenues and margins to decline and limit our future growth prospects. These risks could lead to increased volatility in prices for crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and synthetic crude oil. In addition, these risks could increase instability in the financial and insurance markets and make it more difficult for us to access capital and to obtain the insurance coverage that we consider adequate.Actions of governments through tax legislation and other changes in law, executive order and commercial restrictions could reduce our operating profitability, both in the U.S. and abroad. The U.S. government can prevent or restrict us from doing business in foreign countries. These restrictions and those of foreign governments have in the past limited our ability to operate in, or gain access to, opportunities in various countries and will continue to do so in the future. Changes in law could also adversely affect our results, including new regulations resulting in higher costs to transport our production by pipeline, rail car, truck or vessel or the adoption of government payment transparency regulations that could require us to disclose competitively sensitive commercial information or that could cause us to violate the non-disclosure laws of other countries.Our level of indebtedness may limit our liquidity and financial flexibility. As of December 31, 2016, our total debt was $7.3 billion, of which $686 million is due within 12 months. Our indebtedness could have important consequences to our business, including, but not limited to, the following:•we may be more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions;•a portion of our cash flows from operating activities must be used to service our indebtedness and is not available for other purposes;•our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our industry may be limited;•a financial covenant in our Credit Agreement stipulates that our total debt to capitalization ratio will not exceed 65% as of the last day of any fiscal quarter, and if exceeded, may make additional borrowings more expensive and affect our ability to plan for and react to changes in the economy and our industry;•we may be at a competitive disadvantage as compared to similar companies that have less debt; and•additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or development activities, general corporate or other purposes may have higher costs and more restrictive covenants.We may incur additional debt in order to fund our capital expenditures, acquisitions or development activities, or for general corporate or other purposes. A higher level of indebtedness increases the risk that our financial flexibility may deteriorate. Our ability to meet our debt obligations and service our debt depends on future performance. General economic conditions, crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and synthetic crude oil prices, and financial, business and other factors will affect our operations and our future performance. Many of these factors are beyond our control and we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to pay the interest on our debt, and future working capital, borrowings and equity financing may not be available to pay or refinance such debt. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of debt obligations. A further downgrade in our credit rating could negatively impact our cost of and ability to access capital, which could adversely affect our business. 23We receive debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies in the United States. Due to the decline in crude oil and U.S. natural gas prices in recent years, credit rating agencies reviewed companies in the energy industry, including us. In the first quarter of 2016, our corporate credit rating was downgraded by Standard & Poor's Global Ratings to BBB- (stable) from BBB (stable), by Fitch Ratings to BBB (negative) from BBB+ (stable) and by Moody's Investor Services, Inc. to Ba1 (negative) from Baa1 (stable). On October 11, 2016 Moody's subsequently revised their outlook of our corporate credit rating to stable from negative. The credit rating process is contingent upon a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. A further downgrade of our credit ratings could negatively impact our cost of capital and our ability to access the capital markets, increase the interest rate and fees we pay on our revolving credit facility, and may limit or reduce credit lines with our bank counterparties. We could also be required to post letters of credit or other forms of collateral for certain contractual obligations, which could increase our costs and decrease our liquidity or letter of credit capacity under our unsecured revolving credit facility. Limitations on our ability to access capital could adversely impact the level of our capital spending program, our ability to manage our debt maturities, or our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions.Our commodity price risk management activities may prevent us from fully benefiting from commodity price increases and may expose us to other risks, including counterparty risk.Global commodity prices are volatile. In order to mitigate commodity price volatility and increase the predictability of cash flows related to the marketing of our crude oil and natural gas, we, from time to time, enter into crude oil and natural gas hedging arrangements with respect to a portion of our expected production. While hedging arrangements are intended to mitigate commodity price volatility, we may be prevented from fully realizing the benefits of price increases above the price levels of the derivative instruments used to manage price risk. In addition, our hedging arrangements may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including instances in which the counterparties to our hedging contracts fail to perform under the contracts. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.Our business could be negatively impacted by cyber-attacks targeting our computer and telecommunications systems and infrastructure. Our business, like other companies in the oil and gas industry, has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies. Such technologies are integrated into our business operations and used as a part of our crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and synthetic crude oil production and distribution systems in the U.S. and abroad, including those systems used to transport production to market. Use of the internet and other public networks for communications, services, and storage, including “cloud” computing, exposes users (including our business) to cybersecurity risks. While our information systems and related infrastructure experienced attempted and actual minor breaches of our cybersecurity in the past, we have not suffered any losses or breaches which had a material effect on our business, operations or reputation relating to such attacks; however, there is no assurance that we will not suffer such losses or breaches in the future. As cyber-attacks continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information systems and related infrastructure security vulnerabilities.Our operations may be adversely affected by pipeline, rail and other transportation capacity constraints.The marketability of our production depends in part on the availability, proximity, and capacity of pipeline facilities, rail cars, trucks and vessels. If any pipelines, rail cars, trucks or vessels become unavailable, we would, to the extent possible, be required to find a suitable alternative to transport our crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and synthetic crude oil, which could increase the costs and/or reduce the revenues we might obtain from the sale of our production. Both the cost and availability of pipelines, rail cars, trucks, or vessels to transport our crude oil could be adversely impacted by new and expected state or federal regulations relating to transportation of crude oil.If we acquire crude oil and natural gas properties, our failure to fully identify existing and potential problems, to accurately estimate reserves, production rates or costs, or to effectively integrate the acquired properties into our operations could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.We typically seek the acquisition of crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and synthetic crude oil properties. Although we perform reviews of properties to be acquired in a manner that we believe is diligent and consistent with industry practices, reviews of records and properties may not necessarily reveal existing or potential problems, nor may they permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties in order to fully assess possible deficiencies and potential problems. Even when problems with a property are identified, we often assume environmental and other risks and liabilities in connection with acquired properties pursuant to the acquisition agreements. Moreover, there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserves (as previously discussed), actual future production rates and associated costs with respect to acquired properties. Actual reserves, production rates and costs may vary substantially from those assumed in our estimates. In addition, an acquisition may have a material and adverse effect on our business and results of operations, particularly during the periods in which the operations of the acquired 24properties are being integrated into our ongoing operations or if we are unable to effectively integrate the acquired properties into our ongoing operations.We operate in a highly competitive industry, and many of our competitors are larger and have available resources in excess of our own. The oil and gas industry is highly competitive, and many competitors, including major integrated and independent oil and gas companies, as well as national oil companies, are larger and have substantially greater resources at their disposal than we do. We compete with these companies for the acquisition of oil and natural gas leases and other properties. We also compete with these companies for equipment and personnel, including petroleum engineers, geologists, geophysicists and other specialists, required to develop and operate those properties and in the marketing of crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and synthetic crude oil to end-users. Such competition can significantly increase costs and affect the availability of resources, which could provide our larger competitors a competitive advantage when acquiring equipment, leases and other properties. They may also be able to use their greater resources to attract and retain experienced personnel. Many of our major projects and operations are conducted with partners, which may decrease our ability to manage risk.We often enter into arrangements to conduct certain business operations, such as oil and gas exploration and production, or oil sands mining, with partners in order to share risks associated with those operations. However, these arrangements also may decrease our ability to manage risks and costs, particularly where we are not the operator. We could have limited influence over and control of the behaviors and performance of these operations. In addition, misconduct, fraud, noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations or improper activities by or on behalf of one or more of our partners could have a significant negative impact on our business and reputation.Our operations are subject to business interruptions and casualty losses. We do not insure against all potential losses and therefore we could be seriously harmed by unexpected liabilities and increased costs.Our North America E&P and International E&P operations are subject to unplanned occurrences, including blowouts, explosions, fires, loss of well control, spills, hurricanes and other adverse weather, tsunamis, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions or nuclear or other disasters, labor disputes and accidents. Our OSM operations are subject to business interruptions due to breakdown or failure of equipment or processes and unplanned events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions or other interruptions. These same risks can be applied to the third-parties which transport our products from our facilities. A prolonged disruption in the ability of any pipelines, rail cars, trucks, or vessels to transport our production could contribute to a business interruption or increase costs.Our operations are also subject to the additional hazards of pollution, releases of toxic gas and other environmental hazards and risks. These hazards could result in serious personal injury or loss of human life, significant damage to property and equipment, environmental pollution, impairment of operations and substantial losses to us. Various hazards have adversely affected us in the past, and damages resulting from a catastrophic occurrence in the future involving us or any of our assets or operations may result in our being named as a defendant in one or more lawsuits asserting potentially large claims or in our being assessed potentially substantial fines by governmental authorities. We maintain insurance against many, but not all, potential losses or liabilities arising from operating hazards in amounts that we believe to be prudent. Uninsured losses and liabilities arising from operating hazards could reduce the funds available to us for capital, exploration and investment spending and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Historically, we have maintained insurance coverage for physical damage and resulting business interruption to our major onshore and offshore facilities, with significant self-insured retentions. In the future, we may not be able to maintain or obtain insurance of the type and amount we desire at reasonable rates. As a result of market conditions, premiums and deductibles for our insurance policies will change over time and could escalate. In some instances, certain insurance could become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. For example, due to historical hurricane activity, the availability of insurance coverage for windstorms has changed and, in some instances, it is uneconomical. As a result, our exposure to losses from future windstorm activity has increased.Litigation by private plaintiffs or government officials could adversely affect our performance.We currently are defending litigation and anticipate that we will be required to defend new litigation in the future. The subject matter of such litigation may include releases of hazardous substances from our facilities, privacy laws, contract disputes, royalty disputes or any other laws or regulations that apply to our operations. In some cases the plaintiff or plaintiffs seek alleged damages involving large classes of potential litigants, and may allege damages relating to extended periods of time or other alleged facts and circumstances. If we are not able to successfully defend such claims, they may result in substantial liability. We do not have insurance covering all of these potential liabilities. In addition to substantial liability, litigation may also seek injunctive relief which could have an adverse effect on our future operations.25In connection with our separation from MPC, MPC agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities. However, there can be no assurance that the indemnity will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities, or that MPC’s ability to satisfy its indemnification obligations will not be impaired in the future.Pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement and the Tax Sharing Agreement we entered into with MPC in connection with the spin-off, MPC agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities. However, third parties could seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that MPC agreed to retain or assume, and there can be no assurance that the indemnification from MPC will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities, or that MPC will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations. In addition, even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from MPC any amounts for which we are held liable, we may be temporarily required to bear these losses ourselves.The spin-off could result in substantial tax liability.We obtained a private letter ruling from the IRS substantially to the effect that the distribution of shares of MPC common stock in the spin-off qualified as tax free to MPC, us and our stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 355 and 368 and related provisions of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). If the factual assumptions or representations made in the request for the private letter ruling prove to have been inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect, then we will not be able to rely on the ruling. Furthermore, the IRS does not rule on whether a distribution such as the spin-off satisfies certain requirements necessary to obtain tax-free treatment under Section 355 of the Code. Rather, the private letter ruling was based on representations by us that those requirements were satisfied, and any inaccuracy in those representations could invalidate the ruling. In connection with the spin-off, we also obtained an opinion of outside counsel, substantially to the effect that, the distribution of shares of MPC common stock in the spin-off qualified as tax free to MPC, us and our stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 355 and 368 and related provisions of the Code. The opinion relied on, among other things, the continuing validity of the private letter ruling and various assumptions and representations as to factual matters made by MPC and us which, if inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect, would jeopardize the conclusions reached by such counsel in its opinion. The opinion is not binding on the IRS or the courts, and there can be no assurance that the IRS or the courts would not challenge the conclusions stated in the opinion or that any such challenge would not prevail.If, notwithstanding receipt of the private letter ruling and opinion of counsel, the spin-off were determined not to qualify under Section 355 of the Code, each U.S. holder of our common stock who received shares of MPC common stock in the spin-off would generally be treated as receiving a taxable distribution of property in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares of MPC common stock received. That distribution would be taxable to each such stockholder as a dividend to the extent of our accumulated earnings and profits as of the effective date of the spin-off. For each such stockholder, any amount that exceeded those earnings and profits would be treated first as a non-taxable return of capital to the extent of such stockholder’s tax basis in its shares of our common stock with any remaining amount being taxed as a capital gain. We would be subject to tax as if we had sold all the outstanding shares of MPC common stock in a taxable sale for their fair market value and would recognize taxable gain in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of such shares over our tax basis in such shares.Under the terms of the Tax Sharing Agreement we entered into with MPC in connection with the spin-off, MPC is generally responsible for any taxes imposed on MPC or us and our subsidiaries in the event that the spin-off and/or certain related transactions were to fail to qualify for tax-free treatment as a result of actions taken, or breaches of representations and warranties made in the Tax Sharing Agreement, by MPC or any of its affiliates. However, if the spin-off and/or certain related transactions were to fail to qualify for tax-free treatment because of actions or failures to act by us or any of our affiliates, we would be responsible for all such taxes.We may issue preferred stock whose terms could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of Marathon Oil common stock.Our restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such preferences, powers and relative, participating, optional and other rights, including preferences over Marathon Oil common stock respecting dividends and distributions, as our Board of Directors generally may determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of Marathon Oil common stock. For example, we could grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the common stock.Item 1B.
