RISK FACTORS  Our financial results are affected by volatile refining margins and global economic activity.  Our financial results are primarily affected by the relationship, or margin, between refined product prices and the prices for crude oil and other feedstocks. Our cost to acquire feedstocks and the price at which we can ultimately sell refined products depend upon several factors beyond our control, including regional and global supply of and demand for crude oil, gasoline, diesel, and other feedstocks and refined products. These in turn depend on, among other things, the availability and quantity of imports, the production levels of domestic and foreign suppliers, levels of refined product inventories, productivity and growth (or the lack thereof) of U.S. and global economies, U.S. relationships with foreign governments, political affairs, and the extent of governmental regulation. Historically, refining margins have been volatile, and we believe they will continue to be volatile in the future.  Continued economic turmoil and hostilities, including the threat of future terrorist attacks, could affect the economies of the United States and other countries. Lower levels of economic activity during periods of recession could result in declines in energy consumption, including declines in the demand for and consumption of our refined products, which could cause our revenues and margins to decline and limit our future growth prospects.  Refining margins are also significantly impacted by additional refinery conversion capacity through the expansion of existing refineries or the construction of new refineries. Worldwide refining capacity expansions may result in refining production capability far exceeding refined product demand, which would have a significant adverse effect on refining margins.  A significant portion of our profitability is derived from the ability to purchase and process crude oil feedstocks that historically have been cheaper than benchmark crude oils, such as West Texas Intermediate crude oil. These crude oil feedstock differentials vary significantly depending on overall economic conditions and trends and conditions within the markets for crude oil and refined products, and they could decline in the future, which would have a negative impact on our earnings.  Uncertainty and illiquidity in credit and capital markets can impair our ability to obtain credit and financing on acceptable terms, and can adversely affect the financial strength of our business partners.  Our ability to obtain credit and capital depends in large measure on capital markets and liquidity factors over which we exert no control. Our ability to access credit and capital markets may be restricted at a time when we would like, or need, to access those markets, which could have an impact on our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions. In addition, the cost and availability of debt and equity financing may be adversely impacted by unstable or illiquid market conditions. Protracted uncertainty and illiquidity in these markets also could have an adverse impact on our lenders, commodity hedging counterparties, or our customers, causing them to fail to meet their obligations to us. In addition, decreased returns on pension fund assets may also materially increase our pension funding requirements.  We currently maintain investment-grade ratings by Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services (S&P), Moody’s Investors Service (Moody’s), and Fitch Ratings (Fitch) on our senior unsecured debt. (Ratings from credit agencies are not recommendations to buy, sell, or hold our securities. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.) We cannot provide assurance that any of our current ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances so warrant. Specifically, if S&P, Moody’s, or Fitch were to downgrade our long-term rating, particularly below investment grade, our borrowing costs would increase, which could adversely affect our ability to attract potential investors and our  13    Table of Contents  funding sources could decrease. In addition, we may not be able to obtain favorable credit terms from our suppliers or they may require us to provide collateral, letters of credit, or other forms of security which would increase our operating costs. As a result, a downgrade in our credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on our future operations and financial position.  From time to time, our cash needs may exceed our internally generated cash flow, and our business could be materially and adversely affected if we were unable to obtain necessary funds from financing activities. From time to time, we may need to supplement our cash generation with proceeds from financing activities. We have existing revolving credit facilities, committed letter of credit facilities, and an accounts receivable sales facility to provide us with available financing to meet our ongoing cash needs. Uncertainty and illiquidity continues to exist in the financial markets that may materially impact the ability of the participating financial institutions to fund their commitments to us under our various financing facilities. In light of these uncertainties and the volatile current market environment, we can make no assurances that we will be able to obtain the full amount of the funds available under our financing facilities to satisfy our cash requirements. Our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial position.  Compliance with and changes in environmental laws, including proposed climate change laws and regulations, could adversely affect our performance.  The principal environmental risks associated with our operations are emissions into the air and releases into the soil, surface water, or groundwater. Our operations are subject to extensive federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to the discharge of materials into the environment, waste management, pollution prevention measures, greenhouse gas emissions, and characteristics and composition of gasoline and diesel fuels. If we violate or fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned. Because environmental laws and regulations are becoming more stringent and new environmental laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed, such as those relating to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change (e.g., California’s AB-32 “Global Warming Solutions Act,” the U.S. House of Representatives’ “American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009,” the U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works’ “Clean Energy Jobs and American Power Act of 2009,” initiatives and rulemaking following the EPA’s 2009 “Endangerment and Cause or Contribute Findings for Greenhouse Gases Under Section 202(a) of the Clean Air Act”), the level of expenditures required for environmental matters could increase in the future. Future legislative action and regulatory initiatives could result in changes to operating permits, additional remedial actions, material changes in operations, increased capital expenditures and operating costs, increased costs of the goods we sell, and decreased demand for our products that cannot be assessed with certainty at this time.  Some of the proposed federal “cap-and-trade” legislation would require businesses that emit greenhouse gases to buy emission credits from the government, other businesses, or through an auction process. In addition, refiners would be obligated to purchase emission credits associated with the transportation fuels (gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel) sold and consumed in the United States. As a result of such a program, we would be required to purchase emission credits for greenhouse gas emissions resulting from our own operations as well as from the fuels we sell. Although it is not possible at this time to predict the final form of a cap-and-trade bill (or whether such a bill will be passed by Congress), any new federal restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions – including a cap-and-trade program – could result in material increased compliance costs, additional operating restrictions for our business, and an increase in the cost of the products we produce, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.  14    Table of Contents  Disruption of our ability to obtain crude oil could adversely affect our operations.  A significant portion of our feedstock requirements is satisfied through supplies originating in the Middle East, Africa, Asia, North America, and South America. We are, therefore, subject to the political, geographic, and economic risks attendant to doing business with suppliers located in, and supplies originating from, those areas. If one or more of our supply contracts were terminated, or if political events disrupt our traditional crude oil supply, we believe that adequate alternative supplies of crude oil would be available, but it is possible that we would be unable to find alternative sources of supply. If we are unable to obtain adequate crude oil volumes or are able to obtain such volumes only at unfavorable prices, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected, including reduced sales volumes of refined products or reduced margins as a result of higher crude oil costs.  In addition, the U.S. government can prevent or restrict us from doing business in or with foreign countries. These restrictions, and those of foreign governments, could limit our ability to gain access to business opportunities in various countries. Actions by both the United States and foreign countries have affected our operations in the past and will continue to do so in the future.  Competitors that produce their own supply of feedstocks, have more extensive retail outlets, or have greater financial resources may have a competitive advantage.  The refining and marketing industry is highly competitive with respect to both feedstock supply and refined product markets. We compete with many companies for available supplies of crude oil and other feedstocks and for outlets for our refined products. We do not produce any of our crude oil feedstocks. Many of our competitors, however, obtain a significant portion of their feedstocks from company-owned production and some have more extensive retail outlets than we have. Competitors that have their own production or extensive retail outlets (and greater brand-name recognition) are at times able to offset losses from refining operations with profits from producing or retailing operations, and may be better positioned to withstand periods of depressed refining margins or feedstock shortages.  Some of our competitors also have materially greater financial and other resources than we have. Such competitors have a greater ability to bear the economic risks inherent in all phases of our industry. In addition, we compete with other industries that provide alternative means to satisfy the energy and fuel requirements of our industrial, commercial, and individual consumers.  A significant interruption in one or more of our refineries could adversely affect our business.  Our refineries are our principal operating assets. As a result, our operations could be subject to significant interruption if one or more of our refineries were to experience a major accident or mechanical failure, encounter work stoppages relating to organized labor issues, be damaged by severe weather or other natural or man-made disaster, such as an act of terrorism, or otherwise be forced to shut down. If any refinery were to experience an interruption in operations, earnings from the refinery could be materially adversely affected (to the extent not recoverable through insurance) because of lost production and repair costs. A significant interruption in one or more of our refineries could also lead to increased volatility in prices for crude oil feedstocks and refined products, and could increase instability in the financial and insurance markets, making it more difficult for us to access capital and to obtain insurance coverage that we consider adequate.  We maintain insurance against many, but not all, potential losses arising from operating hazards. Failure by one or more insurers to honor its coverage commitments for an insured event could materially and adversely affect our future cash flows, operating results, and financial condition.  Our refining and marketing operations are subject to various hazards common to the industry, including explosions, fires, toxic emissions, maritime hazards, and natural catastrophes. As protection against these  15    Table of Contents  hazards, we maintain insurance coverage against some, but not all, such potential losses and liabilities. We may not be able to maintain or obtain insurance of the type and amount we desire at reasonable rates. As a result of market conditions, premiums and deductibles for certain of our insurance policies have increased substantially, and could escalate further. In some instances, certain insurance could become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. For example, coverage for hurricane damage is very limited, and coverage for terrorism risks includes very broad exclusions. If we were to incur a significant liability for which we were not fully insured, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position. Our insurance program includes a number of insurance carriers. Disruptions in the U.S. financial markets have resulted in the deterioration in the financial condition of many financial institutions, including insurance companies. We are not currently aware of any information that would indicate that any of our insurers is unlikely to perform in the event of a covered incident. However, in light of this uncertainty and the volatile current market environment, we can make no assurances that we will be able to obtain the full amount of our insurance coverage for insured events.  Compliance with and changes in tax laws could adversely affect our performance.  We are subject to extensive tax liabilities, including United States, state, and foreign income taxes and transactional taxes such as excise, sales/use, payroll, franchise, withholding, and ad valorem taxes. New tax laws and regulations and changes in existing tax laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed that could result in increased expenditures for tax liabilities in the future. Many of these liabilities are subject to periodic audits by the respective taxing authority. Subsequent changes to our tax liabilities as a result of these audits may subject us to interest and penalties.  16    Table of Contents     ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS  We incorporate by reference into this Item the environmental disclosures contained in the following sections of this report:       •   Item 1 under the caption “Risk Factors – Compliance with and changes in environmental laws, including proposed climate change laws and regulations, could adversely affect our performance,”        •   Item 3 “Legal Proceedings” under the caption “Environmental Enforcement Matters,” and        •   Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in Note 24 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under the caption “Environmental Matters.”    Capital Expenditures Attributable to Compliance with Environmental Regulations.
