RISK FACTORS  Our financial results are affected by volatile refining margins.  Our financial results are primarily affected by the relationship, or margin, between refined product prices and the prices for crude oil and other feedstocks. Our cost to acquire feedstocks and the price at which we can ultimately sell refined products depend upon several factors beyond our control, including regional and global supply of and demand for crude oil, gasoline, diesel, and other feedstocks and refined products. These in turn depend on, among other things, the availability and quantity of imports, the production levels of domestic and foreign suppliers, levels of refined product inventories, U.S. relationships with foreign governments, political affairs, and the extent of governmental regulation. Historically, refining margins have been volatile, and we believe they will continue to be volatile in the future.  Compliance with and changes in environmental laws could adversely affect our performance.  The principal environmental risks associated with our operations are emissions into the air and releases into the soil, surface water, or groundwater. Our operations are subject to extensive federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to the discharge of materials into the environment, waste management, pollution prevention measures, greenhouse gas emissions, and characteristics and composition of gasoline and diesel fuels. If we violate or fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned. Because environmental laws and regulations are becoming more stringent and new environmental laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed, such as those relating to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change (e.g., California’s AB-32 “Global Warming Solutions Act”), the level of expenditures required for environmental matters could increase in the future. Future legislative action and regulatory initiatives could result in changes to operating permits, additional remedial actions, or increased capital expenditures and operating costs that cannot be assessed with certainty at this time. In addition, any major upgrades in any of our refineries could require material additional expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations.  Disruption of our ability to obtain crude oil could adversely affect our operations.  A significant portion of our feedstock requirements is satisfied through supplies originating in Saudi Arabia, Mexico, Iraq, Kuwait, Venezuela, Colombia, and Africa. We are, therefore, subject to the political, geographic, and economic risks attendant to doing business with suppliers located in, and supplies originating from, those areas. If one or more of our supply contracts were terminated, or if political events disrupt our traditional crude oil supply, we believe that adequate alternative supplies of crude oil would be available, but it is possible that we would be unable to find alternative sources of supply. If we are unable to obtain adequate crude oil volumes or are able to obtain such volumes only at unfavorable prices, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected, including reduced sales volumes of refined products or reduced margins as a result of higher crude oil costs.  Competitors that produce their own supply of feedstocks, have more extensive retail outlets, or have greater financial resources may have a competitive advantage.  The refining and marketing industry is highly competitive with respect to both feedstock supply and refined product markets. We compete with many companies for available supplies of crude oil and other feedstocks and for outlets for our refined products. We do not produce any of our crude oil feedstocks. Many of our competitors, however, obtain a significant portion of their feedstocks from company-owned production and some have more extensive retail outlets than we have. Competitors that have their own production or extensive retail outlets (and greater brand-name recognition) are at times able to offset losses from refining operations with profits from producing or retailing operations, and may be better positioned to withstand periods of depressed refining margins or feedstock shortages.  11    Table of Contents  Some of our competitors also have materially greater financial and other resources than we have. Such competitors have a greater ability to bear the economic risks inherent in all phases of our industry. In addition, we compete with other industries that provide alternative means to satisfy the energy and fuel requirements of our industrial, commercial, and individual consumers.  A significant interruption in one or more of our refineries could adversely affect our business.  Our refineries are our principal operating assets. As a result, our operations could be subject to significant interruption if one or more of our refineries were to experience a major accident or mechanical failure, be damaged by severe weather or other natural or man-made disaster, such as an act of terrorism, or otherwise be forced to shut down. If any refinery were to experience an interruption in operations, earnings from the refinery could be materially adversely affected (to the extent not recoverable through insurance) because of lost production and repair costs.  Our operations expose us to many operating risks, not all of which are insured.  Our refining and marketing operations are subject to various hazards common to the industry, including explosions, fires, toxic emissions, maritime hazards, and uncontrollable flows of oil and gas. They are also subject to the additional hazards of loss from severe weather conditions. As protection against operating hazards, we maintain insurance coverage against some, but not all, such potential losses. We may not be able to maintain or obtain insurance of the type and amount we desire at reasonable rates. As a result of market conditions, premiums and deductibles for certain of our insurance policies have increased substantially, and could escalate further. In some instances, certain insurance could become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. For example, insurance carriers are now requiring broad exclusions for losses due to war risk and terrorist acts. If we were to incur a significant liability for which we were not fully insured, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position.  Compliance with and changes in tax laws could adversely affect our performance.  We are subject to extensive tax liabilities, including federal, state, and foreign income taxes and transactional taxes such as excise, sales/use, payroll, franchise, withholding, and ad valorem taxes. New tax laws and regulations and changes in existing tax laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed that could result in increased expenditures for tax liabilities in the future. Many of these liabilities are subject to periodic audits by the respective taxing authority. Subsequent changes to our tax liabilities as a result of these audits may subject us to interest and penalties.  12    Table of Contents     ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS  We incorporate by reference into this Item the environmental disclosures contained in the following sections of this report:       •   Item 1 under the caption “Risk Factors - Compliance with and changes in environmental laws could adversely affect our performance,”        •   Item 3 “Legal Proceedings” under the caption “Environmental Enforcement Matters,” and        •   Item 8 “Financial Statements” in Note 23 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.    Capital Expenditures Attributable to Compliance with Environmental Regulations. In 2007, our capital expenditures attributable to compliance with environmental regulations were $614 million, and are currently estimated to be approximately $575 million for 2008 and approximately $665 million for 2009. The estimates for 2008 and 2009 do not include amounts related to capital investments at our facilities that management has deemed to be strategic investments rather than expenditures relating to environmental regulatory compliance.     PROPERTIES  Our principal properties are described above under the caption “Valero’s Operations,” and that information is incorporated herein by reference. We also own feedstock and refined product storage facilities in various locations. We believe that our properties and facilities are generally adequate for our operations and that our facilities are maintained in a good state of repair. As of December 31, 2007, we were the lessee under a number of cancelable and non-cancelable leases for certain properties. Our leases are discussed more fully in Note 22 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  Our patents relating to our refining operations are not material to us as a whole.
