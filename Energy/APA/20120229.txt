ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS  Our business activities and the value of our securities are subject to significant hazards and risks, including those described below. If any of such events should occur, our business, financial condition, liquidity, and/or results of operations could be materially harmed, and holders and purchasers of our securities could lose part or all of their investments. Additional risks relating to our securities may be included in the prospectuses for securities we issue in the future.  Future economic conditions in the U.S. and key international markets may materially adversely impact our operating results.  The U.S. and other world economies are slowly recovering from a global financial crisis and recession that began in 2008. Growth has resumed but is modest and at an unsteady rate. There are likely to be significant long-term effects resulting from the recession and credit market crisis, including a future global economic growth rate that is slower than in the years leading up to the crisis, and more volatility may occur before a sustainable, yet lower, growth rate is achieved. Global economic growth drives demand for energy from all sources, including fossil fuels. A lower future economic growth rate could result in decreased demand growth for our crude oil and natural gas production as well as lower commodity prices, which would reduce our cash flows from operations and our profitability.  In addition, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has encouraged countries with large federal budget deficits to initiate deficit reduction measures. As a result of the European sovereign debt crisis, certain European countries have initiated austerity measures. Such deficit reduction measures, if they are undertaken too rapidly, could further undermine economic recovery and slow growth by reducing demand.  Crude oil and natural gas prices are volatile, and a substantial reduction in these prices could adversely affect our results and the price of our common stock.  Our revenues, operating results and future rate of growth depend highly upon the prices we receive for our crude oil and natural gas production. Historically, the markets for crude oil and natural gas have been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile in the future. For example, the NYMEX daily settlement price for the prompt month oil contract in 2011 ranged from a high of $113.93 per barrel to a low of $75.67 per barrel. The NYMEX daily settlement price for the prompt month natural gas contract in 2011 ranged from a high of $4.85 per MMBtu to a low of $2.99 per MMBtu. The market prices for crude oil and natural gas depend on factors beyond our control. These factors include demand for crude oil and natural gas, which fluctuates with changes in market and economic conditions, and other factors, including:        •    worldwide and domestic supplies of crude oil and natural gas;        •    actions taken by foreign oil and gas producing nations;        •    political conditions and events (including instability, changes in governments, or armed conflict) in crude oil or natural gas producing regions;        •    the level of global crude oil and natural gas inventories;        •    the price and level of imported foreign crude oil and natural gas;        •    the price and availability of alternative fuels, including coal and biofuels;        •    the availability of pipeline capacity and infrastructure;        •    the availability of crude oil transportation and refining capacity;    23    Table of Contents     •    weather conditions;        •    electricity generation;        •    domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes; and        •    the overall economic environment.    Significant declines in crude oil and natural gas prices for an extended period may have the following effects on our business:        •    limiting our financial condition, liquidity, and/or ability to fund planned capital expenditures and operations;        •    reducing the amount of crude oil and natural gas that we can produce economically;        •    causing us to delay or postpone some of our capital projects;        •    reducing our revenues, operating income, and cash flows;        •    limiting our access to sources of capital, such as equity and long-term debt;        •    a reduction in the carrying value of our crude oil and natural gas properties; or        •    a reduction in the carrying value of goodwill.  Our ability to sell natural gas or oil and/or receive market prices for our natural gas or oil may be adversely affected by pipeline and gathering system capacity constraints and various transportation interruptions.  A portion of our natural gas and oil production in any region may be interrupted, or shut in, from time to time for numerous reasons, including as a result of weather conditions, accidents, loss of pipeline or gathering system access, field labor issues or strikes, or capital constraints that limit the ability of third parties to construct gathering systems, processing facilities, or interstate pipelines to transport our production, or we might voluntarily curtail production in response to market conditions. If a substantial amount of our production is interrupted at the same time, it could temporarily adversely affect our cash flows.  Weather and climate may have a significant adverse impact on our revenues and productivity.  Demand for oil and natural gas are, to a significant degree, dependent on weather and climate, which impact the price we receive for the commodities we produce. In addition, our exploration and development activities and equipment can be adversely affected by severe weather, such as hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico or cyclones offshore Australia, which may cause a loss of production from temporary cessation of activity or lost or damaged equipment. Our planning for normal climatic variation, insurance programs, and emergency recovery plans may inadequately mitigate the effects of such weather conditions, and not all such effects can be predicted, eliminated, or insured against.  Our operations involve a high degree of operational risk, particularly risk of personal injury, damage, or loss of equipment, and environmental accidents.  Our operations are subject to hazards and risks inherent in the drilling, production, and transportation of crude oil and natural gas, including:        •    drilling well blowouts, explosions, and cratering;    24    Table of Contents     •    pipeline ruptures and spills;        •    fires;        •    formations with abnormal pressures;        •    equipment malfunctions; and        •    hurricanes and/or cyclones, which could affect our operations in areas such as on- and offshore the Gulf Coast and Australia, and other natural disasters.  Failure or loss of equipment, as the result of equipment malfunctions, cyber-attacks, or natural disasters such as hurricanes, could result in property damages, personal injury, environmental pollution and other damages for which we could be liable. Litigation arising from a catastrophic occurrence, such as a well blowout, explosion, or fire at a location where our equipment and services are used, may result in substantial claims for damages. Ineffective containment of a drilling well blowout or pipeline rupture could result in extensive environmental pollution and substantial remediation expenses. If a significant amount of our production is interrupted, our containment efforts prove to be ineffective or litigation arises as the result of a catastrophic occurrence, our cash flows, and, in turn, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.  The Devon and Mariner transactions have increased our exposure to Gulf of Mexico operations.  Our 2010 acquisitions of oil and gas assets in offshore Gulf of Mexico from Devon Energy Corporation and Mariner Energy, Inc. have increased our exposure to offshore Gulf of Mexico operations. Greater offshore concentration proportionately increases risks from delays or higher costs common to offshore activity, including severe weather, availability of specialized equipment and compliance with environmental and other laws and regulations.  In addition, regulatory changes in the Gulf of Mexico after the Deepwater Horizon incident and the increased demand for drilling rigs and oilfield services since the resumption of activities in the Gulf may lead to higher costs and reduced availability of such rigs and services, making satisfactory returns on our investments in that region more difficult to achieve.  The additional deepwater drilling laws and regulations, delays in the processing and approval of permits and other related developments in the Gulf of Mexico as well as our other locations resulting from the Deepwater Horizon incident could adversely affect Apache’s business.  In response to the Deepwater Horizon incident in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico in April 2010, and as directed by the Secretary of the US Department of the Interior, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement (BOEMRE), now split into the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) and the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE), issued new guidelines and regulations regarding safety, environmental matters, drilling equipment, and decommissioning applicable to drilling in the Gulf of Mexico. These new requirements applicable to drilling activities in the Gulf of Mexico, have imposed additional requirements with respect to development and production activities in the Gulf of Mexico and have delayed the approval of applications to drill in both deepwater and shallow-water areas. In addition, the U.S. Department of the Interior (or BOEM/BSEE) requires that operators demonstrate their compliance with new regulations before they resume deepwater drilling. While certain new drilling plans and drilling permits have been approved during 2011, we cannot predict when development and production activities will return to previous levels of activity in the Gulf of Mexico.  Further, at this time, we cannot predict with any certainty what further impact, if any, the Deepwater Horizon incident may have on the regulation of offshore oil and gas exploration and development activity, or on    25    Table of Contents  the cost or availability of insurance coverage to cover the risks of such operations. The enactment of new or stricter regulations in the United States and other countries and increased liability for companies operating in this sector could adversely affect Apache’s operations in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico as well as in our other locations.  Our commodity price risk management and trading activities may prevent us from benefiting fully from price increases and may expose us to other risks.  To the extent that we engage in price risk management activities to protect ourselves from commodity price declines, we may be prevented from realizing the full benefits of price increases above the levels of the derivative instruments used to manage price risk. In addition, our hedging arrangements may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including instances in which:        •    our production falls short of the hedged volumes;        •    there is a widening of price-basis differentials between delivery points for our production and the delivery point assumed in the hedge arrangement;        •    the counterparties to our hedging or other price risk management contracts fail to perform under those arrangements; or        •    a sudden unexpected event materially impacts oil and natural gas prices.  The credit risk of financial institutions could adversely affect us.  We have exposure to different counterparties, and we have entered into transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, investment banks, insurance companies, other investment funds, and other institutions. These transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty. Deterioration in the credit markets may impact the credit ratings of our current and potential counterparties and affect their ability to fulfill their existing obligations to us and their willingness to enter into future transactions with us. We have exposure to financial institutions in the form of derivative transactions in connection with our hedges and insurance companies in the form of claims under our policies. In addition, if any lender under our credit facility is unable to fund its commitment, our liquidity will be reduced by an amount up to the aggregate amount of such lender’s commitment under our credit facility.  We are exposed to counterparty credit risk as a result of our receivables.  We are exposed to risk of financial loss from trade, joint venture, joint interest billing, and other receivables. We sell our crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs to a variety of purchasers. As operator, we pay expenses and bill our non-operating partners for their respective shares of costs. Some of our purchasers and non-operating partners may experience liquidity problems and may not be able to meet their financial obligations. Nonperformance by a trade creditor or non-operating partner could result in significant financial losses.  A downgrade in our credit rating could negatively impact our cost of and ability to access capital.  We receive debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies in the United States. Factors that may impact our credit ratings include debt levels, planned asset purchases or sales, and near-term and long-term production growth opportunities. Liquidity, asset quality, cost structure, product mix, and commodity pricing levels and others are also considered by the rating agencies. A ratings downgrade could adversely impact our ability to access debt markets in the future, increase the cost of future debt, and potentially require the Company to post letters of credit for certain obligations.   26    Table of Contents Market conditions may restrict our ability to obtain funds for future development and working capital needs, which may limit our financial flexibility.  While the credit markets have recovered in the wake of the global financial crises, they remain vulnerable to unpredictable shocks. We have a significant development project inventory and an extensive exploration portfolio, which will require substantial future investment. We and/or our partners may need to seek financing in order to fund these or other future activities. Our future access to capital, as well as that of our partners and contractors, could be limited if the debt or equity markets are constrained. This could significantly delay development of our property interests.  Our ability to declare and pay dividends is subject to limitations.  The payment of future dividends on our capital stock is subject to the discretion of our board of directors, which considers, among other factors, our operating results, overall financial condition, credit-risk considerations, and capital requirements, as well as general business and market conditions. Our board of directors is not required to declare dividends on our common stock and may decide not to declare dividends.  Any indentures and other financing agreements that we enter into in the future may limit our ability to pay cash dividends on our capital stock, including common stock. In the event that any of our indentures or other financing agreements in the future restrict our ability to pay dividends in cash on the mandatory convertible preferred stock, we may be unable to pay dividends in cash on the common stock unless we can refinance amounts outstanding under those agreements. In addition, under Delaware law, dividends on capital stock may only be paid from “surplus,” which is defined as the amount by which our total assets exceeds the sum of our total liabilities, including contingent liabilities, and the amount of our capital; if there is no surplus, cash dividends on capital stock may only be paid from our net profits for the then current and/or the preceding fiscal year. Further, even if we are permitted under our contractual obligations and Delaware law to pay cash dividends on common stock, we may not have sufficient cash to pay dividends in cash on our common stock.  Discoveries or acquisitions of additional reserves are needed to avoid a material decline in reserves and production.  The production rate from oil and gas properties generally declines as reserves are depleted, while related per-unit production costs generally increase as a result of decreasing reservoir pressures and other factors. Therefore, unless we add reserves through exploration and development activities or, through engineering studies, identify additional behind-pipe zones, secondary recovery reserves, or tertiary recovery reserves, or acquire additional properties containing proved reserves, our estimated proved reserves will decline materially as reserves are produced. Future oil and gas production is, therefore, highly dependent upon our level of success in acquiring or finding additional reserves on an economic basis. Furthermore, if oil or gas prices increase, our cost for additional reserves could also increase.  We may not realize an adequate return on wells that we drill.  Drilling for oil and gas involves numerous risks, including the risk that we will not encounter commercially productive oil or gas reservoirs. The wells we drill or participate in may not be productive, and we may not recover all or any portion of our investment in those wells. The seismic data and other technologies we use do not allow us to know conclusively prior to drilling a well that crude or natural gas is present or may be produced economically. The costs of drilling, completing, and operating wells are often uncertain, and drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed, or canceled as a result of a variety of factors including, but not limited to:        •    unexpected drilling conditions;        •    pressure or irregularities in formations;    27    Table of Contents     •    equipment failures or accidents;        •    fires, explosions, blowouts, and surface cratering;        •    marine risks such as capsizing, collisions, and hurricanes;        •    other adverse weather conditions; and        •    increase in the cost of, or shortages or delays in the availability of, drilling rigs and equipment.  Future drilling activities may not be successful, and, if unsuccessful, this failure could have an adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition. While all drilling, whether developmental or exploratory, involves these risks, exploratory drilling involves greater risks of dry holes or failure to find commercial quantities of hydrocarbons.  Material differences between the estimated and actual timing of critical events may affect the completion and commencement of production from development projects.  We are involved in several large development projects the completion of which may be delayed beyond our anticipated completion dates. Our projects may be delayed by project approvals from joint venture partners, timely issuances of permits and licenses by governmental agencies, weather conditions, manufacturing and delivery schedules of critical equipment, and other unforeseen events. Delays and differences between estimated and actual timing of critical events may adversely affect our large development projects and our ability to participate in large-scale development projects in the future.  We may fail to fully identify potential problems related to acquired reserves or to properly estimate those reserves.  Although we perform a review of properties that we acquire that we believe is consistent with industry practices, such reviews are inherently incomplete. It generally is not feasible to review in depth every individual property involved in each acquisition. Ordinarily, we will focus our review efforts on the higher-value properties and will sample the remainder. However, even a detailed review of records and properties may not necessarily reveal existing or potential problems, nor will it permit us as a buyer to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to assess fully and accurately their deficiencies and potential. Inspections may not always be performed on every well, and environmental problems, such as groundwater contamination, are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken. Even when problems are identified, we often assume certain environmental and other risks and liabilities in connection with acquired properties. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves and future production rates and costs with respect to acquired properties, and actual results may vary substantially from those assumed in the estimates. In addition, there can be no assurance that acquisitions will not have an adverse effect upon our operating results, particularly during the periods in which the operations of acquired businesses are being integrated into our ongoing operations.  Several significant matters in the BP Acquisition were not resolved before closing.  Because of the relatively short time period between signing the BP Purchase Agreements and the closing of the acquisition of the BP properties, several significant matters commonly resolved prior to closing such an acquisition were reserved for after closing. We did not have sufficient time before closing on the BP Properties to conduct a full environmental assessment. We may discover adverse environmental or other conditions after closing and after the time periods specified in the BP Purchase Agreements during which we may be able to seek, in certain cases, indemnification from or cure of the defect or adverse condition by BP for such matters. For example, Apache Canada Ltd. has asserted a claim against BP Canada arising from the acquisition of certain    28    Table of Contents  Canadian properties under the BP Purchase Agreements. The dispute centers on Apache Canada Ltd.’s identification of Alleged Adverse Conditions, as that term is defined in the BP Purchase Agreements, and more specifically, the contention that liabilities associated with such conditions were retained by BP Canada as seller. There can be no assurance that we will prevail on this or any future claim against BP.  The BP Acquisition and/or our liabilities could be adversely affected in the event one or more of the BP entities become the subject of a bankruptcy case.  In light of the extensive costs and liabilities related to the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010, there was public speculation as to whether one or more of the BP entities could become the subject of a case or proceeding under Title 11 of the United States Code or any other relevant insolvency law or similar law (which we collectively refer to as “Insolvency Laws”). In the event that one or more of the BP entities were to become the subject of such a case or proceeding, a court may find that the BP Purchase Agreements are executory contracts, in which case such BP entities may, subject to relevant Insolvency Laws, have the right to reject the agreements and refuse to perform their future obligations under them. In this event, our ability to enforce our rights under the BP Purchase Agreements could be adversely affected.  Additionally, in a case or proceeding under relevant Insolvency Laws, a court may find that the sale of the BP Properties constitutes a constructive fraudulent conveyance that should be set aside. While the tests for determining whether a transfer of assets constitutes a constructive fraudulent conveyance vary among jurisdictions, such a determination generally requires that the seller received less than a reasonably equivalent value in exchange for such transfer or obligation and the seller was insolvent at the time of the transaction, or was rendered insolvent or left with unreasonably small capital to meet its anticipated business needs as a result of the transaction. The applicable time periods for such a finding also vary among jurisdictions, but generally range from two to six years. If a court were to make such a determination in a proceeding under relevant Insolvency Laws, our rights under the BP Purchase Agreements, and our rights to the BP Properties, could be adversely affected.  Crude oil and natural gas reserves are estimates, and actual recoveries may vary significantly.  There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating crude oil and natural gas reserves and their value. Reservoir engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of crude oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner. Because of the high degree of judgment involved, the accuracy of any reserve estimate is inherently imprecise, and a function of the quality of available data and the engineering and geological interpretation. Our reserves estimates are based on 12-month average prices, except where contractual arrangements exist; therefore, reserves quantities will change when actual prices increase or decrease. In addition, results of drilling, testing, and production may substantially change the reserve estimates for a given reservoir over time. The estimates of our proved reserves and estimated future net revenues also depend on a number of factors and assumptions that may vary considerably from actual results, including:        •    historical production from the area compared with production from other areas;        •    the effects of regulations by governmental agencies, including changes to severance and excise taxes;        •    future operating costs and capital expenditures; and        •    workover and remediation costs.  For these reasons, estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of crude oil and natural gas attributable to any particular group of properties, classifications of those reserves and estimates of the future net cash flows expected from them prepared by different engineers or by the same engineers but at different times    29    Table of Contents  may vary substantially. Accordingly, reserves estimates may be subject to upward or downward adjustment, and actual production, revenue and expenditures with respect to our reserves likely will vary, possibly materially, from estimates.  Additionally, because some of our reserves estimates are calculated using volumetric analysis, those estimates are less reliable than the estimates based on a lengthy production history. Volumetric analysis involves estimating the volume of a reservoir based on the net feet of pay of the structure and an estimation of the area covered by the structure. In addition, realization or recognition of proved undeveloped reserves will depend on our development schedule and plans. A change in future development plans for proved undeveloped reserves could cause the discontinuation of the classification of these reserves as proved.  Certain of our undeveloped leasehold acreage is subject to leases that will expire over the next several years unless production is established on units containing the acreage.  A sizeable portion of our acreage is currently undeveloped. Unless production in paying quantities is established on units containing certain of these leases during their terms, the leases will expire. If our leases expire, we will lose our right to develop the related properties. Our drilling plans for these areas are subject to change based upon various factors, including drilling results, oil and natural gas prices, the availability and cost of capital, drilling, and production costs, availability of drilling services and equipment, gathering system and pipeline transportation constraints, and regulatory approvals.  We may incur significant costs related to environmental matters.  As an owner or lessee and operator of oil and gas properties, we are subject to various federal, provincial, state, local, and foreign country laws and regulations relating to discharge of materials into, and protection of, the environment. These laws and regulations may, among other things, impose liability on the lessee under an oil and gas lease for the cost of pollution clean-up resulting from operations, subject the lessee to liability for pollution damages and require suspension or cessation of operations in affected areas. Our efforts to limit our exposure to such liability and cost may prove inadequate and result in significant adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, it is possible that the increasingly strict requirements imposed by environmental laws and enforcement policies could require us to make significant capital expenditures. Such capital expenditures could adversely impact our cash flows and our financial condition.  Our North American operations are subject to governmental risks that may impact our operations.  Our North American operations have been, and at times in the future may be, affected by political developments and by federal, state, provincial, and local laws and regulations such as restrictions on production, changes in taxes, royalties and other amounts payable to governments or governmental agencies, price or gathering rate controls, and environmental protection laws and regulations. New political developments, laws, and regulations may adversely impact our results on operations.  Pending regulations related to emissions and the impact of any changes in climate could adversely impact our business.  Several countries where Apache operates including Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom either tax or assess some form of greenhouse gas (GHG) related fees on Company operations. Exposure has not been material to date, although under current regulations the rates and amounts of payments are expected to increase. Quantifying our total net financial exposure to GHG taxes in Australia awaits regulatory guidance and clarification, but we expect the value to be manageable within the context of our ongoing operations.  In the event the predictions for rising temperatures and sea levels suggested by reports of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change do transpire, we do not believe those events by themselves are likely    30    Table of Contents  to impact the Company’s assets or operations. However, any increase in severe weather could have a material adverse effect on our assets and operations. The proposed U.S. federal budget for fiscal year 2013 includes certain provisions that, if passed as originally submitted, will have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.  On February 13, 2012, the Office of Management and Budget released a summary of the proposed U.S. federal budget for fiscal year 2013. The proposed budget repeals many tax incentives and deductions that are currently used by U.S. oil and gas companies and imposes new taxes. The provisions include elimination of the ability to fully deduct intangible drilling costs in the year incurred; increases in the taxation of foreign source income; repeal of the manufacturing tax deduction for oil and natural gas companies; and an increase in the geological and geophysical amortization period for independent producers. Should some or all of these provisions become law, our taxes will increase, potentially significantly, which would have a negative impact on our net income and cash flows. This could also cause us to reduce our drilling activities in the U.S. Since none of these proposals have yet to be voted on or become law, we do not know the ultimate impact these proposed changes may have on our business.  Proposed federal, state, or local regulation regarding hydraulic fracturing could increase our operating and capital costs.  Several proposals are before the U.S. Congress that, if implemented, would either prohibit or restrict the practice of hydraulic fracturing or subject the process to regulation under the Safe Drinking Water Act. Several states are considering legislation to regulate hydraulic fracturing practices that could impose more stringent permitting, transparency, and well construction requirements on hydraulic-fracturing operations or otherwise seek to ban fracturing activities altogether. In addition, some municipalities have significantly limited or prohibited drilling activities and/or hydraulic fracturing, or are considering doing so. We routinely use fracturing techniques in the U.S. and other regions to expand the available space for natural gas and oil to migrate toward the wellbore. It is typically done at substantial depths in very tight formations.  Although it is not possible at this time to predict the final outcome of the legislation regarding hydraulic fracturing, any new federal, state, or local restrictions on hydraulic fracturing that may be imposed in areas in which we conduct business could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions in the U.S.  A deterioration of conditions in Egypt or changes in the economic and political environment in Egypt could have an adverse impact on our business.  In February 2011, the former Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak stepped down, and the Egyptian Supreme Council of the Armed Forces took power. In November 2011, Egypt held its first round of parliamentary elections. Despite the Muslim Brotherhood’s Freedom and Justice Party’s victory in the parliamentary elections, Egypt remains under martial law. The new Parliament remains subordinate to the Egyptian Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, which has stated its intention to turn over power to civilians following the presidential election expected in June 2012. Deterioration in the political, economic, and social conditions or other relevant policies of the Egyptian government, such as changes in laws or regulations, export restrictions, expropriation of our assets or resource nationalization, and/or forced renegotiation or modification of our existing contracts with EGPC could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Our operations in Egypt contributed 22 percent of our 2011 production and accounted for 10 percent of our year-end estimated proved reserves. At year-end 2011, 17 percent of our estimated discounted future net cash flows and 7.5 percent of our net capitalized oil and gas property was attributable to Egypt.    31    Table of Contents International operations have uncertain political, economic, and other risks.  Our operations outside North America are based primarily in Egypt, Australia, the United Kingdom, and Argentina. On a barrel equivalent basis, approximately 45 percent of our 2011 production was outside North America, and approximately 31 percent of our estimated proved oil and gas reserves on December 31, 2011 were located outside North America. As a result, a significant portion of our production and resources are subject to the increased political and economic risks and other factors associated with international operations including, but not limited to:        •    general strikes and civil unrest;        •    the risk of war, acts of terrorism, expropriation and resource nationalization, forced renegotiation or modification of existing contracts;        •    import and export regulations;        •    taxation policies, including royalty and tax increases and retroactive tax claims, and investment restrictions;        •    price control;        •    transportation regulations and tariffs;        •    constrained natural gas markets dependent on demand in a single or limited geographical area;        •    exchange controls, currency fluctuations, devaluation, or other activities that limit or disrupt markets and restrict payments or the movement of funds;        •    laws and policies of the United States affecting foreign trade, including trade sanctions;        •    the possibility of being subject to exclusive jurisdiction of foreign courts in connection with legal disputes relating to licenses to operate and concession rights in countries where we currently operate;        •    the possible inability to subject foreign persons, especially foreign oil ministries and national oil companies, to the jurisdiction of courts in the United States; and        •    difficulties in enforcing our rights against a governmental agency because of the doctrine of sovereign immunity and foreign sovereignty over international operations.  Foreign countries have occasionally asserted rights to oil and gas properties through border disputes. If a country claims superior rights to oil and gas leases or concessions granted to us by another country, our interests could decrease in value or be lost. Even our smaller international assets may affect our overall business and results of operations by distracting management’s attention from our more significant assets. Various regions of the world in which we operate have a history of political and economic instability. This instability could result in new governments or the adoption of new policies that might result in a substantially more hostile attitude toward foreign investments such as ours. In an extreme case, such a change could result in termination of contract rights and expropriation of our assets. This could adversely affect our interests and our future profitability.  The impact that future terrorist attacks or regional hostilities may have on the oil and gas industry in general, and on our operations in particular, is not known at this time. Uncertainty surrounding military strikes or a sustained military campaign may affect operations in unpredictable ways, including disruptions of fuel supplies and markets, particularly oil, and the possibility that infrastructure facilities, including pipelines, production    32    Table of Contents  facilities, processing plants, and refineries, could be direct targets of, or indirect casualties of, an act of terror or war. We may be required to incur significant costs in the future to safeguard our assets against terrorist activities.  In addition, continued regional conflict in the Middle East could have the following results, among others:        •    volatility in global crude prices, which could negatively impact the global economy, resulting in slower economic growth rates, which could reduce demand for our products;        •    negative impact on the world’s crude oil supply if transportation avenues are disrupted, leading to further commodity price volatility;        •    damage to or destruction of our wells, production facilities, receiving terminals, or other operating assets;        •    inability of our service equipment providers to deliver items necessary for us to conduct our operations in the Middle East;        •    lack of availability of drilling rigs, oilfield equipment, or services if third-party providers decide to exit the region.  Our operations are sensitive to currency rate fluctuations.  Our operations are sensitive to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly between the U.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar, the Australian dollar, and the British Pound. Our financial statements, presented in U.S. dollars, may be affected by foreign currency fluctuations through both translation risk and transaction risk. Volatility in exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations, particularly through the weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies.  We face strong industry competition that may have a significant negative impact on our results of operations.  Strong competition exists in all sectors of the oil and gas exploration and production industry. We compete with major integrated and other independent oil and gas companies for acquisition of oil and gas leases, properties, and reserves, equipment, and labor required to explore, develop, and operate those properties, and marketing of oil and natural gas production. Crude oil and natural gas prices impact the costs of properties available for acquisition and the number of companies with the financial resources to pursue acquisition opportunities. Many of our competitors have financial and other resources substantially larger than we possess and have established strategic long-term positions and maintain strong governmental relationships in countries in which we may seek new entry. As a consequence, we may be at a competitive disadvantage in bidding for drilling rights. In addition, many of our larger competitors may have a competitive advantage when responding to factors that affect demand for oil and natural gas production, such as fluctuating worldwide commodity prices and levels of production, the cost and availability of alternative fuels, and the application of government regulations. We also compete in attracting and retaining personnel, including geologists, geophysicists, engineers, and other specialists. These competitive pressures may have a significant negative impact on our results of operations.  Our insurance policies do not cover all of the risks we face, which could result in significant financial exposure.  Exploration for and production of crude oil and natural gas can be hazardous, involving natural disasters and other events such as blowouts, cratering, fire and explosion and loss of well control, which can result in damage to or destruction of wells or production facilities, injury to persons, loss of life, or damage to property and the    33    Table of Contents  environment. Our international operations are also subject to political risk. The insurance coverage that we maintain against certain losses or liabilities arising from our operations may be inadequate to cover any such resulting liability; moreover, insurance is not available to us against all operational risks.
