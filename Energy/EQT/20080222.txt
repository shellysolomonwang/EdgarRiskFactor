Item 1A. Risk Factors   Risks Relating to Our Business    In addition to the other information contained in this Form 10-K, the following risk factors should be considered in evaluating our business and future prospects. Please note that additional risks not presently known to us or that are currently considered immaterial may also have a negative impact on our business and operations. If any of the events or circumstances described below actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations could suffer and the trading price of our common stock could decline.    Natural gas price volatility may have an adverse effect on our revenue, profitability and liquidity.    Our revenue, profitability and liquidity depend on the price for natural gas. The markets for natural gas are volatile and fluctuations in prices will affect our financial results. Natural gas prices are affected by a number of factors beyond our control, which include: weather conditions; the supply of and demand for natural gas; national and worldwide economic and political conditions; the price and availability of alternative fuels; the proximity to, and availability of capacity on, transportation facilities; and government regulations, such as regulation of natural gas transportation, royalties and price controls.    Increases in natural gas prices may be accompanied by or result in increased well drilling costs, increased deferral of purchased gas costs for our distribution operations, increased production taxes, increased lease operating expenses, increased exposure to credit losses resulting from potential increases in uncollectible accounts receivable from our distribution customers, increased volatility in seasonal gas price spreads for our storage assets, and increased customer conservation or conversion to alternative fuels. Significant price increases subject us to margin calls on our commodity price derivative contracts (hedging arrangements, including futures contracts, swap agreements and exchange traded instruments) which would potentially require us to post significant amounts of cash collateral with our hedge counterparties. The cash collateral, which is interest-bearing, provided to our hedge counterparties is returned to us in whole or in part upon a reduction in forward market prices, depending on the amount of such reduction, or in whole upon settlement of the related hedged transaction. In such cases we are, however, exposed to the risk of non-performance by our hedge counterparties of their obligations under the derivative contracts. In addition, to the extent we have hedged our current production at prices below the current market price, we are unable to benefit fully from the increase in the price of natural gas.    Lower natural gas prices may result in downward adjustments to the value of our estimated proved reserves and cause us to incur non-cash charges to earnings. In addition, our reserves may be impacted by increases in our estimates of development costs or changes to our production assumptions which may change our production plans or may result in downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves and cause us to incur non-cash charges to earnings.    Our failure to assess production opportunities based on market conditions could negatively impact our long-term growth prospects for our production business.    Our goal of sustaining long-term growth for our production business is contingent upon our ability to identify production opportunities based on market conditions. Successfully identifying production opportunities involves a high degree of business experience, knowledge and careful evaluation of potential opportunities, along with subjective judgments and assumptions which may prove to be incorrect.    The amount and timing of actual future gas production is difficult to predict and may vary significantly from our estimates which may reduce our earnings.    Our future success depends on our ability to develop additional gas reserves that are economically recoverable and to maximize existing well production, and our failure to do so may reduce our earnings. We have expanded our drilling program in recent years and have announced plans to drill up to 750 wells in 2008, including a target of 250 to 300 horizontal wells. Our drilling of development wells can involve significant risks, including those related to timing and cost overruns and these risks can be affected by the availability of capital, leases, rigs and    12        a qualified work force, as well as weather conditions, gas price volatility, government approvals, title problems, geology and other factors. Drilling for natural gas can be unprofitable, not only from dry wells, but from productive wells that do not produce sufficient revenues to return a profit. Additionally, a failure to effectively operate existing wells may cause production volumes to fall short of our projections. Without continued successful development or acquisition activities, together with effective operation of existing wells, our reserves and revenues will decline as a result of our current reserves being depleted by production.    Our failure to develop and maintain the necessary infrastructure to successfully deliver gas to market may adversely affect our earnings, cash flows and results of operations.    Our gas delivery depends on the availability of adequate transportation infrastructure. As we previously announced, $568 million of our 2008 capital commitment budget is planned for investment in midstream infrastructure, which we expect will include significant new investment in transportation infrastructure as well as our continuing investment in the Big Sandy Pipeline and the Langley hydrocarbon processing plant. Investment in midstream infrastructure is intended to address a lack of capacity on, and access to, existing gathering and transportation pipelines as well as processing adjacent to and curtailments on such pipelines. Our infrastructure development program can involve significant risks, including those related to timing and cost overruns, and these risks can be affected by the availability of capital, materials, and qualified contractors and work force, as well as weather conditions, gas price volatility, government approvals, title problems, geology, compliance by third parties with their contractual obligations to us and other factors. We also deliver to and are served by third party gas gathering, transportation, processing and storage facilities which are limited in number and geographically concentrated. An extended interruption of access to or service from these facilities could result in material adverse consequences to us.    Volatility in the capital markets or downgrades to our credit ratings could increase our costs of borrowing adversely affecting our business, results of operations and liquidity.   We rely on access to both short-term bank and money markets and longer-term capital markets as a source of liquidity for any capital requirements not satisfied by the cash flow from operations. Market disruptions or any downgrade of our credit rating may increase the cost of borrowing or adversely affect our ability to raise capital through the issuance of debt or equity securities or other borrowing arrangements, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and liquidity. These disruptions could include an economic downturn, changes in capital market conditions generally and deterioration in the overall health of our industry.   We cannot be sure that our current ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that our rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency. An increase in the level of our indebtedness in the future may result in a downgrade in the ratings that are assigned to our debt. Any downgrade in our rating could result in an increase in our borrowing costs, which would diminish financial results.    We are subject to risks associated with the operation of our wells, pipelines and facilities.    Our business operations are subject to all of the inherent hazards and risks normally incidental to the production, transportation, storage and distribution of natural gas. These risks could result in substantial losses due to personal injury and/or loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment and pollution or other environmental damage. As a result, we are sometimes a defendant in legal proceedings and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. There can be no assurance that insurance policies we maintain to limit our liability for such losses will be adequate to protect us from all material expenses related to potential future claims for personal and property damage or that such levels of insurance will be available in the future at economical prices.    Our need to comply with comprehensive, complex and sometimes unpredictable government regulations may increase our costs and limit our revenue growth, which may result in reduced earnings.    Significant portions of our gathering, transportation, storage and distribution businesses are subject to state and federal regulation including regulation of the rates which we may assess our customers. The agencies that regulate our rates may prohibit us from realizing a level of return which we believe is appropriate. These restrictions may take the form of imputed revenue credits, cost disallowances (including purchased gas cost    13        recoveries) and/or expense deferrals. Additionally, we may be required to provide additional assistance to low income residential customers to help pay their bills without the ability to recover some or all of the additional assistance in rates.    We are subject to laws, regulations and other legal requirements enacted or adopted by federal, state and local, as well as foreign authorities relating to protection of the environment and health and safety matters, including those legal requirements that govern discharges of substances into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, the clean-up of contaminated sites, groundwater quality and availability, plant and wildlife protection, restoration of drilling properties after drilling is completed, pipeline safety and work practices related to employee health and safety. Complying with these requirements could have a significant effect on our costs of operations and competitive position. If we fail to comply with these requirements, even if caused by factors beyond our control, such failure could result in the assessment of civil or criminal penalties and damages against us.    The rates of federal, state and local taxes applicable to the industries in which we operate, including production taxes paid by Equitable Supply, which often fluctuate, could be increased by the various taxing authorities. In addition, the tax laws, rules and regulations that affect our business could change. Any such increase or change could adversely impact our cash flows and profitability.
