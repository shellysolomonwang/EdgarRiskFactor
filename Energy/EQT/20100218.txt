Item 1A. Risk Factors    Risks Relating to Our Business   In addition to the other information contained in this Form 10-K, the following risk factors should be considered in evaluating our business and future prospects. Please note that additional risks not presently known to us or that are currently considered immaterial may also have a negative impact on our business and operations. If any of the events or circumstances described below actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations could suffer and the trading price of our common stock could decline.   Natural gas price volatility may have an adverse effect on our revenue, profitability, future rate of growth and liquidity.    Our revenue, profitability, future rate of growth and liquidity depend upon the price for natural gas. The markets for natural gas are volatile and fluctuations in prices will affect our financial results. Natural gas prices are affected by a number of factors beyond our control, which include: weather conditions; the supply of and demand for natural gas; national and worldwide economic and political conditions; the price and availability of alternative fuels; the proximity to, and availability of capacity on, transportation facilities; and government regulations, such as regulation of natural gas transportation and price controls.    Lower natural gas prices may result in decreases in the revenue, margin and cash flow for each of our businesses, a reduction in the construction of new transportation capacity and downward adjustments to the value of our estimated proved reserves which may cause us to incur non-cash charges to earnings. A reduction in cash flow will reduce our funds available for capital expenditures and, correspondingly, our opportunities for growth. We are also exposed to the risk of non-performance by our hedge counterparties in the event that changes, positive or negative, in natural gas prices result in derivative contracts with a positive fair value.    Increases in natural gas prices may be accompanied by or result in increased well drilling costs, increased deferral of purchased gas costs for our distribution operations, increased production taxes, increased lease operating expenses, increased exposure to credit losses resulting from potential increases in uncollectible accounts receivable from our distribution customers, increased volatility in seasonal gas price spreads for our storage assets and increased customer conservation or conversion to alternative fuels. Significant price increases subject us to margin calls on our commodity price derivative contracts (hedging arrangements, including futures contracts, swap, collar and option agreements and exchange traded instruments) which would potentially require us to post significant amounts of cash collateral with our hedge counterparties. The cash collateral, which is interest-bearing, provided to our hedge counterparties is returned to us in whole or in part upon a reduction in forward market prices, depending on the amount of such reduction, or in whole upon settlement of the related hedged transaction. In addition, to the extent we have hedged our current production at prices below the current market price, we are unable to benefit fully from an increase in the price of natural gas.    Our need to comply with comprehensive, complex and sometimes unpredictable government regulations may increase our costs and limit our revenue growth, which may result in reduced earnings.    Our operations are regulated extensively at the federal, state and local levels. Laws, regulations and other legal requirements have increased the cost to plan, design, drill, install, operate and abandon wells, gathering systems, pipelines and distribution systems. Environment, health and safety legal requirements govern discharges of substances into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, the clean-up of contaminated sites, groundwater quality and availability, plant and wildlife protection, restoration of drilling properties after drilling is completed, pipeline safety and work practices related to employee health and safety. Compliance with the laws, regulations and other legal requirements applicable to our businesses may be costly. These requirements could subject us to liability for personal injuries, property damage and other damages. Our failure to comply with the laws, regulations and other legal requirements applicable to our businesses, even if as a result of factors beyond our control, may result in the suspension or termination of our operations and subject us to administrative, civil and criminal penalties and damages.     13      Table of Contents   The rates charged to customers by our gathering, transportation, storage and distribution businesses are, in many cases, subject to state or federal regulation. The agencies that regulate our rates may prohibit us from realizing a level of return which we believe is appropriate. These restrictions may take the form of imputed revenue credits, cost disallowances (including purchased gas cost recoveries) and/or expense deferrals. Additionally, we may be required to provide additional assistance to low income residential customers to help pay their bills without the ability to recover some or all of the additional assistance in rates.   Laws, regulations and other legal requirements are constantly changing and implementation of compliant processes in response to such changes could be costly and time consuming. For instance, the U.S. Congress and various states have been evaluating climate-related legislation and other regulatory initiatives that would restrict emissions of greenhouse gases, including methane (a primary component of natural gas) and carbon dioxide (a byproduct of burning natural gas). Such restrictions may result in additional compliance obligations with respect to, or taxes on, and the release, capture and use of greenhouse gases that could have an adverse effect on our operations. Changes to well fracturing or waste water regulations or existing legal requirements could also have a significant effect on our costs of operations and competitive position.    The rates of federal, state and local taxes applicable to the industries in which we operate, including production taxes paid by EQT Production, which often fluctuate, could be increased by the various taxing authorities. In addition, the tax laws, rules and regulations that affect our business, such as the imposition of a new severance tax (a tax on the extraction of natural resources) in states in which we produce gas, could change. Any such increase or change could adversely impact our cash flows and profitability.   Strategic determinations regarding the allocation of capital and other resources in the current economic environment are challenging and our failure to appropriately allocate capital and resources among our businesses may adversely affect our financial condition and reduce our growth rate.    In developing our 2010 business plan, we considered allocating capital and other resources to various aspects of our businesses including well-development (primarily drilling), reserve acquisitions, exploratory activity, midstream infrastructure, distribution infrastructure, corporate items and other alternatives. We also considered our likely sources of capital. Notwithstanding the determinations made in the development of our 2010 plan, business opportunities not previously identified periodically come to our attention, including possible acquisitions and dispositions. If we don’t optimize our capital investment and capital raising opportunities and the use of our other resources, our financial condition and growth rate may be adversely affected.    Global financial challenges may adversely affect our business and financial condition in ways that we currently cannot predict. Downgrades to our credit ratings could increase our costs of borrowing adversely affecting our business, results of operations and liquidity.   We rely upon access to both short-term bank and money markets and longer-term capital markets as sources of liquidity for any capital requirements not satisfied by the cash flow from operations. Challenges in the global financial system, including the capital markets, may adversely affect our business and our financial condition and we may face challenges if conditions in the financial markets do not improve. Our ability to access the capital markets may be restricted at a time when we desire, or need, to raise capital, which could have an impact on our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions. The economic situation could adversely affect the collectability of our trade receivables. Market conditions could cause our commodity hedging counterparties to be unable to perform their obligations or to seek bankruptcy protection. Continuing challenges in the economy could lead to reduced demand for natural gas which could have a negative impact on our revenues and our credit ratings.    Any downgrade of our credit ratings may increase the cost of borrowing or adversely affect our ability to raise capital through the issuance of debt or equity securities or other borrowing arrangements, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and liquidity. We cannot be sure that our current ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that our rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency. An increase in the level of our indebtedness in the future may result in a downgrade in the ratings that are assigned to our debt. Any downgrade in our ratings could result in an increase in our borrowing costs, which would diminish financial results.   14      Table of Contents   Our failure to develop or obtain, and maintain, the necessary infrastructure to successfully deliver gas to market may adversely affect our earnings, cash flows and results of operations.    Our delivery of gas depends upon the availability of adequate transportation infrastructure. The Company’s investment in midstream infrastructure is intended to address a lack of capacity on, and access to, existing gathering and transportation pipelines as well as processing adjacent to and curtailments on such pipelines. The lack of midstream infrastructure is particularly acute in the geographic area in which the Marcellus shale is being developed. Our infrastructure development and maintenance programs can involve significant risks, including those related to timing, cost overruns and operational efficiency, and these risks can be affected by the availability of capital, materials, and qualified contractors and work force, as well as weather conditions, gas price volatility, government approvals, title problems, geology, compliance by third parties with their contractual obligations to us and other factors. We also deliver to and are served by third party gas gathering, transportation, processing and storage facilities which are limited in number and geographically concentrated. An extended interruption of access to or service from these facilities could result in adverse consequences to us. In addition, some of our third party contracts may involve significant financial commitments on our part and may make us dependent upon others to get our produced natural gas to market.    We are subject to risks associated with the operation of our wells, pipelines and facilities.    Our business operations are subject to all of the inherent hazards and risks normally incidental to the production, transportation, storage and distribution of natural gas. These risks could result in substantial losses due to personal injury and/or loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment and pollution or other environmental damage. As a result, we are sometimes a defendant in legal proceedings and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. There can be no assurance that the insurance policies we maintain to limit our liability for such losses will be adequate to protect us from all material expenses related to potential future claims for personal injury and property damage or that such levels of insurance will be available in the future at economical prices or to cover all risks.   The amount and timing of actual future gas production is difficult to predict and may vary significantly from our estimates which may reduce our earnings.   Our future success depends upon our ability to develop additional gas reserves that are economically recoverable and to optimize existing well production, and our failure to do so may reduce our earnings. Our drilling and subsequent maintenance of wells can involve significant risks, including those related to timing, cost overruns and operational efficiency, and these risks can be affected by the availability of capital, leases, rigs and a qualified work force, as well as weather conditions, gas price volatility, government approvals, title problems, geology and other factors. Drilling for natural gas can be unprofitable, not only from dry wells, but from productive wells that do not produce sufficient revenues to return a profit. Additionally, a failure to effectively and efficiently operate existing wells may cause production volumes to fall short of our projections. Without continued successful development or acquisition activities, together with effective operation of existing wells, our reserves and revenues will decline as a result of our current reserves being depleted by production.   Our failure to assess production opportunities based on market conditions could negatively impact our long-term growth prospects for our production business.    Our goal of sustaining long-term growth for our production business is contingent upon our ability to identify production opportunities based on market conditions. Our decision to drill a prospect is subject to a number of factors which may alter our drilling schedule or our plans to drill at all. We may have difficulty drilling all of the wells before the lease term expires which could result in the loss of certain leasehold rights or we could drill wells in locations where we do not have the necessary infrastructure to deliver the gas to market. Successfully identifying production opportunities involves a high degree of business experience, knowledge and careful evaluation of potential opportunities, along with subjective judgments and assumptions which may prove to be incorrect. Our recent addition of exploration projects increases the risks inherent in our natural gas activities. Specifically, seismic data is subject to interpretation and may not accurately identify the presence of natural gas, which could adversely affect the results of our operations. Because we have a limited operating history in certain exploratory areas, our    15      Table of Contents   future operating results are difficult to forecast, and our failure to sustain high growth rates in the future could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.   See Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,” for further discussion regarding the Company’s exposure to market risks, including the risks associated with our use of derivative contracts to hedge commodity prices.
