Item 1A. Risk Factors”.   Seasonal Nature of Business   Generally, but not always, the demand for natural gas decreases during the summer months and increases during the winter months. Seasonal anomalies such as mild winters or hot summers sometimes lessen this fluctuation. In addition, pipelines, utilities, local distribution companies and industrial users utilize natural gas storage facilities and purchase some of their anticipated winter requirements during the summer. This can also lessen seasonal demand fluctuations.   Government Regulation   The oil and gas industry is subject to various types of regulation throughout the world. Legislation affecting the oil and gas industry has been pervasive and is under constant review for amendment or expansion. Pursuant to such legislation, numerous government agencies have issued extensive laws and regulations binding on the oil and gas industry and its individual members, some of which carry substantial penalties for failure to comply. Such laws and regulations have a significant impact on oil and gas exploration, production and marketing and midstream activities. These laws and regulations increase the cost of doing business and, consequently, affect profitability. Inasmuch as new legislation affecting the oil and gas industry is commonplace and existing laws and regulations are frequently amended or reinterpreted, we are unable to predict the future cost or impact of complying with such laws and regulations. However, we do not expect that any of these laws and regulations will affect our operations in a manner materially different than they would affect other oil and gas companies of similar size.   The following are significant areas of government control and regulation in the United States, Canada and international locations in which we operate.           United States Regulation    Exploration and Production. Our United States operations are subject to various types of regulation at the federal, state and local levels. Such regulation includes requiring permits for the drilling of wells; maintaining bonding requirements in order to drill or operate wells; implementing spill prevention plans; submitting notification and receiving permits relating to the presence, use and release of certain materials incidental to oil and gas operations; and regulating the location of wells, the method of drilling and casing wells, the use, transportation, storage and disposal of fluids and materials used in connection with drilling and production activities, surface usage and the restoration of properties upon which wells have been drilled, the plugging and abandoning of wells and the transportation of production. Our operations are also subject to various conservation regulations, including the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units, the number of wells which may be drilled in a unit, and the unitization or pooling of oil and gas properties. In this regard, some states allow the forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration while other states rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases, which may make it more difficult to develop oil and gas properties. In addition, state conservation laws establish maximum rates of production from oil and gas wells, generally limit the venting or flaring of gas, and impose certain requirements regarding the ratable purchase of production. The effect of these regulations is to limit the amounts of oil and gas we can produce from our wells and to limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill.   Certain oil and gas leases, including our offshore Gulf of Mexico leases, most of our leases in the San Juan Basin and many of our leases in southeast New Mexico, Montana and Wyoming, are granted by the federal government and administered by various federal agencies, including the Minerals Management Service of the Department of the Interior (“MMS”). Such leases require compliance with detailed federal regulations and orders which regulate, among other matters, drilling and operations on lands covered by these leases, and calculation and disbursement of royalty payments to the federal government. The MMS has been particularly active in recent years in evaluating and, in some cases, promulgating new rules and  9   Table of Contents  regulations regarding competitive lease bidding and royalty payment obligations for production from federal lands. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) also has jurisdiction over certain offshore activities pursuant to the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act.   Environmental and Occupational Regulations. Various federal, state and local laws and regulations concerning the discharge of incidental materials into the environment, the generation, storage, transportation and disposal of contaminants or otherwise relating to the protection of public health, natural resources, wildlife and the environment, affect our exploration, development, processing, and production operations and related costs. We are also subject to laws and regulations concerning occupational safety and health. We consider the costs of environmental protection and safety and health compliance necessary and manageable parts of our business. We maintain our own internal Environmental, Health and Safety Department. This department is responsible for instituting and maintaining an environmental and safety compliance program for Devon. The program includes field inspections of properties and internal assessments of our compliance procedures. We have been able to plan for and comply with new environmental and safety and health initiatives without materially altering our operating strategies.   We maintain levels of insurance customary in the industry to limit our financial exposure in the event of a substantial environmental claim resulting from sudden, unanticipated and accidental discharges of oil, salt water or other substances. However, 100% coverage is not maintained concerning any environmental claim, and no coverage is maintained with respect to any penalty or fine required to be paid because of violation of any federal, state or local law. We are committed to meeting our responsibilities to protect the environment wherever we operate and anticipate making increased expenditures of both a capital and expense nature as a result of the increasingly stringent laws relating to the protection of the environment. Our unreimbursed expenditures in 2005 concerning such matters were immaterial, but we cannot predict with any reasonable degree of certainty our future exposure concerning such matters.   We are subject to certain laws and regulations relating to environmental remediation activities associated with past operations, such as the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”) and similar state statutes. In response to claims associated with these activities, we recognize liabilities when reasonable estimates are possible. Such liabilities are primarily for estimated costs associated with remediation. We have not used discounting in determining our accrued liabilities for environmental remediation, and no material claims for possible recovery from third party insurers or other parties related to environmental costs have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements. We adjust the liabilities when new remediation responsibilities are discovered and probable costs become estimable, or when current remediation estimates must be adjusted to reflect new information.   Certain of our subsidiaries acquired in past mergers are involved in matters in which it has been alleged that such subsidiaries are potentially responsible parties (“PRPs”) under CERCLA or similar state legislation with respect to various waste disposal areas owned or operated by third parties. As of December 31, 2005, our consolidated balance sheet included $4 million of non-current accrued liabilities, reflected in “Other liabilities,” related to these and other environmental remediation liabilities. We do not currently believe there is a reasonable possibility of incurring additional material costs in excess of the existing liabilities recognized for such environmental remediation activities. With respect to the sites in which our subsidiaries are PRPs, our conclusion is based in large part on our (i) participation in consent decrees with both other PRPs and the Environmental Protection Agency, which provide for performing the scope of work required for remediation and contain covenants not to sue as protection to the PRPs, (ii) participation in groups as a de minimis PRP, and (iii) the availability of other defenses to liability. As a result, our monetary exposure is not expected to be material.    Canadian Regulations   Exploration and Production. Our Canadian operations are subject to federal and provincial governmental regulations. Such regulations include requiring licenses for the drilling of wells, regulating the location of wells and the method and ability to produce wells, surface usage and the restoration of land  10   Table of Contents  upon which wells have been drilled, the plugging and abandoning of wells and the transportation of production from wells. Our Canadian operations are also subject to various conservation regulations, including the regulation of the size of spacing units, the number of wells which may be drilled in a unit, the unitization or pooling of oil and gas properties, the rate of production allowable from oil and gas wells, and the ability to produce oil and gas. In Canada, the effect of such regulation is to limit the amounts of oil and gas we can produce from our wells and to limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill.   Royalties and Incentives. Each province and the federal government of Canada have legislation and regulations governing land tenure, royalties, production rates and taxes, environmental protection and other matters under their respective jurisdictions. The royalty regime is a significant factor in the profitability of oil and natural gas production. Royalties payable on production from lands other than Crown lands are determined by negotiations between the parties. Crown royalties are determined by government regulation and are generally calculated as a percentage of the value of the gross production with the royalty rate dependent in part upon prescribed reference prices, well productivity, geographical location, field discovery date and the type and quality of the petroleum product produced. From time to time, the governments of Canada, Alberta, British Columbia and Saskatchewan have also established incentive programs such as royalty rate reductions, royalty holidays and tax credits for the purpose of encouraging oil and natural gas exploration or enhanced recovery projects. These incentives generally have the effect of increasing our cash flow.   Pricing and Marketing. The price of oil, natural gas and NGLs sold is determined by negotiation between buyers and sellers. An order from the National Energy Board (“NEB”) is required for oil exports from Canada. Any oil export to be made pursuant to an export contract of longer than one year, in the case of light crude, and two years, in the case of heavy crude, requires an exporter to obtain an export license from the NEB. The issue of such a license requires the approval of the Government of Canada. Natural gas exported from Canada is also subject to similar regulation by the NEB. Natural gas exports for a term of less than two years, or for a term of two to twenty years in quantities of not more than 20,000 Mcf per day, must be made pursuant to an NEB order. Any natural gas exports to be made pursuant to a contract of larger duration (to a maximum of 25 years) or in larger quantities require an exporter to obtain a license from the NEB, which requires the approval of the Government of Canada. Exporters are free to negotiate prices and other terms with purchasers, provided that the export contracts meet certain criteria prescribed by the NEB. The governments of Alberta, British Columbia and Saskatchewan also regulate the volume of natural gas which may be removed from those provinces for consumption elsewhere based on such factors as reserve availability, transportation arrangements and market considerations.   Environmental Regulation. The oil and natural gas industry is subject to environmental regulation pursuant to local, provincial and federal legislation. Environmental legislation provides for restrictions and prohibitions on releases or emissions of various substances produced or utilized in association with certain oil and gas industry operations. In addition, legislation requires that well and facility sites be monitored, abandoned and reclaimed to the satisfaction of provincial authorities. A breach of such legislation may result in the imposition of fines and penalties. We are committed to meeting our responsibilities to protect the environment wherever we operate and anticipate making increased expenditures of both a capital and expense nature as a result of the increasingly stringent laws relating to the protection of the environment. Our unreimbursed expenditures in 2005 concerning such matters were immaterial, but we cannot predict with any reasonable degree of certainty our future exposure concerning such matters.   The North American Free Trade Agreement. The North American Free Trade Agreement (“NAFTA”) grants Canada the freedom to determine whether exports to the United States or Mexico will be allowed. In making this determination, Canada must ensure that any export restrictions do not (i) reduce the proportion of energy exported relative to the supply of the energy resource; (ii) impose an export price higher than the domestic price; or (iii) disrupt normal channels of supply. All parties to NAFTA are also prohibited from imposing minimum export or import price requirements.  11   Table of Contents  Kyoto Protocol. The Kyoto Protocol calls for Canada to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions to 6 percent below 1990 levels during the period between 2008 and 2012. The protocol is expected to affect the operation of all industries in Canada, including the oil and gas industry. As details of the implementation of emissions reduction legislation related to this protocol have yet to be finalized, the effect on our operations cannot be determined at this time.   Investment Canada Act. The Investment Canada Act requires Government of Canada approval, in certain cases, of the acquisition of control of a Canadian business by an entity that is not controlled by Canadians. In certain circumstances, the acquisition of natural resource properties may be considered to be a transaction requiring such approval.           International Regulations    Exploration and Production. Our oil and gas concessions and operating licenses or permits are granted by host governments and administered by various foreign government agencies. Such foreign governments require compliance with detailed regulations and orders which regulate, among other matters, seismic, drilling and production operations on areas covered by concessions and permits and calculation and disbursement of royalty payments, taxes and minimum investments to the government.   Regulations include requiring permits for acquiring seismic data; drilling wells; maintaining bonding requirements in order to drill or operate wells; implementing spill prevention plans; submitting notification and receiving permits relating to the presence, use and release of certain materials incidental to oil and gas operations; and regulating the location of wells, the method of drilling and casing wells, the use, transportation, storage and disposal of fluids and materials used in connection with drilling and production activities, surface usage and the restoration of properties upon which wells have been drilled, the plugging and abandoning of wells and the transporting of production. Our operations are also subject to regulations which may limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill.   Production Sharing Contracts. Many of our international licenses are governed by Production Sharing Contracts (“PSCs”) between the concessionaires and the granting government agency. PSCs are contracts that define and regulate the framework for investments, revenue sharing, and taxation of mineral interests in foreign countries. Unlike most domestic leases, PSCs have defined production terms and time limits of generally 30 years. Many PSCs allow for recovery of investments including carried government percentages. PSCs generally contain sliding scale revenue sharing provisions. For example, at either higher production rates or higher cumulative rates of return, PSCs allow governments to generally retain higher fractions of revenue.   Environmental Regulations. Various government laws and regulations concerning the discharge of incidental materials into the environment, the generation, storage, transportation and disposal of waste or otherwise relating to the protection of public health, natural resources, wildlife and the environment, affect our exploration, development, processing and production operations and related costs. In general, this consists of preparing Environmental Impact Assessments in order to receive required environmental permits to conduct seismic acquisition, drilling or construction activities. Such regulations also typically include requirements to develop emergency response plans, waste management plans, environmental protection plans and spill contingency plans. In some countries, the application of worldwide standards, such as ISO 14000 governing Environmental Management Systems, are required to be implemented for international oil and gas operations. Additionally, the Kyoto Protocol will have requirements similar to those for Canada for the oil and gas industry in Azerbaijan, Brazil, China, Egypt, Equatorial Guinea, Nigeria and Russia. As details of the implementation of emissions reduction initiatives related to this protocol have yet to be announced, the effect on our international operations, if any, cannot be determined at this time.   Employees   As of December 31, 2005, our staff consisted of 4,075 full-time employees. We believe we have good labor relations with our employees.  12   Table of Contents      Item 1A. Risk Factors   Our business activities, and the oil and gas industry in general, are subject to a variety of risks. Although we have a diversified asset base, a strong balance sheet and a history of generating sufficient cash to fund capital expenditure and investment programs and to pay dividends, if any of the following risk factors should occur, our profitability, financial condition and/or liquidity could be materially impacted. As a result, holders of our securities could lose part or all of their investment in Devon.   Oil, Natural Gas and NGL Prices are Volatile   Our financial results are highly dependent on the prices of and demand for oil, natural gas and NGLs. A significant downward movement of the prices for these commodities could have a material adverse effect on our estimated proved reserves, revenues and operating cash flows. Such a downward price movement could also have a material adverse effect on our profitability, the carrying value of our oil and gas properties and future growth. Historically, prices have been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile in the future due to numerous factors beyond our control. These factors include, but are not limited to:            •   consumer demand for oil, natural gas and NGLs;         •   conservation efforts;         •   OPEC production restraints;         •   weather;         •   regional market pricing differences;         •   differing quality of oil produced (i.e., sweet crude versus heavy or sour crude) and Btu content of gas produced;         •   the level of imports and exports of oil, natural gas and NGLs;         •   the price and availability of alternative fuels;         •   the overall economic environment; and         •   governmental regulations and taxes.    Estimates of Oil, Natural Gas and NGL Reserves are Uncertain   The process of estimating oil, gas and NGL reserves is complex and requires significant judgment in the evaluation of available geological, engineering and economic data for each reservoir, particularly for new discoveries. Because of the high degree of judgment involved, different reserve engineers may develop different estimates of reserve quantities and related revenue based on the same data. In addition, the reserve estimates for a given reservoir may change substantially over time as a result of several factors including additional development activity, the viability of production under varying economic conditions and variations in production levels and associated costs. Consequently, material revisions to existing reserve estimates may occur as a result of changes in any of these factors. Such revisions to proved reserves could have a material adverse effect on our estimates of future net revenue, as well as our financial condition and profitability. Additional discussion of our policies regarding estimating and recording reserves is described in “Item 2. Properties — Proved Reserves and Estimated Future Net Revenue”.   Discoveries or Acquisitions of Additional Reserves are Needed to Avoid a Material Decline in Reserves and Production   The production rate from oil and gas properties generally declines as reserves are depleted, while related per unit production costs generally increase due to decreasing reservoir pressures and other factors. Therefore, our estimated proved reserves and future oil, gas and NGL production will decline materially as reserves are produced unless we conduct successful exploration and development activities or, through engineering studies, identify additional producing zones in existing wells, secondary recovery reserves or  13   Table of Contents  tertiary recovery reserves, or acquire additional properties containing proved reserves. Consequently, our future oil, gas and NGL production and related per unit production costs are highly dependent upon our level of success in finding or acquiring additional reserves.   Future Exploration and Drilling Results are Uncertain and Involve Substantial Costs   Substantial costs are often required to locate and acquire properties and drill exploratory wells. Such activities are subject to numerous risks, including the risk that we will not encounter commercially productive oil or gas reservoirs. The costs of drilling and completing wells are often uncertain. In addition, oil and gas properties can become damaged or drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors including, but not limited to:            •   unexpected drilling conditions;         •   pressure or irregularities in reservoir formations;         •   equipment failures or accidents;         •   fires, explosions, blow-outs and surface cratering;         •   marine risks such as capsizing, collisions and hurricanes;         •   other adverse weather conditions;         •   lack of access to pipelines or other methods of transportation;         •   environmental hazards or liabilities; and         •   shortages or delays in the delivery of equipment.    A significant occurrence of one of these factors could result in a partial or total loss of our investment in a particular property. In addition, drilling activities may not be successful in establishing proved reserves. Such a failure could have an adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition. While both exploratory and developmental drilling activities involve these risks, exploratory drilling involves greater risks of dry holes or failure to find commercial quantities of hydrocarbons. We are currently performing exploratory drilling activities in certain international countries. We have been granted drilling concessions in these countries that require commitments on our behalf to incur significant capital expenditures. Even if future drilling activities are unsuccessful in establishing proved reserves, we will likely be required to fulfill our commitments to make such capital expenditures.   Industry Competition For Leases, Materials, People and Capital Can Be Significant   Strong competition exists in all sectors of the oil and gas industry. We compete with major integrated and other independent oil and gas companies for the acquisition of oil and gas leases and properties. We also compete for the equipment and personnel required to explore, develop and operate properties. Competition is also prevalent in the marketing of oil, gas and NGLs. Higher recent commodity prices have increased the costs of properties available for acquisition, and there are a greater number of companies with the financial resources to pursue acquisition opportunities. Certain of our competitors have financial and other resources substantially larger than ours, and they have also established strategic long-term positions and maintain strong governmental relationships in countries in which we may seek new entry. As a consequence, we may be at a competitive disadvantage in bidding for drilling rights. In addition, many of our larger competitors may have a competitive advantage when responding to factors that affect demand for oil and natural gas production, such as changing worldwide prices and levels of production, the cost and availability of alternative fuels and the application of government regulations.   International Operations Have Uncertain Political, Economic and Other Risks   We have international operations in Angola, Azerbaijan, Brazil, China, Cote d’Ivoire, Egypt, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Ghana, Indonesia, Nigeria and the Russian Republic of Tatarstan. As a result,  14   Table of Contents  we face political and economic risks and other uncertainties that are less prevalent for our operations in North America. Such factors include, but are not limited to:            •   general strikes and civil unrest;         •   the risk of war, acts of terrorism, expropriation, forced renegotiation or modification of existing contracts;         •   import and export regulations;         •   taxation policies, including royalty and tax increases and retroactive tax claims, and investment restrictions;         •   transportation regulations and tariffs;         •   exchange controls, currency fluctuations, devaluation or other activities that limit or disrupt markets and restrict payments or the movement of funds;         •   laws and policies of the United States affecting foreign trade, including trade sanctions;         •   the possibility of being subject to exclusive jurisdiction of foreign courts in connection with legal disputes relating to licenses to operate and concession rights in countries where we currently operate;         •   the possible inability to subject foreign persons to the jurisdiction of courts in the United States; and         •   difficulties in enforcing our rights against a governmental agency because of the doctrine of sovereign immunity and foreign sovereignty over international operations.    Foreign countries have occasionally asserted rights to oil and gas properties through border disputes. If a country claims superior rights to oil and gas leases or concessions granted to us by another country, our interests could decrease in value or be lost. Even our smaller international assets may affect our overall business and results of operations by distracting management’s attention from our more significant assets. Various regions of the world have a history of political and economic instability. This instability could result in new governments or the adoption of new policies that might result in a substantially more hostile attitude toward foreign investment. In an extreme case, such a change could result in termination of contract rights and expropriation of foreign-owned assets. This could adversely affect our interests and our future profitability.   The impact that future terrorist attacks or regional hostilities may have on the oil and gas industry in general, and on our operations in particular, is not known at this time. Uncertainty surrounding military strikes or a sustained military campaign may affect operations in unpredictable ways, including disruptions of fuel supplies and markets, particularly oil, and the possibility that infrastructure facilities, including pipelines, production facilities, processing plants and refineries, could be direct targets of, or indirect casualties of, an act of terror or war. We may be required to incur significant costs in the future to safeguard our assets against terrorist activities.   Government Laws and Regulations Can Change   Our operations are subject to federal laws and regulations in the United States, Canada and the other international countries in which we operate. In addition, we are also subject to the laws and regulations of various states, provinces and local governments. Pursuant to such legislation, numerous government departments and agencies have issued extensive rules and regulations binding on the oil and gas industry and its individual members, some of which carry substantial penalties for failure to comply. Changes in such legislation have affected, and at times in the future could affect, our future operations. Political developments can restrict production levels, enact price controls, change environmental protection requirements, and increase taxes, royalties and other amounts payable to governments or governmental agencies. Although we are unable to predict changes to existing laws and regulations, such changes could  15   Table of Contents  significantly impact our profitability. While such legislation can change at any time in the future, those laws and regulations outside North America to which we are subject generally include greater risk of unforeseen change.   Environmental Matters and Costs Can Be Significant   As an owner or lessee and operator of oil and gas properties, we are subject to various federal, provincial, state, local and international laws and regulations relating to discharge of materials into, and protection of, the environment. These laws and regulations may, among other things, impose liability on us for the cost of pollution clean-up resulting from our operations in affected areas.   Insurance Does Not Cover All Risks   Exploration, development, production and processing of oil, natural gas and NGLs can be hazardous and involve unforeseen occurrences such as hurricanes, blowouts, cratering, fires and loss of well control. These occurrences can result in damage to or destruction of wells or production facilities, injury to persons, loss of life, or damage to property or the environment. We maintain insurance against certain losses or liabilities in accordance with customary industry practices and in amounts that management believes to be prudent. However, insurance against all operational risks is not available to us.       Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments
