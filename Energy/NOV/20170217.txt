ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS  You should carefully consider the risks described below, in addition to other information contained or incorporated by reference herein. Realization of any of the following risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.  We are dependent upon the level of activity in the oil and gas industry, which is volatile and has caused, and may cause future, fluctuations in our operating results.  The oil and gas industry historically has experienced significant volatility. Demand for our products and services depends primarily upon the number of oil rigs in operation, the number of oil and gas wells being drilled, the depth and drilling conditions of these wells, the volume of production, the number of well completions, capital expenditures of other oilfield service companies and the level of workover activity. Drilling and workover activity can fluctuate significantly in a short period, particularly in the United States and Canada. The willingness of oil and gas operators to make capital expenditures to explore for and produce oil and natural gas and the willingness of oilfield service companies to invest in capital equipment will continue to be influenced by numerous factors over which we have no control, including the:        •   current and anticipated future prices for oil and natural gas;        •   volatility of prices for oil and natural gas;        •   ability or willingness of the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (“OPEC”) to maintain or influence price stability through voluntary production limits;        •   level of production by non-OPEC countries;        •   level of excess production capacity;        •   cost of exploring for and producing oil and gas;        •   level of drilling activity and drilling rig dayrates;        •   worldwide economic activity and associated demand for oil and gas;        •   availability and access to potential hydrocarbon resources;        •   national government political requirements;        •   fluctuations in political conditions in the United States and abroad;        •   currency exchange rate fluctuations and devaluations;        •   development of alternate energy sources; and,        •   environmental regulations.  The significant oil and gas industry downturn that began in the second half of 2014 resulted in reduced demand for oilfield services, which has had, and may continue to have, a significant adverse impact on our financial results. Expectations for future oil and gas prices cause many shifts in the strategies and expenditure levels of oil and gas companies, drilling contractors, and other service companies, particularly with respect to decisions to purchase major capital equipment of the type we manufacture. Although oil and gas prices, which are determined by the marketplace, have increased in recent months, prices may remain below a range that is acceptable to our customers, which could continue the reduced demand for our products and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  This volatility in oil and gas prices and in the oil and gas industry has caused fluctuations in our quarterly operating results in the past. We cannot assure you that we will realize earnings growth or that earnings in any particular quarter will not fall short of either a prior fiscal quarter or investors’ expectations. There are risks associated with certain contracts for our equipment.  As of December 31, 2016, we had a backlog of capital equipment to be manufactured, assembled, tested and delivered by Rig Systems and Completion & Production Solutions in the amount of $2.5 billion and $0.8 billion, respectively. The following factors, in addition to others not listed, could reduce our margins on these contracts, adversely impact completion of these contracts, adversely affect our position in the market or subject us to contractual penalties:        •   financial challenges for consumers of our capital equipment;        •   credit market conditions for consumers of our capital equipment;    15    Table of Contents     •   our failure to adequately estimate costs for making this equipment;        •   our inability to deliver equipment that meets contracted technical requirements;        •   our inability to maintain our quality standards during the design and manufacturing process;        •   our inability to secure parts made by third party vendors at reasonable costs and within required timeframes;        •   unexpected increases in the costs of raw materials;        •   our inability to manage unexpected delays due to weather, shipyard access, labor shortages or other factors beyond our control; and,        •   the imposition of tarrifs or duties between countries, which could materially affect our global supply chain.  The Company’s existing contracts for rig equipment generally carry significant down payment and progress billing terms favorable to the ultimate completion of these projects and the majority do not allow customers to cancel projects for convenience. However, unfavorable market conditions or financial difficulties experienced by our customers may result in cancellation of contracts or the delay or abandonment of projects. Any such developments could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.  Competition in our industry, including the introduction of new products and technologies by our competitors, as well as the expiration of the intellectual property rights protecting our products and technologies, could ultimately lead to lower revenue and earnings.  The oilfield products and services industry is highly competitive. We compete with national, regional and foreign competitors in each of our current major product lines. Certain of these competitors may have greater financial, technical, manufacturing and marketing resources than us, and may be in a better competitive position. The following can each affect our revenue and earnings:        •   price changes;        •   improvements in the availability and delivery of products and services by our competitors;        •   the introduction of new products and technologies by our competitors; and,        •   the expiration of intellectual property rights protecting our products and technologies.  We are a leader in the development of new technology and equipment to enhance the safety and productivity of drilling and well servicing processes. Our revenues and operating results have been dependent, in part, upon the successful introduction of new or improved products. Through our internal development programs and acquisitions, we have assembled an extensive array of technologies protected by a substantial number of trade and service marks, patents, trade secrets, and other proprietary rights, some of which expire in the near future. The expiration of these rights could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Furthermore, while the Company stresses the importance of its research and development programs, the technical challenges and market uncertainties associated with the development and successful introduction of new products are such that there can be no assurance that the Company will realize future revenue from new products.  In addition, certain foreign jurisdictions and government-owned petroleum companies located in some of the countries in which we operate have adopted policies or regulations which may give local nationals in these countries competitive advantages. Actions taken by our competitors and changes in local policies, preferences or regulations could impact our ability to compete in certain markets and adversely affect our financial results.  There are risks associated with our presence in the U.S. and international markets, including political or economic instability, tax, potential changes to tariffs and trade disputes, currency restrictions, and trade and economic sanctions.  Approximately 75% of our revenues in 2016 were derived from operations outside the United States (based on revenue destination). Our foreign operations include significant operations in Argentina, Canada, Brazil, Europe, the Middle East, China, Africa, Nigeria, Southeast Asia, Russia, Latin America and other international markets. Our revenues and operations are subject to the risks normally associated with conducting business in foreign countries, including uncertain political and economic environments, which may limit or disrupt markets, restrict the movement of funds or result in the deprivation of contract rights or the taking of property without fair compensation. Government-owned petroleum companies located in some of the countries in which we operate have adopted policies, or are subject to governmental policies, giving preference to the purchase of goods and services from companies that are majority-owned by local nationals. As a result of these policies, we may rely on joint ventures, license arrangements and other business combinations with local nationals in these countries. In addition, political considerations may disrupt the commercial relationships between us and government-owned petroleum companies or oilfield service companies.    16    Table of Contents We manufacture and deliver products and provide services throughout the world. These operations involve complex, international supply chains. Our supply of materials for manufacturing and our channels to market involve import and export of materials and products to facilities and customers. The imposition of tariffs, retaliatory trade disputes, anti-dumping laws and regulations and other such trade restrictions could materially increase our costs, reduce sales, adversely impact our margins or completely restrict our ability to conduct business in certain markets.  Our operations outside the United States could also expose us to trade and economic sanctions or other restrictions imposed by the United States as well as non-U.S. Governmental Regulatory Authorities. The U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”), the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, other U.S. federal agencies and foreign governmental authorities have a broad range of civil and criminal penalties they may seek to impose against corporations and individuals for violations of trading sanctions laws, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”), other federal statutes, and foreign anti-bribery, anti-corruption and trade laws. Under U.S. trading sanctions laws, the government authorities may seek to impose modifications to business practices, including cessation of business activities in sanctioned countries, and modifications to compliance programs, which may increase compliance costs. If any of the risks described above materialize, it could adversely impact our operating results and financial condition.  Our ability to comply with the FCPA and foreign anti-bribery laws is dependent on the success of our ongoing compliance program, including our ability to continue to supervise, train and retain competent employees. Our compliance program also depends on the efforts of our employees to comply with applicable law. We could be subject to sanctions and civil and criminal prosecution as well as fines and penalties in the event of a finding of a violation of the FCPA or other anti-corruption laws by us or any of our employees. Compliance with, and changes in, laws could be costly and could affect operating results. In addition, government disruptions could negatively impact our ability to conduct our business.  Further, in some instances, direct or indirect consumers of our products and services, entities providing financing for purchases of our products and services or members of the supply chain for our products and services may become involved in governmental investigations, internal investigations, political or other enforcement matters. In such circumstances, such investigations may adversely impact the ability of consumers of our products, entities providing financial support to such consumers or entities in the supply chain to timely perform their business plans or to timely perform under agreements with us.  We have operations in the U.S. and in approximately 65 countries that can be impacted by changes in the legal and business environments in which we operate, including new legislation, new regulations, new policies, investigations and legal proceedings and new interpretations of existing legal rules and regulations, export control laws or exchange control laws, additional restrictions on doing business in countries subject to sanctions, and changes in laws in countries where we operate or intend to operate all could adversely impact our business.  We are subject to audits and imposition of taxation by different tax authorities internationally. The occurrence of audits may increase depending on a variety of factors including: the level of enforcement, political circumstance, and potential for revenue generation. Such factors are not within our control. Further, although there are international tax treaties designed to minimize the risk of double taxation, or inconsistent treatment by taxing authorities, the potential still exists for inconsistent treatment by multiple jurisdictions. As the result of such audits, taxes could be imposed that result in a material adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition.  Customers (typically drillship owners or drilling contractors) of our shipyard customers have sought and may in the future seek to suspend, delay or cancel their contracts or payments due to such shipyards. As a result, our shipyard customers have sought and may in the future seek to suspend, delay or cancel deliveries of our drilling equipment packages. To the extent our shipyard customers and their customers become engaged in disputes or litigation related to any such suspensions, delays or cancellations, we may also become involved, either directly or indirectly, in such disputes or litigation, as we enforce the terms of our contracts with our shipyard customers. While we manage equipment deliveries and collection of payment to achieve milestone payments that mitigate our financial risk, such delays, suspensions, attempted cancellations, breaches of contract or other similar circumstances, could adversely affect our operating results and could reduce our backlog.  Sanctions imposed by the United States, European Union and other countries could adversely impact our business activities in or related to Russia and certain Russian companies, including prohibitions of certain sales of goods and services, delays in executing construction or manufacturing projects, credit risk and adverse impacts due to currency fluctuations. To date, we have not identified any material adverse financial impact to our business from these sanctions. Future trade regulations or sanctions, however, could result in adverse impacts on our operating results and financial condition.    17    Table of Contents The results of our operations are subject to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates.  We earn revenues, pay expenses, purchase assets and incur liabilities in countries using currencies other than the U.S. dollar, including, but not limited to, the Canadian dollar, the Euro, the British pound sterling, the Norwegian krone and the South Korean won. Approximately 75% of our 2016 revenue was derived from sales outside the United States. Because our Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in U.S. dollars, we must translate revenues and expenses into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period. Thus, increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar against other currencies in which our operations are conducted will affect our revenue and operating income. Because of the geographic diversity of our operations, weaknesses in some currencies might be offset by strengths in others over time. We use derivative financial instruments to mitigate our net exposure to currency exchange fluctuations. We had forward contracts with a notional amount of $2,219 million (with a fair value of a net liability of $15 million) as of December 31, 2016, to reduce the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements. We are also subject to risks that the counterparties to these contracts fail to meet the terms of our foreign currency contracts. We cannot assure you that fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates would not affect our financial results.  An impairment of goodwill or other indefinite lived intangible assets could reduce our earnings.  The Company has approximately $6.1 billion of goodwill and $0.4 billion of other intangible assets with indefinite lives as of December 31, 2016. Generally accepted accounting principles require the Company to test goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or whenever events or circumstances indicate they might be impaired. Events or circumstances which could indicate a potential impairment include (but are not limited to) a significant sustained reduction in worldwide oil and gas prices or drilling; a significant sustained reduction in profitability or cash flow of oil and gas companies or drilling contractors; a significant sustained reduction in capital investment by other oilfield service companies; or a significant increase in worldwide inventories of oil or gas. The timing and magnitude of any goodwill impairment charge, which could be material, would depend on the timing and severity of the event or events triggering the charge and would require a high degree of management judgment. If we were to determine that any of our remaining balance of goodwill or other indefinite lived intangible assets was impaired, we would record an immediate charge to earnings with a corresponding reduction in stockholders’ equity; resulting in a possible increase in balance sheet leverage as measured by debt to total capitalization.  In the third quarter of 2016, the Company impaired $972 million of goodwill. See additional discussion on “Goodwill and Other Indefinite – Lived Intangible Assets” in Critical Accounting Estimates of Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”  We could be adversely affected if we fail to comply with any of the numerous federal, state and local laws, regulations and policies that govern environmental protection, zoning and other matters applicable to our businesses.  Our businesses are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws, regulations and policies governing environmental protection, zoning and other matters. These laws and regulations have changed frequently in the past and it is reasonable to expect additional changes in the future. If existing regulatory requirements change, we may be required to make significant unanticipated capital and operating expenditures. We cannot assure you that our operations will continue to comply with future laws and regulations. Governmental authorities may seek to impose fines and penalties on us or to revoke or deny the issuance or renewal of operating permits for failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations. Under these circumstances, we might be required to reduce or cease operations or conduct site remediation or other corrective action which could adversely impact our operations and financial condition.  Our businesses expose us to potential environmental, product or personal injury liability.  Our businesses expose us to the risk that harmful substances may escape into the environment or a product could fail to perform or cause personal injury, which could result in:        •   personal injury or loss of life;        •   severe damage to or destruction of property; or,        •   environmental damage and suspension of operations.  Our current and past activities, as well as the activities of our former divisions and subsidiaries, could result in our facing substantial environmental, regulatory and other litigation and liabilities. These could include the costs of cleanup of contaminated sites and site closure obligations. These liabilities could also be imposed on the basis of one or more of the following theories:        •   negligence;        •   strict liability;    18    Table of Contents     •   breach of contract with customers; or,        •   as a result of our contractual agreement to indemnify our customers in the normal course of business, which is normally the case.  We may not have adequate insurance for potential environmental, product or personal injury liabilities.  While we maintain liability insurance, this insurance is subject to coverage limits. In addition, certain policies do not provide coverage for damages resulting from environmental contamination or may exclude coverage for other reasons. We face the following risks with respect to our insurance coverage:        •   we may not be able to continue to obtain insurance on commercially reasonable terms;        •   we may be faced with types of liabilities that will not be covered by our insurance;        •   our insurance carriers may not be able to meet their obligations under the policies; or,        •   the dollar amount of any liabilities may exceed our policy limits.  Even a partially uninsured claim, if successful and of significant size, could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements.  The adoption of climate change legislation, restrictions on emissions of greenhouse gases, or other environmental regulations could increase our operating costs or reduce demand for our products.  Environmental advocacy groups and regulatory agencies in the United States and other countries have been focusing considerable attention on the emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases and their potential role in climate change. The adoption of laws and regulations to implement controls of greenhouse gases, including the imposition of fees or taxes, could adversely impact our operations and financial condition. The U.S. Congress and other governments routinely consider legislation to control and reduce emissions of greenhouse gasses and other climate change related legislation, which could require significant reductions in emissions from oil and gas related operations. Additionally, recent concerns regarding the potential impact of hydraulic stimulation, or “fracking”, activities have resulted in government officials promulgating regulations to impose certain operational restrictions and disclosure requirements on oil and gas companies. Changes in the legal and regulatory environment could reduce oil and natural gas drilling activity and result in a corresponding decline in the demand for our products and services, which could adversely impact our operating results and financial condition.  Our information systems may experience an interruption or breach in security.  We rely heavily on information systems to conduct our business. Any failure, interruption or breach in security of our information systems could result in failures or disruptions in our customer relationship management, general ledger systems and other systems. While we have policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the failure, interruption or security breach of our information systems, there can be no assurance that any such failures, interruptions or security breaches will not occur or, if they do occur, that any breach or interruption will be sufficiently limited. The occurrence of any failures, interruptions or security breaches of our information systems could damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.  Local content requirements imposed in certain jurisdictions may increase the complexity of our operations and impact the demand for our services.  A growing number of nations are requiring equipment providers and contractors to meet local content requirements or other local standards. Our ability to work in certain jurisdictions is sometimes subject to our ability to successfully negotiate and agree upon acceptable joint venture agreements. The failure to reach acceptable agreements could adversely impact the Company’s operations in certain countries. Additionally, we may share control of joint ventures with unaffiliated third parties. Differences in views, and disagreements, among joint venture parties may result in delayed decision making and disputes on important issues. In some instances, we could suffer a material adverse effect to the results of our joint ventures and our consolidated results of operations.  Our ability to hire and retain qualified personnel at competitive cost could materially affect our operations and growth potential.  Many of the products we sell, and related services that we provide, are complex and technologically advanced, which enable them to perform in challenging conditions. Our ability to succeed is, in part, dependent on our success in attracting and retaining qualified personnel to provide service and to design, manufacture, use, install and commission our products. A significant increase in wages paid by competitors, both within and outside the energy industry, for such highly skilled personnel could result in insufficient availability of skilled labor or increase our labor costs, or both. If the supply of skilled labor is constrained or our costs increase, our margins could decrease and our growth potential could be impaired.    19    Table of Contents We have expanded our businesses through acquisitions and intend to maintain a growth strategy.  We have expanded and grown our businesses through acquisitions and continue to pursue a growth strategy but we cannot assure you that attractive acquisitions will be available to us at reasonable prices or at all. In addition, we cannot assure you that we will successfully integrate the operations and assets of any acquired business with our own or that our management will be able to manage effectively any new lines of business. Any inability on the part of management to integrate and manage acquired businesses and their assumed liabilities could adversely affect our business and financial performance. In addition, we may need to incur substantial indebtedness to finance future acquisitions. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain this financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. Future acquisitions may result in increased depreciation and amortization expense, increased interest expense, increased financial leverage or decreased operating income for the Company, any of which could cause our business to suffer.    20    Table of Contents GLOSSARY OF OILFIELD TERMS             (Sources: Company management; “A Dictionary for the Petroleum Industry,” The University of Texas at Austin, 2001.)     API   Abbr: American Petroleum Institute     Annular Blowout Preventer   A large valve, usually installed above the ram blowout preventers, that forms a seal in the annular space between the pipe and the wellbore or, if no pipe is present, in the wellbore itself.     Annulus   The open space around pipe in a wellbore through which fluids may pass.     Automatic Pipe Handling Systems (Automatic Pipe Racker)   A device used on a drilling rig to automatically remove and insert drill stem components from and into the hole. It replaces the need for a person to be in the derrick or mast when tripping pipe into or out of the hole.     Automatic Roughneck   A large, self-contained pipe-handling machine used by drilling crew members to make up and break out tubulars. The device combines a spinning wrench, torque wrench, and backup wrenches.     Beam pump   Surface pump that raise and lowers sucker rods continually, so as to operate a downhole pump.     Bit   The cutting or boring element used in drilling oil and gas wells. The bit consists of a cutting element and a circulating element. The cutting element is steel teeth, tungsten carbide buttons, industrial diamonds, or polycrystalline diamonds (“PDCs”). These teeth, buttons, or diamonds penetrate and gouge or scrape the formation to remove it. The circulating element permits the passage of drilling fluid and utilizes the hydraulic force of the fluid stream to improve drilling rates. In rotary drilling, several drill collars are joined to the bottom end of the drill pipe column, and the bit is attached to the end of the drill collars. Drill collars provide weight on the bit to keep it in firm contact with the bottom of the hole.      Blowout   An uncontrolled flow of gas, oil or other well fluids into the atmosphere. A blowout, or gusher, occurs when formation pressure exceeds the pressure applied to it by the column of drilling fluid. A kick warns of an impending blowout.     Blowout Preventer (BOP)   Series of valves installed at the wellhead while drilling to prevent the escape of pressurized fluids.     Blowout Preventer (BOP) Stack   The assembly of well-control equipment including preventers, spools, valves, and nipples connected to the top of the wellhead.     Borehole Enlargement (“BHE”)   The process opening up or enlarging the internal diameter of the wellbore. This is typically done with under-reamers, reamers, or hole openers.     Closed Loop Drilling Systems   A solids control system in which the drilling mud is reconditioned and recycled through the drilling process on the rig itself.     Coiled Tubing   A continuous string of flexible steel tubing, often hundreds or thousands of feet long, that is wound onto a reel, often dozens of feet in diameter. The reel is an integral part of the coiled tubing unit, which consists of several devices that ensure the tubing can be safely and efficiently inserted into the well from the surface. Because tubing can be lowered into a well without having to make up joints of tubing, running coiled tubing into the well is faster and less expensive than running conventional tubing. Rapid advances in the use of coiled tubing make it a popular way in which to run tubing into and out of a well. Also called reeled tubing.     Cuttings   Fragments of rock dislodged by the bit and brought to the surface in the drilling mud. Washed and dried cutting samples are analyzed by geologist to obtain information about the formations drilled.     Directional Well   Well drilled in an orientation other than vertical in order to access broader portions of the formation.     Drawworks   The hoisting mechanism on a drilling rig. It is essentially a large winch that spools off or takes in the drilling line and thus raises or lowers the drill stem and bit.   21    Table of Contents          Drill Pipe Elevator (Elevator)   On conventional rotary rigs and top-drive rigs, hinged steel devices with manual operating handles that crew members latch onto a tool joint (or a sub). Since the elevators are directly connected to the traveling block, or to the integrated traveling block in the top drive, when the driller raises or lowers the block or the top-drive unit, the drill pipe is also raised or lowered.     Drilling jars   A percussion tool operated manually or hydraulically to deliver a heavy downward blow to free a stuck drill stem.     Drilling mud   A specially compounded liquid circulated through the wellbore during rotary drilling operations.     Drilling riser   A conduit used in offshore drilling through which the drill bit and other tools are passed from the rig on the water’s surface to the sea floor.     Drill stem   All members in the assembly used for rotary drilling from the swivel to the bit, including the Kelly, the drill pipe and tool joints, the drill collars, the stabilizers, and various specialty items.     Fiberglass-reinforced spoolable pipe   A spoolable glass fiber-reinforced epoxy composite tubular product for onshore oil and gas gathering and injection systems, with superior corrosion resistant properties and lower installed cost than steel.     Flexible pipe   A dynamic riser that connects subsea production equipment to a topside facility allowing for the flow of oil, gas, and/or water. Also used on the seafloor to tie wells and subsea equipment together.     Formation   A bed or deposit composed throughout of substantially the same kind of rock; often a lithologic unit. Each formation is given a name, frequently as a result of the study of the formation outcrop at the surface and sometimes based on fossils found in the formation.     FPSO   A Floating Production, Storage and Offloading vessel used to receive hydrocarbons from subsea wells, and then produce and store the hydrocarbons until they can be offloaded to a tanker or pipeline.     Hardbanding   A special wear-resistant material often applied to tool joints to prevent abrasive wear to the area when the pipe is being rotated downhole.     Hydraulic Fracturing   The process of creating fractures in a formation by pumping fluids, at high pressures, into the reservoir, which allows or enhances the flow of hydrocarbons.     Iron Roughneck   A floor-mounted combination of a spinning wrench and a torque wrench. The Iron Roughneck moves into position hydraulically and eliminates the manual handling involved with suspended individual tools.     Jack-up rig   A mobile bottom-supported offshore drilling structure with columnar or open-truss legs that support the deck and hull. When positioned over the drilling site, the bottoms of the legs penetrate the seafloor.     Jar   A mechanical device placed near the top of the drill stem which allows the driller to strike a very heavy blow upward or downward on stuck pipe.     Joint   1. In drilling, a single length (from 16 feet to 45 feet, or 5 meters to 14.5 meters, depending on its range length) of drill pipe, drill collar, casing or tubing that has threaded connections at both ends. Several joints screwed together constitute a stand of pipe. 2. In pipelining, a single length (usually 40 feet-12 meters) of pipe. 3. In sucker rod pumping, a single length of sucker rod that has threaded connections at both ends.     Kelly   The heavy steel tubular device, four-or six-sided, suspended from the swivel through the rotary table and connected to the top joint of drill pipe to turn the drill stem as the rotary table returns. It has a bored passageway that permits fluid to be circulated into the drill stem and up the annulus, or vice versa. Kellys manufactured to API specifications are available only in four-or six-sided versions, are either 40 or 54 feet (12 or 16 meters) long, and have diameters as small as 2.5 inches (6 centimeters) and as large as 6 inches (15 centimeters).     Kelly bushing   A special device placed around the kelly that mates with the kelly flats and fits into the master bushing of the rotary table. The kelly bushing is designed so that the kelly is free to move up or down through it. The bottom of the bushing may be shaped to fit the opening in the master bushing or it may have pins that fit into the master bushing. In either case, when the kelly bushing is inserted into the master bushing and the master bushing is turned, the kelly bushing also turns. Since the kelly bushing fits onto the kelly, the kelly turns, and since the kelly is made up to the drill stem, the drill stem turns. Also called the drive bushing.   22    Table of Contents          Kelly spinner   A pneumatically operated device mounted on top of the kelly that, when actuated, causes the kelly to turn or spin. It is useful when the kelly or a joint of pipe attached to it must be spun up, that is, rotated rapidly for being made up.     Kick   An entry of water, gas, oil, or other formation fluid into the wellbore during drilling. It occurs because the pressure exerted by the column of drilling fluid is not great enough to overcome the pressure exerted by the fluids in the formation drilled. If prompt action is not taken to control the kick, or kill the well, a blowout may occur.     Making-up   1. To assemble and join parts to form a complete unit (e.g., to make up a string of drill pipe). 2. To screw together two threaded pieces. 3. To mix or prepare (e.g., to make up a tank of mud). 4. To compensate for (e.g., to make up for lost time).     Manual tongs (Tongs)   The large wrenches used for turning when making up or breaking out drill pipe, casing, tubing, or other pipe; variously called casing tongs, pipe tongs, and so forth, according to the specific use. Power tongs or power wrenches are pneumatically or hydraulically operated tools that serve to spin the pipe up tight and, in some instances to apply the final makeup torque.     Master bushing   A device that fits into the rotary table to accommodate the slips and drive the kelly bushing so that the rotating motion of the rotary table can be transmitted to the kelly. Also called rotary bushing.     Mooring system   The method by which a vessel or buoy is fixed to a certain position, whether permanently or temporarily.     Motion compensation equipment   Any device (such as a bumper sub or heave compensator) that serves to maintain constant weight on the bit in spite of vertical motion of a floating offshore drilling rig.     Mud pump   A large, high-pressure reciprocating pump used to circulate the mud on a drilling rig.     Plug gauging   The mechanical process of ensuring that the inside threads on a piece of drill pipe comply with API standards.     Pressure control equipment   Equipment used in: 1. The act of preventing the entry of formation fluids into a wellbore. 2. The act of controlling high pressures encountered in a well.     Pressure pumping   Pumping fluids into a well by applying pressure at the surface.     Ram blowout preventer   A blowout preventer that uses rams to seal off pressure on a hole that is with or without pipe. Also called a ram preventer.     Ring gauging   The mechanical process of ensuring that the outside threads on a piece of drill pipe comply with API standards.     Riser   A pipe through which liquids travel upward.     Riser pipe   The pipe and special fitting used on floating offshore drilling rigs to established a seal between the top of the wellbore, which is on the ocean floor, and the drilling equipment located above the surface of the water. A riser pipe serves as a guide for the drill stem from the drilling vessel to the wellhead and as a conductor or drilling fluid from the well to the vessel. The riser consists of several sections of pipe and includes special devices to compensate for any movement of the drilling rig caused by waves. Also called marine riser pipe, riser joint.     Rotary table   The principal piece of equipment in the rotary table assembly; a turning device used to impart rotational power to the drill stem while permitting vertical movement of the pipe for rotary drilling. The master bushing fits inside the opening of the rotary table; it turns the kelly bushing, which permits vertical movement of the kelly while the stem is turning.     Rotating blowout preventer (Rotating Head)   A sealing device used to close off the annular space around the kelly in drilling with pressure at the surface, usually installed above the main blowout preventers. A rotating head makes it possible to drill ahead even when there is pressure in the annulus that the weight of the drilling fluid is not overcoming; the head prevents the well from blowing out. It is used mainly in the drilling of formations that have low permeability. The rate of penetration through such formations is usually rapid.   23    Table of Contents          Safety clamps   A clamp placed very tightly around a drill collar that is suspended in the rotary table by drill collar slips. Should the slips fail, the clamp is too large to go through the opening in the rotary table and therefore prevents the drill collar string from falling into the hole. Also called drill collar clamp.     Shale shaker   A piece of drilling rig equipment that uses a vibrating screen to remove cuttings from the circulating fluid in rotary drilling operations. The size of the openings in the screen should be selected carefully to be the smallest size possible to allow 100 per cent flow of the fluid. Also called a shaker.     Slim-hole completions (Slim-hole Drilling)   Drilling in which the size of the hole is smaller than the conventional hole diameter for a given depth. This decrease in hole size enables the operator to run smaller casing, thereby lessening the cost of completion.     Slips   Wedge-shaped pieces of metal with serrated inserts (dies) or other gripping elements, such as serrated buttons, that suspend the drill pipe or drill collars in the master bushing of the rotary table when it is necessary to disconnect the drill stem from the kelly or from the top-drive unit’s drive shaft. Rotary slips fit around the drill pipe and wedge against the master bushing to support the pipe. Drill collar slips fit around a drill collar and wedge against the master bushing to support the drill collar. Power slips are pneumatically or hydraulically actuated devices that allow the crew to dispense with the manual handling of slips when making a connection.     Solids   See “Cuttings”     Spinning wrench   Air-powered or hydraulically powered wrench used to spin drill pipe in making or breaking connections.     Spinning-in   The rapid turning of the drill stem when one length of pipe is being joined to another. “Spinning-out” refers to separating the pipe.     Stand   The connected joints of pipe racked in the derrick or mast when making a trip. On a rig, the usual stand is about 90 feet (about 27 meters) long (three lengths of drill pipe screwed together), or a treble.     Steerable Technologies   Tools that allow for steering the BHA towards a target while rotating from surface.     String   The entire length of casing, tubing, sucker rods, or drill pipe run into a hole.     Sucker rod   A special steel pumping rod. Several rods screwed together make up the link between the pumping unit on the surface and the pump at the bottom of the well.     Tensioner   A system of devices installed on a floating offshore drilling rig to maintain a constant tension on the riser pipe, despite any vertical motion made by the rig. The guidelines must also be tensioned, so a separate tensioner system is provided for them.     Thermal desorption   The process of removing drilling mud from cuttings by applying heat directly to drill cuttings.     Tiebacks (Subsea)   A series of flowlines and pipes that connect numerous subsea wellheads to a single collection point.     Top drive   A device similar to a power swivel that is used in place of the rotary table to turn the drill stem. It also includes power tongs. Modern top drives combine the elevator, the tongs, the swivel, and the hook. Even though the rotary table assembly is not used to rotate the drill stem and bit, the top-drive system retains it to provide a place to set the slips to suspend the drill stem when drilling stops.     Torque wrench   Spinning wrench with a gauge for measuring the amount of torque being applied to the connection.   24    Table of Contents          Trouble cost   Costs incurred as a result of unanticipated complications while drilling a well. These costs are often referred to as contingency costs during the planning phase of a well.     Turret   Mechanical device that allows a floating vessel to rotate around stationary flowlines, umbilicals, and other associated risers.     Well completion   1. The activities and methods of preparing a well for the production of oil and gas or for other purposes, such as injection; the method by which one or more flow paths for hydrocarbons are established between the reservoir and the surface. 2. The system of tubulars, packers, and other tools installed beneath the wellhead in the production casing; that is, the tool assembly that provides the hydrocarbon flow path or paths.     Wellhead   The termination point of a wellbore at surface level or subsea, often incorporating various valves and control instruments.     Well stimulation   Any of several operations used to increase the production of a well, such as acidizing or fracturing.     Well workover   The performance of one or more of a variety of remedial operations on a producing oil well to try to increase production. Examples of workover jobs are deepening, plugging back, pulling and resetting liners, and squeeze cementing.     Wellbore   A borehole; the hole drilled by the bit. A wellbore may have casing in it or it may be open (uncased); or part of it may be cased, and part of it may be open. Also called a borehole or hole.     Wireline   A slender, rodlike or threadlike piece of metal usually small in diameter, that is used for lowering special tools (such as logging sondes, perforating guns, and so forth) into the well. Also called slick line.      ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS
