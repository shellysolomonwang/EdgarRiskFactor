ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS   Our investors should consider the following risks that could affect us and our business. Although we have tried to discuss key factors, our investors need to be aware that other risks may prove to be important in the future. New risks may emerge at any time, and we cannot predict such risks or estimate the extent to which they may affect our financial performance. Investors should carefully consider the following discussion of risks and the other information included or incorporated by reference in this Annual Report, including “Forward-Looking Statements,” which are included in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation.   RISK FACTORS INHERENT IN OUR BUSINESS  Market volatility and capital availability could adversely affect our business.  The capital and credit markets have been experiencing volatility and disruption. During the fourth quarter of 2008 and continuing into 2009, the volatility and disruption reached unprecedented levels. In many cases, the capital markets have exerted downward pressure on equity values and reduced the credit capacity for certain companies. Our ability to grow could be constrained if we do not have regular access to the capital and credit markets. If similar or more severe levels of market disruption and volatility return, our access to capital and credit markets could be disrupted, making growth through acquisitions and development projects difficult or impractical to pursue until such time as markets stabilize.  Our operating results may be materially adversely affected by unfavorable economic and market conditions.  Economic conditions worldwide have from time to time contributed to slowdowns in the oil and gas industry, as well as in the specific segments and markets in which we operate, resulting in reduced demand and increased price competition for our products and services. Our operating results in one or more geographic regions may also be affected by uncertain or changing economic conditions within that region. Volatility in commodity prices may have an impact on many of our customers, which, in turn, could have a negative impact on their ability to meet their obligations to us. If global economic and market conditions (including volatility in commodity markets), or economic conditions in the United States or other key markets, remain uncertain or persist, spread or deteriorate further, we may experience material impacts on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.  Uncertainty in the capital markets may increase the cost of debt and equity capital, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and business.  In 2008 and continuing into 2009, economic conditions in the United States experienced a downturn, primarily due to the sub-prime lending crisis, volatile energy prices, inflation concerns, slower economic activity, decreased consumer confidence, reduced corporate profits and capital spending, and increased unemployment. These conditions had an adverse impact on the credit markets. Although some of these conditions have improved in 2009 and 2010, continued uncertainty about market conditions may have an adverse effect on us resulting from, but not limited to, difficulty in obtaining financing necessary to expand facilities or acquire assets, increased financing cost and increasingly restrictive covenants.  Our cash flow depends heavily on the earnings and distributions of ONEOK Partners.  Our partnership interest in ONEOK Partners is one of our largest cash-generating assets. Therefore, our cash flow is heavily dependent upon the ability of ONEOK Partners to make distributions to its partners. A significant decline in ONEOK Partners’ earnings and/or cash distributions would have a corresponding negative impact on us. For information on the risk factors inherent in the business of ONEOK Partners, see the section below entitled “Risk Factors Related to ONEOK Partners’ Business” and Item 1A. Risk Factors in the ONEOK Partners Annual Report.         -18 -      Table of Contents     Some of our nonregulated businesses have a higher level of risk than our regulated businesses.   Some of our nonregulated operations, which includes ONEOK Partners’ gathering and processing business, most of its natural gas liquids business, and our energy services business, have a higher level of risk than our regulated operations, which include our distribution and ONEOK Partners’ natural gas pipelines business and a portion of its natural gas liquids business. We and ONEOK Partners expect to continue investing in natural gas and natural gas liquids projects and other related projects, some or all of which may involve nonregulated businesses or assets. These projects could involve risks associated with operational factors, such as competition and dependence on certain suppliers and customers, and financial, economic and political factors, such as rapid and significant changes in commodity prices, the cost and availability of capital and counterparty risk, including the inability of a counterparty, customer or supplier to fulfill a contractual obligation.   Our LDCs have recorded certain assets that may not be recoverable from our customers.  Accounting principles that govern our LDCs permit certain assets that result from the regulatory process to be recorded on our balance sheet that could not be recorded under GAAP for nonregulated entities. We consider factors such as rate orders from regulators, previous rate orders for substantially similar costs, written approval from the regulators and analysis of recoverability from internal and external legal counsel to determine the probability of future recovery of these assets. If we determine future recovery is no longer probable, we would be required to write off the regulatory assets at that time.  Terrorist attacks aimed at our facilities could adversely affect our business.  Since the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, the United States government has issued warnings that energy assets, specifically the nation’s pipeline infrastructure, may be future targets of terrorist organizations. These developments may subject our operations to increased risks. Any future terrorist attack that may target our facilities, those of our customers and, in some cases, those of other pipelines, could have a material adverse effect on our business.  Our businesses are subject to market and credit risks.   We are exposed to market and credit risks in all of our operations. To minimize the risk of commodity price fluctuations, we periodically enter into derivative transactions to hedge anticipated purchases and sales of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil, fuel requirements and firm transportation commitments. Interest-rate swaps are also used to manage interest-rate risk. Currency forward contracts are used to mitigate unexpected changes that may occur in anticipated revenue streams of our Canadian natural gas sales and purchases driven by currency rate fluctuations. However, financial derivative instrument contracts do not eliminate the risks. Specifically, such risks include commodity price changes, market supply shortages, interest rate changes and counterparty default. The impact of these variables could result in our inability to fulfill contractual obligations, significantly higher energy or fuel costs relative to corresponding sales contracts, or increased interest expense.   We are subject to the risk of loss resulting from nonpayment and/or nonperformance by customers of our Energy Services segment. The customers of our Energy Services segment are predominantly LDCs, industrial customers, natural gas producers and marketers that may experience deterioration of their financial condition as a result of changing market conditions or financial difficulties that could impact their creditworthiness or ability to pay for our services. Although we attempt to obtain adequate security for these risks, if we fail to adequately assess the creditworthiness of existing or future customers, unanticipated deterioration in their creditworthiness and any resulting nonpayment and/or nonperformance could adversely impact results of operations for our Energy Services segment. In addition, if any of our Energy Services segment’s customers filed for bankruptcy protection, we may not be able to recover amounts owed, which could materially negatively impact the results of operations for our Energy Services segment.  Increased competition could have a significant adverse financial impact on us.   The natural gas and natural gas liquids industries are expected to remain highly competitive. The demand for natural gas and NGLs is primarily a function of commodity prices, including prices for alternative energy sources, customer usage rates, weather, economic conditions and service costs. Our ability to compete also depends on a number of other factors, including competition from other pipelines for our existing load, the efficiency, quality and reliability of the services we provide, and competition for throughput for our gathering systems, pipelines, processing plants, fractionators and storage facilities.   We cannot predict when we will be subject to changes in legislation or regulation, nor can we predict the impact of these changes on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Although we believe our businesses are positioned to compete effectively in the energy market, there are no assurances that this will be true in the future.         -19 -      Table of Contents     We may not be able to successfully make additional strategic acquisitions or integrate businesses we acquire into our operations.   Our ability to successfully make strategic acquisitions and investments will depend on: (i) the extent to which acquisitions and investment opportunities become available; (ii) our success in bidding for the opportunities that do become available; (iii) regulatory approval, if required, of the acquisitions on favorable terms; and (iv) our access to capital, including our ability to use our equity in acquisitions or investments, and the terms upon which we obtain capital. If we are unable to make strategic investments and acquisitions, we may be unable to grow. If we are unable to successfully integrate new businesses into our operations, we could experience increased costs and losses on our investments.   Acquisitions that appear to be accretive may nevertheless reduce our cash from operations on a per share basis.  Any acquisition involves potential risks that may include, among other things:      ·    mistaken assumptions about volumes, revenues and costs, including potential synergies;             ·    an inability to successfully integrate the businesses we acquire;        ·    decrease in our liquidity as a result of our using a significant portion of our available cash or borrowing capacity to finance the acquisition;        ·    a significant increase in our interest expense or financial leverage if we incur additional debt to finance the acquisition;        ·    the assumption of unknown liabilities for which we are not indemnified or for which our indemnity is inadequate;        ·    an inability to hire, train or retain qualified personnel to manage and operate the acquired business and assets;        ·    limitations on rights to indemnity from the seller;        ·    mistaken assumptions about the overall costs of equity or debt;        ·    the diversion of management’s and employees’ attention from other business concerns;        ·    unforeseen difficulties operating in new product areas or new geographic areas;         ·    increased regulatory burdens;        ·    customer or key employee losses at an acquired business; and        ·    increased regulatory requirements.     If we consummate any future acquisitions, our capitalization and results of operations may change significantly, and investors will not have the opportunity to evaluate the economic, financial and other relevant information that we will consider in determining the application of our resources to future acquisitions.  Any reduction in our credit ratings could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.   Our long-term senior unsecured debt has been assigned an investment-grade rating by S&P of “BBB” (Stable) and Moody’s of “Baa2” (Stable). However, we cannot provide assurance that any of our current ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances in the future so warrant. Specifically, if S&P or Moody’s were to downgrade our long-term rating, particularly below investment grade, our borrowing costs would increase, which would adversely affect our financial results, and our potential pool of investors and funding sources could decrease. If S&P or Moody’s were to downgrade the long-term ratings of ONEOK Partners below investment grade, ONEOK Partners would, under certain circumstances, be required to offer to repurchase certain of its senior notes. Further, if our short-term ratings were to fall below A-2 (capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is satisfactory) or P-2 (strong ability to repay short-term debt obligations), the current ratings assigned by S&P and Moody’s, respectively, it could significantly limit our access to the commercial paper market. Any such downgrade of our long- or short-term ratings could significantly increase our cost of capital and reduce the availability of capital and, thus, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. Ratings from credit agencies are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our securities. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.   A downgrade in our credit ratings below investment grade would negatively affect the operations of our Energy Services segment. If our credit ratings fall below investment grade, ratings triggers and/or adequate assurance clauses in many of our financial and wholesale physical contracts would be in effect. A ratings trigger or adequate assurance clause gives a counterparty the right to suspend or terminate the agreement unless margin thresholds are met. Margin requirements related to the trading activities of our Energy Services segment may also increase as a result of market volatility without regard to our credit rating. The additional increase in capital required to support our Energy Services segment would materially negatively impact our ability to compete, as well as our ability to actively manage the risk associated with existing storage and transportation contracts.         -20 -      Table of Contents     Employees within our marketing and trading operations may violate our risk management policies.  We have developed and implemented a comprehensive set of policies and procedures that involve both our senior management and the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors to assist us in managing risks associated with, among other things, the trading activities of our Energy Services segment. However, if our employees fail to adhere to these mandatory policies and procedures, we may be exposed to greater risk than we had anticipated.  Our indebtedness could impair our financial condition and our ability to fulfill our other obligations.  As of December 31, 2009, we had total indebtedness for borrowed money of approximately $1.9 billion, which excludes the debt of ONEOK Partners. Our indebtedness could have significant consequences. For example, it could:     ·    make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our notes and our other indebtedness due to the increased debt-service obligations, which could in turn result in an event of default on such other indebtedness or our notes;        ·    impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or general business purposes;        ·    diminish our ability to withstand a downturn in our business or the economy;        ·    require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to debt-service payments, reducing the availability of cash for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, or general corporate purposes;        ·    limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; and        ·    place us at a competitive disadvantage compared with our competitors that have proportionately less debt.     We are not prohibited under the indentures governing our senior notes from incurring additional indebtedness, but our debt agreements do subject us to certain operational limitations summarized in the next paragraph. If we incur significant additional indebtedness, it could worsen the negative consequences mentioned above and could adversely affect our ability to repay our other indebtedness.  Our revolving debt agreements with banks contain provisions that restrict our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to expand or pursue our business activities. For example, certain of these agreements contain provisions that, among other things, limit our ability to make loans or investments, make material changes to the nature of our business, merge, consolidate or engage in asset sales, grant liens, or make negative pledges. Certain agreements also require us to maintain certain financial ratios, which limit the amount of additional indebtedness we can incur, as described in the “Liquidity and Capital Resources” section of Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation. These restrictions could result in higher costs of borrowing and impair our ability to generate additional cash. Future financing agreements we may enter into may contain similar or more restrictive covenants.  If we are unable to meet our debt-service obligations, we could be forced to restructure or refinance our indebtedness, seek additional equity capital or sell assets. We may be unable to obtain financing or sell assets on satisfactory terms, or at all.  We are subject to comprehensive energy regulation by governmental agencies, and the recovery of our costs is dependent on regulatory action.   We are subject to comprehensive regulation by several federal, state and municipal utility regulatory agencies, which significantly influences our operating environment and our ability to recover our costs from utility customers. The utility regulatory authorities in Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas regulate many aspects of our utility operations, including customer service and the rates that we can charge customers. Federal, state and local agencies also have jurisdiction over many of our other activities, including regulation by the FERC of our storage and interstate pipeline assets. The profitability of our regulated operations is dependent on our ability to pass costs related to providing energy and other commodities through to our customers by filing synchronized rate cases. The regulatory environment applicable to our regulated businesses could impair our ability to recover costs historically absorbed by our customers.   We are unable to predict the impact that the future regulatory activities of these agencies will have on our operating results. Changes in regulations or the imposition of additional regulations could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, the results of our LDCs’ operations could be negatively impacted if the cost recovery mechanisms authorized by our rate cases do not function as anticipated.  Additionally, the regulatory authorities of each state in which we operate allow LDC’s to obtain weather protection. If the weather protection clause is disallowed, it would affect our business.         -21 -      Table of Contents     The volatility of natural gas prices may negatively impact LDC customers’ perception of natural gas.  Natural gas costs are passed through to the customers of our LDCs based on the actual cost of the natural gas purchased by the particular LDC. Substantial fluctuations in natural gas prices can occur from year to year. Sustained periods of high natural gas prices or of pronounced natural gas price volatility may negatively impact our LDC customers’ perception of natural gas, which could lead to customers selecting other energy alternatives, such as electricity, and to difficulties in the rate-making process. Additionally, high natural gas prices may cause customers to conserve more and may also adversely impact our accounts receivable collections, resulting in higher bad-debt expense.   Our business is subject to increased regulatory oversight and potential penalties.  The natural gas industry historically has been heavily regulated; therefore, there is no assurance that a more stringent regulatory approach will not be pursued by the FERC and the United States Congress, especially in light of previous market power abuse by certain companies engaged in interstate commerce. In response to this issue, the United States Congress, in the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPACT), developed requirements intended to ensure that the energy market is not impacted by the exercise of market power or manipulative conduct. The FERC then adopted the Market Manipulation Rules to implement the authority granted under EPACT. These rules are intended to prohibit fraud and manipulation and are subject to broad interpretation. EPACT also gave the FERC increased penalty authority for violations of these rules, as well as other FERC rules.  Demand for services of our Distribution and Energy Services segments and for certain of ONEOK Partners’ products is highly weather sensitive and seasonal.  The demand for natural gas and for certain of ONEOK Partners’ products, such as propane, is weather sensitive and seasonal, with a significant portion of revenues derived from sales to retail markets for heating during the winter months. Weather conditions directly influence the volume of, among other things, natural gas and propane delivered to customers. Deviations in weather from normal levels and the seasonal nature of certain of our segments’ business can create large variations in earnings and short-term cash requirements.  Proposed KCC “ring-fencing” regulations may have a significant impact on our natural gas distribution business in Kansas.  The KCC is considering new regulations, commonly known as “ring-fencing,” that would require us to operate our Kansas Gas Service division in a separate, financially independent entity. This new entity would not be permitted to rely upon the overall credit of ONEOK to obtain financing for its operations, potentially increasing the cost of its financing. In addition, this new entity may be required to register with the SEC as a reporting entity, repurchase and reissue public debt (including the payment of prepayment premiums), and negotiate separate credit facilities, all at substantial cost. If these additional costs, along with the other costs and expenses associated with the reorganization, are not recoverable from Kansas Gas Service customers, it would lower the earnings of our Distribution segment. Adoption by the KCC of certain of these proposed regulations may require prior authorization from the Kansas legislature.   We are subject to environmental regulations that could be difficult and costly to comply with.   We are subject to multiple environmental laws and regulations affecting many aspects of present and future operations, including air emissions, water quality, wastewater discharges, solid and hazardous wastes and hazardous material and substance management. These laws and regulations generally require us to obtain and comply with a wide variety of environmental registrations, licenses, permits, inspections and other approvals. Failure to comply with these laws, regulations, permits and licenses may expose us to fines, penalties and/or interruptions in our operations that could be material to the results of operations. If a leak or spill of hazardous substance occurs from our lines or facilities in the process of transporting natural gas or NGLs or at any facility that we own, operate or otherwise use, we could be held jointly and severally liable for all resulting liabilities, including investigation and clean-up costs, which could materially affect our results of operations and cash flows. In addition, emission controls required under the federal Clean Air Act and other similar federal and state laws could require unexpected capital expenditures at our facilities. In addition, the EPA has issued a proposed rule on air-quality standards, “National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for Reciprocating Internal Combustion Engines,” also known as RICE NESHAP, scheduled to be adopted in early 2013. The proposed rule will require capital expenditures over the next three years for the purchase and installation of new emissions-control equipment. We do not expect these expenditures to have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. We cannot assure that existing environmental regulations will not be revised or that new regulations will not be adopted or become applicable to us. Revised or additional regulations that result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions, particularly if those costs are not fully recoverable from customers, could have a material adverse          -22 -      Table of Contents     effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For further discussion on this topic, see Note L of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report.  We are subject to risks that could limit our access to capital, thereby increasing our costs and adversely affecting our results of operations.   We have grown rapidly in the last several years as a result of acquisitions. Further acquisitions may require additional capital. If we are not able to access capital at competitive rates, our strategy of enhancing the earnings potential of our existing assets, including through acquisitions of complementary assets or businesses, will be adversely affected. A number of factors could adversely affect our ability to access capital, including: (i) general economic conditions; (ii) capital market conditions; (iii) market prices for natural gas, NGLs and other hydrocarbons; (iv) the overall health of the energy and related industries; (v) our ability to maintain our investment-grade credit ratings; and (vi) our capital structure. Much of our business is capital intensive, and achievement of our long-term growth targets is dependent, at least in part, upon our ability to access capital at rates and on terms we determine to be attractive. If our ability to access capital becomes significantly constrained, our interest costs will likely increase and our financial condition and future results of operations could be significantly harmed.   Energy efficiency and technological advances may affect the demand for natural gas and adversely affect our operating results.  The national trend toward increased conservation and technological advances, including installation of improved insulation and the development of more efficient furnaces and other heating devices, may decrease the demand for natural gas by residential customers. More strict conservation measures in the future or technological advances in heating, conservation, energy generation or other devices could adversely affect our operations.  The cost of providing pension and postretirement health care benefits to eligible employees and qualified retirees is subject to changes in pension fund values and changing demographics and may increase.  We have a defined benefit pension plan for certain employees and postretirement welfare plans that provide postretirement medical and life insurance benefits to certain employees who retire with at least five years of service. The cost of providing these benefits to eligible current and former employees is subject to changes in the market value of our pension and postretirement benefit plan assets, changing demographics, including longer life expectancy of plan participants and their beneficiaries and changes in health care costs. For further discussion of our defined benefit pension plan, see Note K of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report.  Any sustained declines in equity markets and reductions in bond yields may have a material adverse effect on the value of our pension and postretirement benefit plan assets. In these circumstances, additional cash contributions to our pension plans may be required.   Our business could be adversely affected by strikes or work stoppages by our unionized employees.   As of January 31, 2010, 681of our 4,758 employees were represented by collective bargaining units under collective bargaining agreements. We are involved periodically in discussions with collective bargaining units representing some of our employees to negotiate or renegotiate labor agreements. We cannot predict the results of these negotiations, including whether any failure to reach new agreements will have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations or whether we will be able to reach any agreement with the collective bargaining units. Any failure to reach agreement on new labor contracts might result in a work stoppage. Any future work stoppage could, depending on the operations and the length of the work stoppage, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of certain operations.   We may face significant costs to comply with the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions.  Greenhouse gas emissions originate primarily from combustion engine exhaust, heater exhaust and fugitive methane gas emissions. Various federal and state legislative proposals have been introduced to regulate the emission of greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide and methane, and the United States Supreme Court has ruled that carbon dioxide is a pollutant subject to regulation by the EPA. In addition, there have been international efforts seeking legally binding reductions in emissions of greenhouse gases.         -23 -      Table of Contents     We believe it is likely that future governmental legislation and/or regulation may require us either to limit greenhouse gas emissions from our operations or to purchase allowances for such emissions that are actually attributable to our distribution customers or attributable to NGL customers of ONEOK Partners. However, we cannot predict precisely what form these future regulations will take, the stringency of the regulations, or when they will become effective. Several bills have been introduced in the United States Congress that would require carbon dioxide emission reductions. Previously considered proposals have included, among other things, limitations on the amount of greenhouse gases that can be emitted (so called “caps”) together with systems of emissions allowances. This system could require us to reduce emissions, even though the technology is not currently available for efficient reduction, or to purchase allowances for such emissions. Emissions also could be taxed independently of limits.  In addition to activities on the federal level, state and regional initiatives could also lead to the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions sooner and/or independent of federal regulation. These regulations could be more stringent than any federal legislation that is adopted.  Future legislation and/or regulation designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions could make some of our activities uneconomic to maintain or operate. Further, we may not be able to pass on the higher costs to our customers or recover all costs related to complying with greenhouse gas regulatory requirements. Our future results of operations, cash flows or financial condition could be adversely affected if such costs are not recovered through regulated rates or otherwise passed on to our customers.  We continue to monitor legislative and regulatory developments in this area. Although the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions may have a material impact on our operations and rates, we believe it is premature to attempt to quantify the potential costs of the impacts.   We do not fully hedge against commodity price changes, time differentials or locational differentials. This could result in decreased revenues and increased costs, thereby resulting in lower margins and adversely affecting our results of operations.   Certain of our nonregulated businesses are exposed to market risk and the impact of market price fluctuations of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil. Market risk refers to the risk of loss of cash flows and future earnings arising from adverse changes in commodity prices. Our Energy Services segment’s primary exposures arise from seasonal and locational price differentials and our ability to execute hedges. Our ONEOK Partners segment’s primary exposures arise from commodity prices with respect to processing agreements and the differentials between NGL and natural gas prices and their impact on our natural gas and NGL transportation, fractionation and exchange throughputs; the differentials between the individual NGL products; differentials between NGL prices at different locations and the seasonal differentials impacting the volume of natural gas and NGLs stored. Our ONEOK Partners and Energy Services segments are also exposed to the risk of changing prices or the cost of transportation resulting from purchasing natural gas or NGLs at one location and selling it at another (referred to as basis risk). To minimize the risk from market price fluctuations of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil, we use physical forward transactions and commodity derivative instruments such as futures contracts, swaps and options to manage market risk of existing or anticipated purchases and sales of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil. We adhere to policies and procedures that monitor our exposure to market risk from open positions. However, we do not fully hedge against commodity price changes, and therefore, we retain some exposure to market risk. Accordingly, any adverse changes to commodity prices could result in decreased revenue and/or increased costs.   Our Distribution segment uses storage to minimize the volatility of natural gas costs for our customers by storing natural gas in periods of low demand for consumption in peak demand periods. In addition, various natural gas supply contracts allow us the option to convert index-based purchases to fixed prices. Also, we use derivative instruments to hedge the cost of anticipated natural gas purchases during the winter heating months to protect customers from upward volatility in the market price of natural gas.  Federal, state and local jurisdictions may challenge our tax return positions.  The positions taken in our federal and state tax return filings require significant judgments, use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Significant judgment is also required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items. Despite management’s belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable, certain positions may be successfully challenged by federal, state and local jurisdictions.         -24 -      Table of Contents     Although we control ONEOK Partners, we may have conflicts of interest with ONEOK Partners which could subject us to claims that we have breached our fiduciary duty to ONEOK Partners and its unitholders.  We are the sole general partner and owned 45.1 percent of ONEOK Partners as of December 31, 2009. Conflicts of interest may arise between us and ONEOK Partners and its unitholders. In resolving these conflicts, we may favor our own interests and the interests of our affiliates over the interests of ONEOK Partners and its unitholders as long as the resolution does not conflict with the ONEOK Partners’ partnership agreement or our fiduciary duties to ONEOK Partners and its unitholders.  We are subject to physical and financial risks associated with climate change.  There is a growing belief that emissions of greenhouse gases may be linked to global climate change. Climate change creates physical and financial risk. Our customers’ energy needs vary with weather conditions, primarily temperature and humidity. For residential customers, heating and cooling represent their largest energy use. To the extent weather conditions are affected by climate change, customers’ energy use could increase or decrease depending on the duration and magnitude of any changes. Increased energy use due to weather changes may require us to invest in more pipeline and other infrastructure to serve increased demand. A decrease in energy use due to weather changes may affect our financial condition, through decreased revenues. Extreme weather conditions in general require more system backup, adding to costs, and can contribute to increased system stresses, including service interruptions. Weather conditions outside of our operating territory could also have an impact on our revenues. Severe weather impacts our operating territories primarily through hurricanes, thunderstorms, tornadoes and snow or ice storms. To the extent the frequency of extreme weather events increases, this could increase our cost of providing service. We may not be able to pass on the higher costs to our customers or recover all the costs related to mitigating these physical risks. To the extent financial markets view climate change and emissions of greenhouse gases as a financial risk, this could negatively affect our ability to access capital markets or cause us to receive less favorable terms and conditions in future financings. Our business could be affected by the potential for lawsuits against greenhouse gas emitters, based on links drawn between greenhouse gas emissions and climate change.  RISK FACTORS RELATED TO ONEOK PARTNERS’ BUSINESS  The volatility of natural gas, crude oil and NGL prices could adversely affect ONEOK Partners’ cash flow.  A significant portion of ONEOK Partners’ revenues are derived from the sale of commodities that are received as payment for gathering and processing services, for the transportation and storage of natural gas, and for the sale of purity NGL products in ONEOK Partners’ natural gas liquids business. Commodity prices have been volatile and are likely to continue to be so in the future. The prices ONEOK Partners receives for its commodities are subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors beyond ONEOK Partners’ control, including the following:     ·    overall domestic and global economic conditions;        ·    relatively minor changes in the supply of, and demand for, domestic and foreign energy;        ·    market uncertainty;        ·    the availability and cost of transportation capacity;        ·    the level of consumer product demand;        ·    geopolitical conditions impacting supply and demand for natural gas and crude oil;        ·    weather conditions;        ·    domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes;        ·    the price and availability of alternative fuels;        ·    speculation in the commodity futures markets;        ·    overall domestic and global economic conditions;        ·    the price of natural gas, crude oil, NGL and liquefied natural gas imports; and        ·    the effect of worldwide energy conservation measures.     These external factors and the volatile nature of the energy markets make it difficult to reliably estimate future prices of commodities and the impact commodity price fluctuations have on our customers and their need for our services. As commodity prices decline, ONEOK Partners is paid less for its commodities, thereby reducing its cash flow. In addition, production could also decline.         -25 -      Table of Contents     ONEOK Partners’ use of financial instruments to hedge market risk may result in reduced income.  ONEOK Partners utilizes financial instruments to mitigate its exposure to interest rate and commodity price fluctuations. Hedging instruments that are used to reduce its exposure to interest rate fluctuations could expose it to risk of financial loss where it has contracted for variable-rate swap instruments to hedge fixed-rate instruments and the variable rate exceeds the fixed rate. In addition, these hedging arrangements may limit the benefit ONEOK Partners would otherwise receive if it has contracted for fixed-rate swap agreements to hedge variable-rate instruments and the variable rate falls below the fixed rate. Hedging arrangements that are used to reduce ONEOK Partners’ exposure to commodity price fluctuations may limit the benefit ONEOK Partners would otherwise receive if market prices for natural gas, crude oil and NGLs exceed the stated price in the hedge instrument for these commodities.  ONEOK Partners’ inability to develop and execute growth projects and acquire new assets could result in reduced cash distributions to its unitholders and to ONEOK.  ONEOK Partners’ primary business objectives are to generate cash flow sufficient to pay quarterly cash distributions to unitholders and to increase quarterly cash distributions over time. ONEOK Partners’ ability to maintain and grow its distributions to unitholders, including ONEOK, depends on the growth of its existing businesses and strategic acquisitions. Accordingly, if ONEOK Partners is unable to implement business development opportunities and finance such activities on economically acceptable terms, its future growth will be limited, which could adversely impact its and our results of operations and cash flows.  Growing ONEOK Partners’ business by constructing new pipelines and plants or making modifications to its existing facilities subjects ONEOK Partners to construction risks and risks that adequate natural gas or NGL supplies will not be available upon completion of the facilities.  One of the ways ONEOK Partners intends to grow its business is through the construction of new pipelines and new gathering, processing, storage and fractionation facilities and through modifications to ONEOK Partners’ existing pipelines and existing gathering, processing, storage and fractionation facilities. The construction and modification of pipelines and gathering, processing, storage and fractionation facilities may require significant capital expenditures, which may exceed ONEOK Partners’ estimates, and involves numerous regulatory, environmental, political and legal uncertainties. Construction projects in ONEOK Partners’ industry may increase demand for labor, materials and rights of way, which, may, in turn, impact ONEOK Partners’ costs and schedule. If ONEOK Partners undertakes these projects, it may not be able to complete them on schedule or at the budgeted cost. Additionally, ONEOK Partners’ revenues may not increase immediately upon the expenditure of funds on a particular project. For instance, if ONEOK Partners builds a new pipeline, the construction will occur over an extended period of time, and ONEOK Partners will not receive any material increases in revenues until after completion of the project. ONEOK Partners may have only limited natural gas or NGL supplies committed to these facilities prior to their construction. Additionally, ONEOK Partners may construct facilities to capture anticipated future growth in production in a region in which anticipated production growth does not materialize. ONEOK Partners may also rely on estimates of proved reserves in ONEOK Partners’ decision to construct new pipelines and facilities, which may prove to be inaccurate because there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves. As a result, new facilities may not be able to attract enough natural gas or NGLs to achieve ONEOK Partners’ expected investment return, which could materially adversely affect ONEOK Partners’ results of operations and financial condition.  ONEOK Partners does not own all of the land on which its pipelines and facilities are located, and it leases certain facilities and equipment, which could disrupt its operations.  ONEOK Partners does not own all of the land on which certain of its pipelines and facilities are located, and is, therefore, subject to the risk of increased costs to maintain necessary land use. ONEOK Partners obtains the rights to construct and operate certain of its pipelines and related facilities on land owned by third parties and governmental agencies for a specific period of time. ONEOK Partners’ loss of these rights, through its inability to renew right-of-way contracts on acceptable terms or increased costs to renew such rights, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  Additionally, certain gas processing or other facilities (or parts thereof) used by ONEOK Partners are leased from third parties for specific periods. ONEOK Partners’ inability to renew equipment leases or otherwise maintain the right to utilize such facilities and equipment on acceptable terms, or the increased costs to maintain such rights, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.         -26 -      Table of Contents     ONEOK Partners’ operations are subject to operational hazards and unforeseen interruptions, which could materially adversely affect its business and for which ONEOK Partners may not be adequately insured.  ONEOK Partners’ operations are subject to all of the risks and hazards typically associated with the operation of natural gas and natural gas liquids gathering and transportation pipelines, storage facilities and processing and fractionation plants. Operating risks include, but are not limited to, leaks, pipeline ruptures, the breakdown or failure of equipment or processes, and the performance of pipeline facilities below expected levels of capacity and efficiency. Other operational hazards and unforeseen interruptions include adverse weather conditions, accidents, the collision of equipment with ONEOK Partners’ pipeline facilities (for example, this may occur if a third party were to perform excavation or construction work near ONEOK Partners’ facilities) and catastrophic events such as explosions, fires, hurricanes, earthquakes, floods or other similar events beyond ONEOK Partners’ control. It is also possible that ONEOK Partners’ infrastructure facilities could be direct targets or indirect casualties of an act of terrorism. A casualty occurrence might result in injury or loss of life, extensive property damage or environmental damage. Liabilities incurred and interruptions to the operation of ONEOK Partners’ pipeline caused by such an event could reduce revenues generated by ONEOK Partners and increase expenses, thereby impairing ONEOK Partners’ ability to meet its obligations. Insurance proceeds may not be adequate to cover all liabilities or expenses incurred or revenues lost, and ONEOK Partners is not fully insured against all risks inherent to ONEOK Partners’ business.  As a result of market conditions, premiums and deductibles for certain insurance policies can increase substantially, and in some instances, certain insurance may become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. Consequently, ONEOK Partners may not be able to renew existing insurance policies or procure other desirable insurance on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. If ONEOK Partners was to incur a significant liability for which ONEOK Partners was not fully insured, it could have a material adverse effect on ONEOK Partners’ financial position and results of operations. Further, the proceeds of any such insurance may not be paid in a timely manner and may be insufficient if such an event were to occur.  A shortage of skilled labor may make it difficult for ONEOK Partners to maintain labor productivity and competitive costs, which could affect operations and cash flows available for distribution.  ONEOK Partners’ operations require skilled and experienced laborers with proficiency in multiple tasks. In recent years, a shortage of workers trained in various skills associated with the midstream energy business has caused ONEOK Partners to conduct certain operations without full staff, thus hiring outside resources, which decreases its productivity and increases its costs. This shortage of trained workers is the result of experienced workers reaching retirement age, combined with the difficulty of attracting new laborers to the midstream energy industry. This shortage of skilled labor could continue over an extended period. If the shortage of experienced labor continues or worsens, it could have an adverse impact on ONEOK Partners’ labor productivity and costs and ONEOK Partners’ ability to expand production in the event there is an increase in the demand for ONEOK Partners’ products and services, which could adversely affect its operations and cash flows available for distribution to unitholders.  If the level of drilling and production in the Mid-Continent, Rocky Mountain, Texas and Gulf Coast regions substantially declines near its assets, ONEOK Partners’ volumes and revenue could decline.  ONEOK Partners’ ability to maintain or expand its businesses depends largely on the level of drilling and production by third parties in the Mid-Continent, Rocky Mountain, Texas and Gulf Coast regions. Drilling and production are impacted by factors beyond ONEOK Partners’ control, including:     ·    demand and prices for natural gas, NGLs and crude oil;        ·    producers’ finding and developing costs of reserves;        ·    producers’ desire and ability to obtain necessary permits in a timely and economic manner;        ·    natural gas field characteristics and production performance;        ·    surface access and infrastructure issues; and        ·    capacity constraints on natural gas, crude oil and natural gas liquids pipelines from the producing areas and ONEOK Partners’ facilities.     In addition, drilling and production may be impacted by environmental regulations governing water discharge. If the level of drilling and production in any of these regions substantially declines, ONEOK Partners’ volumes and revenue could be materially reduced.         -27 -      Table of Contents     If production from the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin remains flat or declines and demand for natural gas from the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin is greater in market areas other than the Midwestern United States, demand for ONEOK Partners’ interstate gas transportation services could significantly decrease.  ONEOK Partners depends on natural gas supply from the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin for some of ONEOK Partners’ interstate pipelines, primarily ONEOK Partners’ investment in Northern Border Pipeline, that transport Canadian natural gas from the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin to the Midwestern U.S. market area. If demand for natural gas increases in Canada or other markets not served by ONEOK Partners’ interstate pipelines and/or production remains flat or declines, demand for transportation service on ONEOK Partners’ interstate natural gas pipelines could decrease significantly, which could adversely impact ONEOK Partners’ results of operations and cash flows available for distributions.  Pipeline integrity programs and repairs may impose significant costs and liabilities.  Pursuant to a United States Department of Transportation rule, pipeline operators were required to develop integrity management programs for intrastate and interstate natural gas and natural gas liquids pipelines located near high consequence areas, where a leak or rupture could do the most harm. The rule also requires operators to perform ongoing assessments of pipeline integrity; identify and characterize applicable threats to pipeline segments that could impact a high consequence area; improve data collection, integration and analysis; repair and remediate the pipeline as necessary; and implement preventive and mitigating actions. The results of these testing programs could cause ONEOK Partners to incur significant capital and operating expenditures to make repairs or take remediation, preventive or mitigating actions that are determined to be necessary.  ONEOK Partners’ regulated pipelines’ transportation rates are subject to review and possible adjustment by federal and state regulators.  ONEOK Partners’ regulated pipelines are subject to extensive regulation by the FERC and state regulatory agencies, which regulate most aspects of ONEOK Partners’ pipeline business, including ONEOK Partners’ transportation rates. Under the Natural Gas Act, which is applicable to interstate natural gas pipelines, and the Interstate Commerce Act, which is applicable to crude oil and natural gas liquids pipelines, interstate transportation rates must be just and reasonable and not unduly discriminatory.  Action by the FERC or a state regulatory agency could adversely affect ONEOK Partners’ pipeline business’ ability to establish or charge rates that would cover future increases in their costs, or even to continue to collect rates that cover current costs, including a reasonable return. ONEOK Partners cannot assure unitholders that its pipeline systems will be able to recover all of its costs through existing or future rates.  ONEOK Partners’ regulated pipeline companies have recorded certain assets that may not be recoverable from its customers.  Accounting policies for FERC-regulated companies permit certain assets that result from the regulated ratemaking process to be recorded on ONEOK Partners balance sheet that could not be recorded under GAAP for nonregulated entities. ONEOK Partners considers factors such as regulatory changes and the impact of competition to determine the probability of future recovery of these assets. If ONEOK Partners determines future recovery is no longer probable, ONEOK Partners would be required to write off the regulatory assets at that time.  ONEOK Partners’ operations are subject to federal and state laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, which may expose it to significant costs and liabilities.  The risk of incurring substantial environmental costs and liabilities is inherent in ONEOK Partners’ business. ONEOK Partners’ operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into, or otherwise relating to the protection of, the environment. Examples of these laws include:     ·    the Clean Air Act and analogous state laws that impose obligations related to air emissions;        ·    the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws that regulate discharge of waste water from ONEOK Partners’ facilities to state and federal waters;        ·    the federal CERCLA and analogous state laws that regulate the cleanup of hazardous substances that may have been released at properties currently or previously owned or operated by ONEOK Partners or locations to which ONEOK Partners has sent waste for disposal;        ·    the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and analogous state laws that impose requirements for the handling and discharge of solid and hazardous waste from ONEOK Partners’ facilities; and        ·    the EPA has issued a proposed rule on air quality standards, known as RICE NESHAP, scheduled to be adopted in early 2013.            -28 -      Table of Contents     Various governmental authorities, including the EPA, have the power to enforce compliance with these laws and regulations and the permits issued under them. Violators are subject to administrative, civil and criminal penalties, including civil fines, injunctions or both. Joint and several, strict liability may be incurred without regard to fault under the CERCLA, Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and analogous state laws for the remediation of contaminated areas.  There is an inherent risk of incurring environmental costs and liabilities in ONEOK Partners’ business due to its handling of the products it gathers, transports, processes and stores, air emissions related to its operations, historical industry operations and waste disposal practices, some of which may be material. Private parties, including the owners of properties through which ONEOK Partners’ pipeline systems pass, may have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance as well as to seek damages for non-compliance with environmental laws and regulations or for personal injury or property damage arising from ONEOK Partners’ operations. Some sites ONEOK Partners operates are located near current or former third-party hydrocarbon storage and processing operations, and there is a risk that contamination has migrated from those sites to ONEOK Partners’ sites. In addition, increasingly strict laws, regulations and enforcement policies could significantly increase ONEOK Partners’ compliance costs and the cost of any remediation that may become necessary, some of which may be material. Additional information is included under Item 1, Business under “Environmental and Safety Matters” and in Note L of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report.  ONEOK Partners’ insurance may not cover all environmental risks and costs or may not provide sufficient coverage in the event an environmental claim is made against ONEOK Partners. ONEOK Partners’ business may be materially adversely affected by increased costs due to stricter pollution-control requirements or liabilities resulting from non-compliance with required operating or other regulatory permits. New environmental regulations might also materially adversely affect ONEOK Partners’ products and activities, and federal and state agencies could impose additional safety requirements, all of which could materially affect ONEOK Partners’ profitability.  In the competition for customers, ONEOK Partners may have significant levels of uncontracted or discounted transportation and storage capacity on its natural gas and natural gas liquids pipelines, processing, fractionation and storage assets.  ONEOK Partners’ natural gas and natural gas liquids pipelines, processing, fractionation and storage assets compete with other pipelines, processing, fractionation and storage facilities for natural gas and NGL supplies delivered to the markets it serves. As a result of competition, at any given time ONEOK Partners may have significant levels of uncontracted or discounted capacity on its pipelines, processing, fractionation and in its storage assets, which could have a material adverse impact on ONEOK Partners’ results of operations.  ONEOK Partners is exposed to the credit risk of its customers or counterparties, and its credit risk management may not be adequate to protect against such risk.  ONEOK Partners is subject to the risk of loss resulting from nonpayment and/or nonperformance by ONEOK Partners’ customers or counterparties. ONEOK Partners’ customers or counterparties may experience rapid deterioration of their financial condition as a result of changing market conditions or financial difficulties that could impact their creditworthiness or ability to pay ONEOK Partners for its services. ONEOK Partners assesses the creditworthiness of its customers or counterparties and obtains collateral as it deems appropriate. If ONEOK Partners fails to adequately assess the creditworthiness of existing or future customers or counterparties, unanticipated deterioration in their creditworthiness and any resulting nonpayment and/or nonperformance could adversely impact ONEOK Partners’ results of operations. In addition, if any of ONEOK Partners’ customers or counterparties files for bankruptcy protection, this could have a material negative impact on ONEOK Partners’ results of operations.  Any reduction in ONEOK Partners’ credit ratings could materially and adversely affect its business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.  ONEOK Partners’ senior unsecured long-term debt has been assigned an investment-grade rating by Moody’s of “Baa2” (Stable) and by S&P of “BBB” (Stable). However, we cannot provide assurance that any of its current ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances in the future so warrant. Specifically, if Moody’s or S&P were to downgrade ONEOK Partners’ long-term debt rating, particularly below investment grade, its borrowing costs would increase, which would adversely affect its financial results, and its potential pool of investors and funding sources could decrease. Ratings from credit agencies are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold ONEOK Partners’ securities. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.         -29 -      Table of Contents     A downgrade of ONEOK Partners’ credit rating may require ONEOK Partners to offer to repurchase certain of its senior notes or may impair its ability to access capital.  ONEOK Partners could be required to offer to repurchase certain of its senior notes due 2010 and 2011 at par value, plus any accrued and unpaid interest, if Moody’s or S&P rates those senior notes below investment grade (Baa3 for Moody’s and BBB- for S&P) and the investment-grade rating is not reinstated within a period of 40 days; however, once the $250 million 2010 senior notes have been retired, whether by maturity, redemption or otherwise, ONEOK Partners will no longer have any obligation to offer to repurchase the $225 million 2011 senior notes in the event its credit rating falls below investment grade. Further, the indenture governing ONEOK Partners’ senior notes due 2010 and 2011 include an event of default upon acceleration of other indebtedness of $25 million or more, and the indentures governing ONEOK Partners’ senior notes due 2012, 2016, 2019, 2036 and 2037 include an event of default upon the acceleration of other indebtedness of $100 million or more that would be triggered by such an offer to repurchase. Such an event of default would entitle the trustee or the holders of 25 percent in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding senior notes due 2010, 2011, 2012, 2016, 2019, 2036 and 2037 to declare those notes immediately due and payable in full. ONEOK Partners may not have sufficient cash on hand to repurchase and repay any accelerated senior notes, which may cause ONEOK Partners to borrow money under its credit facilities or seek alternative financing sources to finance the repurchases and repayment. ONEOK Partners could also face difficulties accessing capital or its borrowing costs could increase, impacting its ability to obtain financing for acquisitions or capital expenditures, to refinance indebtedness and to fulfill its debt obligations.  ONEOK Partners has adopted certain valuation methodologies that may result in a shift of income, gain, loss and deduction between the general partner and the unitholders. The IRS may challenge this treatment, which could adversely affect the value of its limited partner units.  When ONEOK Partners issues additional units or engages in certain other transactions, ONEOK Partners determines the fair market value of its assets and allocates any unrealized gain or loss attributable to its assets to the capital accounts of its unitholders and its general partner. ONEOK Partners’ methodology may be viewed as understating the value of its assets. In that case, there may be a shift of income, gain, loss and deduction between certain unitholders and the general partner, which may be unfavorable to such unitholders. Moreover, under ONEOK Partners’ current valuation methods, subsequent purchasers of common units may have a greater portion of their Internal Revenue Code Section 743(b) adjustment allocated to ONEOK Partners’ tangible assets and a lesser portion allocated to ONEOK Partners’ intangible assets. The IRS may challenge ONEOK Partners’ valuation methods or ONEOK Partners’ allocation of the Section 743(b) adjustment attributable to ONEOK Partners’ tangible and intangible assets, and allocations of income, gain, loss and deduction between the general partner and certain of ONEOK Partners’ unitholders.  A successful IRS challenge to these methods or allocations could adversely affect the amount of taxable income or loss being allocated to ONEOK Partners’ unitholders. It also could affect the amount of gain from ONEOK Partners unitholders’ sale of common units and could have a negative impact on the value of the common units or result in audit adjustments to ONEOK Partners unitholders’ tax returns without the benefit of additional deductions.  ONEOK Partners’ treatment of a purchaser of common units as having the same tax benefits as the seller could be challenged, resulting in a reduction in value of the common units.  Because ONEOK Partners cannot match transferors and transferees of common units, ONEOK Partners is required to maintain the uniformity of the economic and tax characteristics of these units in the hands of the purchasers and sellers of these units. ONEOK Partners does so by adopting certain depreciation conventions that do not conform to all aspects of the United States Treasury regulations. An IRS challenge to these conventions could adversely affect the tax benefits to a unitholder of ownership of the common units and could have a negative impact on their value or result in audit adjustments to ONEOK Partners unitholders’ tax returns.
