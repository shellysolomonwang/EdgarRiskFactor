Item 1A. Risk Factors.”  Marketing and Customers  We market the majority of our natural gas, NGL and oil production from the properties we operate for both our interest and that of the other working interest owners and royalty owners. Natural gas, NGLs and oil purchasers are selected on the basis of price, credit quality and service reliability. For a summary of purchasers of our natural gas, NGLs and oil production that accounted for 10% or more of consolidated revenue, see Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements. Because alternative purchasers of natural gas and oil are usually readily available, we believe that the loss or any of these purchasers would not have a material adverse effect on our operations. We sell our gas pursuant to a variety of contractual arrangements, generally month-to-month and one to five-year contracts. We sell less than 10% of our production subject to contracts longer than five years. Pricing on the month-to-month and short-term contracts is based largely on the New York Mercantile Exchange (“NYMEX”) pricing, with fixed or floating basis. For one to five-year contracts, our natural gas is sold on NYMEX pricing, published regional index pricing or percentage of proceeds sales based on local indices. We sell less than 0.1% of our production under long-term fixed price contracts. Many contracts contain provisions for periodic price adjustment, redetermination and other terms customary in the industry. In the Marcellus Shale, our natural gas is sold to utilities, marketing companies and industrial users. In areas other than the Marcellus Shale, our natural gas is sold to mid stream companies along with utilities and industrial users. Our oil is sold under contracts ranging in terms from month-to-month, up to as long as one year. The pricing for oil is based upon the posted prices set by major purchasers in the production area, reporting publications, or upon NYMEX pricing or fixed pricing. All oil pricing is adjusted for quality and transportation differentials. Our NGL production is typically sold to natural gas processors or, in some cases, to other purchasers or users of NGLs. Currently, there is little demand, or existing facilities to create demand, for ethane in the Appalachian region so, for our Appalachian production volumes, ethane remains in the natural gas stream. For additional information, see “Risk Factors – Our business depends on natural gas and oil transportation and processing facilities, most of which are owned by others and our ability to contract with those parties,” in Item 1A of this report.  We enter into hedging transactions with unaffiliated third parties for a varying portion of our production to achieve more predictable cash flows and to reduce our exposure to short-term fluctuations in natural gas, NGL and oil prices. For a more detailed discussion, see the information set forth in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.” Proximity to local markets, availability of competitive fuels and overall supply and demand are factors affecting the prices for which our production can be sold. Market volatility due to fluctuating weather conditions, international political developments, overall energy supply and demand, economic growth rates and other factors in the United States and worldwide have had, and will continue to have, a significant effect on energy prices.  We incur gathering and transportation expenses to move our natural gas and crude oil from the wellhead and tanks to purchaser specified delivery points. These expenses vary based on volume, distance shipped and the fee charged by the third-party transporters. In the Southwestern region, our natural gas and oil production is transported primarily through third-party trucks, field gathering systems and transmission pipelines. Transportation capacity on these gathering and transportation systems and pipelines is occasionally constrained. In Appalachia, we own approximately 3,400 miles of gas gathering and transportation pipelines, which transport a portion of our Appalachian gas production and third-party gas to transmission lines and directly to end-users, and interstate pipelines. Our remaining Appalachian gas volume is transported on third-party pipelines on which, in some cases, we hold long-term contractual capacity. For additional information, see “Risk Factors – Our business depends on natural gas and oil transportation and processing facilities, most of which are owned by others and our ability to contract with those parties,” in Item 1A of this report.    14    Table of Contents We have not experienced significant difficulty to date in finding a market for all of our production as it becomes available or in transporting our production to those markets; however, there is no assurance that we will always be able to transport and market all of our production or obtain favorable prices.  Seasonal Nature of Business  Generally, but not always, the demand for natural gas decreases during the summer months and increases during the winter months. Seasonal anomalies such as mild winters or hot summers sometimes lessen this fluctuation. In addition, pipelines, utilities, local distribution companies and industrial end users utilize natural gas storage facilities and purchase some of their anticipated winter requirements during the summer. This can also lessen seasonal demand.  Governmental Regulation  Our operations are substantially affected by federal, state and local laws and regulations. In particular, natural gas and oil production and related operations are, or have been, subject to taxes and numerous other laws and regulations. All of the jurisdictions in which we own or operate producing crude oil and natural gas properties have statutory provisions regulating the exploration for and production of crude oil and natural gas, including provisions related to permits for the drilling of wells, bonding requirements to drill or operate wells, the location of wells, the method of drilling and casing wells, the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled, sourcing and disposal of water used in the drilling and completion process, and the abandonment of wells. Our operations are also subject to various conservation laws and regulations. These include the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units, the number of wells which may be drilled in an area, and the unitization or pooling of crude oil and natural gas wells, as well as regulations that generally prohibit the venting or flaring of natural gas, and impose certain requirements regarding the ratability or fair apportionment of production from fields and individual wells.  In August 2005, Congress enacted the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (“EPAct 2005”). Among other matters, the EPAct 2005 amends the Natural Gas Act (“NGA”), to make it unlawful for “any entity,” including otherwise non-jurisdictional producers such as Range, to use any deceptive or manipulative device or contrivance in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas or the purchase or sale of transportation services subject to regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”), in contravention of rules prescribed by the FERC. On January 20, 2006, the FERC issued rules implementing this provision. The rules make it unlawful in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas subject to the jurisdiction of FERC, or the purchase or sale of transportation services subject to the jurisdiction of FERC, for any entity, directly or indirectly, to use or employ any device, scheme or artifice to defraud; to make any untrue statement of material fact or omit any such statement necessary to make the statements not misleading; or to engage in any act or practice that operates as a fraud or deceit upon any person. EPAct 2005 also gives the FERC authority to impose civil penalties for violations of the NGA up to $1,000,000 per day per violation. The new anti-manipulation rule does not apply to activities that relate only to intrastate or other non-jurisdictional sale or gathering, but does apply to activities or otherwise non-jurisdictional entities to the extent the activities are conducted “in connection with” gas sales, purchases or transportation subject to FERC jurisdiction which includes the reporting requirements under Order Nos. 704 and 720, described below. It therefore reflects a significant expansion of FERC’s enforcement authority. Range has not been affected differently than any other producer of natural gas by this act.  Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations can result in substantial penalties. The regulatory burden on the industry increases the cost of doing business and affects profitability. Although we believe we are in substantial compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, such laws and regulations are frequently amended or reinterpreted. Therefore, we are unable to predict the future costs or impact of compliance. Additional proposals and proceedings that affect the oil and gas industry are regularly considered by Congress, the states, the FERC, and the courts. We cannot predict when or whether any such proposals may become effective.  On December 26, 2007, FERC issued a final rule on the annual natural gas transaction reporting requirements, as amended by subsequent orders on rehearing (“Order 704”). Under Order 704, wholesale buyers and sellers of more than 2.2 million Mmbtus of physical natural gas in the previous calendar year, including natural gas gatherers and marketers, are now required to report, on May 1 of each year beginning in 2009, aggregate volumes of natural gas purchased or sold at wholesale in the prior calendar year to the extent such transactions utilize, contribute to, or may contribute to the formation of price indices. It is the responsibility of the reporting entity to determine which individual transactions should be reported based on the guidance of Order 704. Order 704 also requires market participants to indicate whether they report prices to any index publishers, and if so, whether their reporting complies with FERC’s policy statement on price reporting.  On November 20, 2008, FERC issued a final rule on the daily scheduled flow and capacity posting requirements (“Order 720”), which was modified on January 21, 2010 (“Order 720-A”) and July 21, 2010 (“Order 720-B”). Under Orders 720, 720-A and 720-B, major non-interstate pipelines, defined as certain non-interstate pipelines delivering, on an annual basis, more than an average of 50 million Mmbtus of gas over the previous three calendar years, are required to post daily certain information regarding the pipeline’s capacity and scheduled flows for each receipt and delivery point that has a design capacity equal to or greater than 15,000 Mmbtu per day.    15    Table of Contents Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety Matters  Our operations are subject to numerous stringent federal, state and local statutes and regulations governing occupational health and safety, the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection, some of which carry substantial administrative, civil and criminal penalties for failure to comply. These laws and regulations may require the acquisition of a permit before drilling commences, restrict the types, quantities and concentrations of various substances that can be released into the environment in connection with drilling, production and transporting through pipelines, govern the sourcing and disposal of water used in the drilling and completion process, limit or prohibit drilling activities in certain areas and on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands, frontier and other protected areas, require some form of remedial action to prevent or mitigate pollution from existing and former operations such as plugging abandoned wells or closing earthen impoundments and impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from operations or failure to comply with regulatory filings. In addition, these laws and regulations may restrict the rate of production.  The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, as amended (“CERCLA”), also known as the “Superfund” law, and comparable state laws impose liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a “hazardous substance” into the environment. These persons may include owners or operators of the disposal site or sites where the release occurred and companies that disposed of or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances at the site where the release occurred. Under CERCLA, all of these persons may be subject to joint and several liabilities for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies. In addition, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties, pursuant to environmental statutes, common law or both, to file claims for personal injury and property damages allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances or other pollutants into the environment. Although petroleum, including crude oil and natural gas, is not a “hazardous substance” under CERCLA, at least two courts have ruled that certain wastes associated with the production of crude oil may be classified as “hazardous substances” under CERCLA and that releases of such wastes may therefore give rise to liability under CERCLA. While we generate materials in the course of our operations that may be regulated as hazardous substances, we have not received notification that we may be potentially responsible for cleanup costs under CERCLA or comparable state laws. Other state laws regulate the disposal of oil and gas wastes, and new state and federal legislative initiatives that could have a significant impact on us may periodically be proposed and enacted.  We also may incur liability under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended (“RCRA”) and comparable state laws, which impose requirements related to the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. While there is an exclusion from the definition of hazardous wastes for “drilling fluids, produced waters, and other wastes associated with the exploration, development, or production of crude oil, natural gas or geothermal energy,” these wastes may be regulated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) or state agencies as non-hazardous solid waste. In addition, changes in law could result in the repeal of this exclusion; for instance, in September 2010, the Natural Resources Defense Council filed a petition for rulemaking with the EPA requesting reconsideration of the continued application of this RCRA exclusion but, to date, the EPA has not taken any action on the petition. Moreover, ordinary industrial wastes, such as paint wastes, waste solvents, laboratory wastes and waste compressor oils, can be regulated as hazardous wastes. Although the costs of managing wastes classified as hazardous waste may be significant, we do not expect to experience more burdensome costs than similarly situated companies.  We currently own or lease, and have in the past owned or leased, properties that for many years have been used for the exploration and production of crude oil and natural gas. Petroleum hydrocarbons or wastes may have been disposed of or released on or under the properties owned or leased by us, or on or under other locations where such materials have been taken for disposal. In addition, some of these properties have been operated by third parties whose treatment and disposal or release of petroleum hydrocarbons and wastes was not under our control. These properties and the materials disposed or released on them may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA and comparable state laws and regulations. Under such laws and regulations, we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes or property contamination, or to perform remedial activities to prevent future contamination.  The Federal Water Pollution Control Act, as amended and comparable state laws impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants, including produced waters and other oil and gas wastes, into federal and state waters. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA or the state. These laws and any implementing regulations provide for administrative, civil and criminal penalties for any unauthorized discharges of oil and other substances in reportable quantities and may impose substantial potential liability for the costs of removal, remediation and damages. Pursuant to these laws and regulations, we may be required to obtain and maintain approvals or permits for the discharge of wastewater or storm water and are required to develop and implement spill prevention, control and countermeasure plans, also referred to as “SPCC plans,” in connection with on-site storage of greater than threshold quantities of oil. We regularly review our natural gas and oil properties to determine the need for new or updated SPCC plans and, where necessary, we will be developing or upgrading such plans, the costs of which are not expected to be substantial.    16    Table of Contents The Oil Pollution Act of 1990, as amended, “OPA”, contains numerous requirements relating to the prevention of and response to oil spills into waters of the United States. The OPA subjects owners of facilities to strict, joint and several liability for all containment and cleanup costs and certain other damages arising from a spill, including, but not limited to, the costs of responding to a release of oil to surface waters. While we believe we have been in compliance with OPA, noncompliance could result in varying civil and criminal penalties and liabilities.  The Clean Air Act, as amended, and comparable state laws restrict the emission of air pollutants from many sources, including compressor stations. These laws and any implementing regulations may require us to obtain pre-approval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce air emissions, impose stringent air permit requirements, or use specific equipment or technologies to control emissions. We may be required to incur certain capital expenditures in the next few years for air pollution control equipment in connection with maintaining or obtaining operating permits addressing other air emission-related issues. We do not believe that such requirements will have a material adverse effect on our operations.  Changes in environmental laws and regulations sometimes occur, and any changes that result in more stringent and costly well construction, drilling, water management or completion activities or waste handling, storage, transport, disposal or cleanup requirements for any substances used or produced in our operations could materially adversely affect our operations and financial position, as well as those of the oil and gas industry in general. For instance, recent scientific studies have suggested that emissions of certain gases commonly referred to as “greenhouse gases” and including carbon dioxide and methane, may be contributing to warming of the Earth’s atmosphere.  Congress has from time to time considered legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and at least 20 states have already taken legal measures to control emissions of greenhouse gases, primarily through the planned development of greenhouse gas emission inventories and/or regional greenhouse gas cap and trade programs. In California, for example, the California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 requires the California Air Resources Board to adopt regulations by 2012 that will achieve an overall reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from all sources in California of 25% by 2020.  On April 2, 2007, the United States Supreme Court held that, if the EPA found that greenhouse gas concentrations endanger public health and welfare, it was obligated to regulate their emissions under the Clean Air Act. On December 15, 2009, the EPA issued “Endangerment and Cause of Contribute Findings for Greenhouse Gases under section 202(a) of the Clean Air Act,” in which it concluded that the atmospheric concentrations of several greenhouse gases threaten the health and welfare of future generations, and that the combined emissions of these gases from motor vehicles contribute to the atmospheric concentrations of these key greenhouse gases, and, hence, to the threat of climate change. On April 1, 2010, the EPA and the Department of Transportation finalized rules that limit emissions of greenhouse gases from motor vehicles and on April 2, 2010, the EPA finalized a rule that declared greenhouse gases “subject to regulation” on January 2, 2011, the date on which EPA’s mobile source rules impose actual compliance obligations.  While the EPA’s endangerment findings and its rules on greenhouse gas emissions from mobile sources do not specifically address stationary sources, it is the EPA’s view that once the mobile source rules were finalized in April 2010, emissions of greenhouse gases from stationary sources became covered under the federal Prevention of Significant Deterioration (“PSD”) and Title V air permit programs, which apply to “major sources” of air emissions. The EPA reset the “major source” thresholds to higher levels in its “Prevention of Significant Deterioration and Title V Greenhouse Gas Tailoring Rule” than were originally set in the Clean Air Act. Consequently, for the first six months of 2011, greenhouse gas sources were required to undergo PSD or Title V review only if they were otherwise subject to PSD review or Title V permitting due to other emissions, and BACT review applied to the PSD applicant if the expected GHG emission increase is greater than 75,000 tons per year. Beginning on July 1, 2011, sources not otherwise brought into PSD or Title V were be required to undergo PSD or Title V review due to their greenhouse gas emissions alone, if in excess of 100,000 tons per year.  On September 22, 2009, the EPA finalized a greenhouse gas reporting rule establishing a national greenhouse gas emissions collection and reporting program. The EPA rules require covered entities to measure greenhouse gas emissions from specified large greenhouse gas emissions sources in the United States beginning in 2011 for emissions occurring in 2010. On November 8, 2010, the EPA finalized amendments to this greenhouse gas reporting rule, expanding the rule to require certain owners and operators of onshore crude oil and natural gas production and processing facilities to monitor greenhouse gas emissions beginning in 2011 and to report those emissions beginning in 2012, with the first year’s reporting deadline being extended to September 28, 2012. While we do not operate stationary sources that emit significant quantities of greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, we do utilize gas processing plants to process the natural gas that we produce and, thus if such processors were to incur increased costs to acquire and surrender emission allowances or otherwise to capture and dispose of greenhouse gases, it is possible that these costs, which might be significant, could be passed along to us as well as similarly situated producers. Moreover, any adoption of a program to tax the emission of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases potentially could be imposed on us and other similarly situated producers of natural gas. Although it is not possible at this time to predict how legislation or new regulations that may be adopted to address greenhouse gas emissions would impact our business, any such future laws and regulations could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions, and could have a    17    Table of Contents  material adverse effect on our business or demand for our products. Given the possible impact of legislation and/or regulation of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases, we have considered and expect to continue to consider the impact of laws or regulations intended to address climate change on our operations. Under the new regulations, our operations require reporting or monitoring of carbon dioxide emissions. Since our emissions are minimal, we do not expect this to have a material effect on our operations. In addition, we also operate mobile equipment in the normal course of our business that emits carbon dioxide as well as some stationary engines that power compressors and pumping equipment. Methane is a primary constituent of natural gas and, like all oil and gas exploration and production companies, we produce significant quantities of natural gas; however, such production of natural gas, including its constituent hydrocarbon methane, is gathered and transported in pipelines under pressure and we therefore do not emit significant quantities of methane in connection with our operations. Given our lack of significant points of carbon dioxide emissions, we have focused most of our efforts on physical environmental ground, water and air issues in our operations.  We are also subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, as amended (“OSHA”), and comparable state laws that regulate the protection of the health and safety of employees. In addition, OSHA’s hazard communication standard requires that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens. We believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with the OSHA requirements.  The federal Safe Drinking Water Act, as amended (“SDWA”) and comparable state laws regulate the nation’s public drinking water supply by regulating “public water systems” as well as underground sources of drinking water. Under the SDWA, EPA sets standards for drinking water quality and oversees the states, localities and water suppliers that implement those standards. The U.S. Senate and House of Representatives are currently considering bills entitled, the “Fracturing Responsibility and Awareness of Chemicals Act,” or the FRAC Act, to amend SDWA to repeal an exemption from regulation for hydraulic fracturing. Hydraulic fracturing is an important and commonly used process involving the injection of water, sand and small amounts of chemical additives under pressure into rock formations to stimulate oil or natural gas production. Sponsors of these bills have asserted that chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely affect drinking water supplies. The proposed legislation would require the reporting and public disclosure of chemicals used in the fracturing process, which could result in third parties opposing the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings based on allegations that specific chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely affect groundwater. In addition, these bills, if adopted, could establish an additional level of regulation at the federal level that could lead to operational delays or increased operating costs and could result in additional regulatory burdens that could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing and increase our costs of compliance and doing business as well as delay the development of unconventional gas resources from shale formations which are not commercial without the use of hydraulic fracturing.  The federal Endangered Species Act, as amended, restricts activities that may affect endangered and threatened species or their habitats. If endangered species are located in an area where we wish to conduct seismic surveys, development activities or abandonment operations, the work could be prohibited or delayed or expensive mitigation may be required. Moreover, the designation of previously unidentified endangered or threatened species could cause us to incur additional costs or become subject to operating restrictions or bans in the affected areas. For example, as a result of a settlement approved by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on September 9, 2011, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is required to make a determination over the next six years on the listing of more than 250 species as endangered or threatened under the Endangered Species Act. The designation of previously unprotected species in areas where we operate as threatened or endangered could cause us to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures or could result in limitations on our exploration and production activities that could have an adverse impact on our ability to develop and produce our reserves.  In summary, we believe we are in substantial compliance with currently applicable environmental laws and regulations. Although we have not experienced any material adverse effect from compliance with environmental requirements, there is no assurance that this will continue. We did not have any material capital or other non-recurring expenditures in connection with complying with environmental laws or environmental remediation matters in 2011, nor do we anticipate that such expenditures will be material in 2012. However, we regularly have expenditures to comply with environmental laws and those costs continue to increase as our operations expand.    18    Table of Contents   ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS  We are subject to various risks and uncertainties in the course of our business. The following summarizes the known material risks and uncertainties, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our business could also be impacted by additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial.  Risks Related to Our Business  Volatility of natural gas and oil prices significantly affects our cash flow and capital resources and could hamper our ability to produce natural gas, NGLs and oil economically  Natural gas, NGLs and oil prices are volatile, and a decline in prices adversely affects our profitability and financial condition. The oil and gas industry is typically cyclical, and prices for natural gas, NGLs and oil have been volatile. Over the past four years, the average NYMEX monthly settlement price of natural gas has been as high as $13.10 per mcf and as low as $2.84 mcf. During that same time frame, the oil settlement price was as high as $134.62 per barrel and as low as $33.87 per barrel. As of the end of January 2012, natural gas was $2.68 per mcf and oil was $98.46 per barrel. Natural gas prices are likely to affect us more than oil prices because approximately 79% of our December 31, 2011 proved reserves are natural gas. Natural gas prices are approaching historical lows. Historically, the industry has experienced downturns characterized by oversupply and/or weak demand. Long-term supply and demand for natural gas, NGLs and oil is uncertain and subject to a myriad of factors such as:        •    the domestic and foreign supply of natural gas, NGLs and oil;        •    the price, availability and demand for alternative fuels and sources of energy;        •    weather conditions;        •    the level of consumer demand for natural gas, NGLs and oil;        •    the price and level of foreign imports;        •    U.S. domestic and worldwide economic conditions;        •    the availability, proximity and capacity of transportation facilities and processing facilities;        •    the effect of worldwide energy conservation efforts;        •    political conditions in natural gas and oil producing regions; and        •    domestic (federal, state and local) and foreign governmental regulations and taxes.  Lower natural gas, NGL and oil prices may not only decrease our revenues on a per unit basis but also may reduce the amount of natural gas, NGL and oil that we can economically produce. A reduction in production could result in a shortfall in expected cash flows and require a reduction in capital spending or require additional borrowing. Without the ability to fund capital expenditures, we would be unable to replace reserves which would negatively affect our future rate of growth.  Producing natural gas, NGLs and oil may involve unprofitable efforts. As of December 31, 2011, the relationship between the price of oil and the price of natural gas is at an unprecedented spread. Normally, natural gas liquids production is a by-product of natural gas production. Due to the current differences in prices, we and other producers may choose to sell natural gas at below cost, or otherwise dispose of natural gas to allow for the sale of only natural gas liquids.  Information concerning our reserves and future net cash flow estimates is uncertain  There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved natural gas and oil reserves and their values, including many factors beyond our control. Estimates of proved reserves are by their nature uncertain. Although we believe these estimates are reasonable, actual production, revenues and costs to develop will likely vary from estimates and these variances could be material.  Reserve estimation is a subjective process that involves estimating volumes to be recovered from underground accumulations of natural gas and oil that cannot be directly measured. As a result, different petroleum engineers, each using industry-accepted geologic and engineering practices and scientific methods, may calculate different estimates of reserves and future net cash flows based on the same available data. Because of the subjective nature of natural gas, NGLs and oil reserve estimates, each of the following items may differ materially from the amounts or other factors estimated:    19    Table of Contents     •    the amount and timing of natural gas, NGL and oil production;        •    the revenues and costs associated with that production; and        •    the amount and timing of future development expenditures.  The discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves included in this report should not be considered as the market value of the reserves attributable to our properties. As required by generally accepted accounting principles, the estimated discounted future net revenues from our proved reserves are based on a twelve month average price (first day of the month) while cost estimates are as of the end of the year. Actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower. In addition, the 10 percent discount factor that is required to be used to calculate discounted future net revenues for reporting purposes under generally accepted accounting principles is not necessarily the most appropriate discount factor based on the cost of capital in effect from time to time and risks associated with our business and the oil and gas industry in general.  If natural gas, NGL and oil prices decrease or drilling efforts are unsuccessful, we may be required to record writedowns of our natural gas and oil properties  In the past we have been required to write down the carrying value of certain of our natural gas and oil properties, and there is a risk that we will be required to take additional writedowns in the future. Writedowns may occur when natural gas and oil prices are low, or if we have downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves, increases in our estimates of operating or development costs, deterioration in our drilling results or mechanical problems with wells where the cost to redrill or repair is not supported by the expected economics.  Accounting rules require that the carrying value of natural gas and oil properties be periodically reviewed for possible impairment. Impairment is recognized for the excess of book value over fair value when the book value of a proven property is greater than the expected undiscounted future net cash flows from that property and on acreage when conditions indicate the carrying value is not recoverable. We may be required to write down the carrying value of a property based on natural gas and oil prices at the time of the impairment review, or as a result of continuing evaluation of drilling results, production data, economics, divestiture activity, and other factors. While an impairment charge reflects our long-term ability to recover an investment, it does not impact cash or cash flow from operating activities, but it does reduce our reported earnings and increases our leverage ratios.  Significant capital expenditures are required to replace our reserves  Our exploration, development and acquisition activities require substantial capital expenditures. Historically, we have funded our capital expenditures through a combination of cash flow from operations, our bank credit facility and debt and equity issuances. We have also engaged in asset monetization transactions. Future cash flows are subject to a number of variables, such as the level of production from existing wells, prices of natural gas, NGL and oil and our success in developing and producing new reserves. If our access to capital were limited due to numerous factors, which could include a decrease in revenues due to lower natural gas, NGLs and oil prices or decreased production or deterioration of the credit and capital markets, we would have a reduced ability to replace our reserves. We may not be able to incur additional bank debt, issue debt or equity, engage in asset monetization or access other methods of financing on an economic basis to meet our reserve replacement requirements.  The amount available for borrowing under our bank credit facility is subject to a borrowing base, which is determined by our lenders, at their discretion, taking into account our estimated proved reserves and is subject to periodic redeterminations based on pricing models determined by the lenders at such time. Declines in natural gas, NGL and oil prices adversely impact the value of our estimated proved reserves and, in turn, the market values used by our lenders to determine our borrowing base. If commodity prices (particularly natural gas prices) continue to decline, it will have similar adverse effects on our reserves and borrowing base.  Our future success depends on our ability to replace reserves that we produce  Because the rate of production from natural gas and oil properties generally declines as reserves are depleted, our future success depends upon our ability to economically find or acquire and produce additional natural gas, NGL and oil reserves. Except to the extent that we acquire additional properties containing proved reserves, conduct successful exploration and development activities or, through engineering studies, identify additional behind-pipe zones or secondary recovery reserves, our proved reserves will decline as reserves are produced. Future natural gas, NGL and oil production, therefore, is highly dependent upon our level of success in acquiring or finding additional reserves that are economically recoverable. We cannot assure you that we will be able to find or acquire and develop additional reserves at an acceptable cost.    20    Table of Contents We acquire significant amounts of unproved property to further our development efforts. Development and exploratory drilling and production activities are subject to many risks, including the risk that no commercially productive reservoirs will be discovered. We acquire both producing and unproved properties as well as lease undeveloped acreage that we believe will enhance growth potential and increase our earnings over time. However, we cannot assure you that all prospects will be economically viable or that we will not abandon our initial investments. Additionally, there can be no assurance that unproved property acquired by us or undeveloped acreage leased by us will be profitably developed, that new wells drilled by us in prospects that we pursue will be productive or that we will recover all or any portion of our investment in such unproved property or wells.  Our indebtedness could limit our ability to successfully operate our business  We are leveraged and our exploration and development program will require substantial capital resources depending on the level of drilling and the expected cost of services. Our existing operations will also require ongoing capital expenditures. In addition, if we decide to pursue additional acquisitions, our capital expenditures will increase, both to complete such acquisitions and to explore and develop any newly acquired properties.  The degree to which we are leveraged could have other important consequences, including the following:        •    we may be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to the payment of our indebtedness, reducing the funds available for our operations;        •    a portion of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest, making us vulnerable to increases in interest rates;        •    we may be more highly leveraged than some of our competitors, which could place us at a competitive disadvantage;        •    our degree of leverage may make us more vulnerable to a downturn in our business or the general economy;        •    we are subject to numerous financial and other restrictive covenants contained in our existing credit agreements the breach of which could materially and adversely impact our financial performance;        •    our debt level could limit our flexibility to grow the business and in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; and        •    we may have difficulties borrowing money in the future.  Despite our current levels of indebtedness, we still may be able to incur substantially more debt. This could further increase the risks described above. In addition to those risks above, we may not be able to obtain funding on acceptable terms.  Our business is subject to operating hazards that could result in substantial losses or liabilities that may not be fully covered under our insurance policies  Natural gas, NGL and oil operations are subject to many risks, including well blowouts, craterings, explosions, uncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas or well fluids, fires, formations with abnormal pressures, pipeline ruptures or spills, pollution, releases of toxic gases and other environmental hazards and risks. If any of these hazards occur, we could sustain substantial losses as a result of:        •    injury or loss of life;        •    severe damage to or destruction of property, natural resources and equipment;        •    pollution or other environmental damage;        •    clean-up responsibilities;        •    regulatory investigations and penalties; or        •    suspension of operations.  We maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these potential risks and losses. We may elect not to obtain insurance if we believe that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented. We have experienced substantial increases in premiums, especially in areas affected by hurricanes and tropical storms. Insurers have imposed revised limits affecting how much the insurers will pay on actual storm claims plus the cost to re-drill wells where substantial damage has been incurred. Insurers are also requiring us to retain larger deductibles and reducing the scope of what insurable losses will include. Even with the increase in future insurance premiums, coverage will be reduced, requiring us to bear a greater potential risk if our natural gas and oil properties are damaged. In addition, pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable. If a significant accident or other event occurs that is not fully covered by insurance, it could have a material adverse affect on our financial condition and results of operations.    21    Table of Contents Additionally, we rely to a large extent on facilities owned and operated by third parties, and damage to or destruction of those third-party facilities could affect our ability to produce, transport and sell our production. We maintain business interruption insurance related to a third party processing plant in Pennsylvania where we are insured for potential losses from the interruption of production caused by loss of or damage to the processing plant.  We are subject to financing and interest rate exposure risks  Our business and operating results can be harmed by factors such as the availability, terms of and cost of capital, increases in interest rates or a reduction in our credit rating. These changes could cause our cost of doing business to increase, limit our ability to pursue acquisition opportunities, reduce cash flow used for drilling and place us at a competitive disadvantage. For example, at December 31, 2011, approximately 91% of our debt is at fixed interest rates with the remaining 9% subject to variable interest rates.  Continuing disruptions and volatility in the global finance markets may lead to a contraction in credit availability impacting our ability to finance our operations. We require continued access to capital; a significant reduction in cash flows from operations or the availability of credit could materially and adversely affect our ability to achieve our planned growth and operating results. We are exposed to some credit risk related to our bank credit facility to the extent that one or more of our lenders may be unable to provide necessary funding to us under our existing revolving line of credit if it experiences liquidity problems.  Difficult conditions in the global capital markets, the credit markets and the economy in general may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations  Access to capital is essential to our business. Global financial markets have been disrupted while volatile and economic conditions remain weak. As a result of concerns about the stability of financial markets in general and the solvency of counterparties specifically, access to credit markets has become less predictable, as many lenders and institutional investors have increased interest rates, enacted tighter lending standards and limited the amount of funding available to borrowers. As a result, we may be unable to obtain adequate funding under our current credit facility because (i) our lending counterparties may be unwilling or unable to meet their funding obligations or (ii) the amount we may borrow under our current credit facility could be reduced as a result of lower natural gas, NGLs or oil prices, declines in reserves, stricter lending requirements or regulations, or for other reasons.  Due to these factors, we cannot be certain that funding will be available on acceptable terms, or at all. If funding is not available when needed, or is available only on unfavorable terms, we may be unable to implement our business plans take advantage of business opportunities, or respond to competitive pressures, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our production, revenues and results of operations.  Hedging transactions may limit our potential gains and involve other risks  To manage our exposure to price risk, we currently and may in the future enter into derivative arrangements, utilizing commodity derivatives with respect to a portion of our future production. The goal of these hedges is to lock in prices so as to limit volatility and increase the predictability of cash flow. These transactions limit our potential gains if natural gas, NGLs and oil prices rise above the price established by the hedge.  In addition, derivative transactions may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including instances in which:        •    our production is less than expected;        •    the counterparties to our futures contracts fail to perform on their contract obligations; or        •    an event materially impacts natural gas, NGL or oil prices or the relationship between the hedged price index and the natural gas or oil sales price.  We cannot assure you that any derivative transaction we may enter into will adequately protect us from declines in the prices of natural gas, NGLs or oil. On the other hand, where we choose not to engage in derivative transactions in the future, we may be more adversely affected by changes in natural gas, NGLs or oil prices than our competitors who engage in derivative transactions.    22    Table of Contents The recent adoption of derivatives legislation by the United States Congress could have an adverse effect on our ability to use derivative instruments to reduce the effect of commodity price, interest rate and other risks associated with our business.  The United States Congress adopted comprehensive financial reform legislation that establishes federal oversight and regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market and entities, such as us, that participate in that market. The new legislation, known as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Act”), was signed into law by the President on July 21, 2010 and requires the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (the “CFTC”) and the SEC to promulgate rules and regulations implementing the new legislation within 360 days from the date of enactment, though final rules have yet to be issued. In its rulemaking under the Act, the CFTC has proposed regulations to set position limits for certain futures and options contracts in the major energy markets and for swaps that are their economic equivalents. Certain bona fide hedging transactions or positions would be exempt from these position limits. It is not possible at this time to predict when the CFTC will finalize these regulations. The financial reform legislation may also require us to comply with margin requirements and with certain clearing and trade-execution requirements in connection with our derivative activities, although the application of those provisions to us is uncertain at this time. The financial reform legislation may also require the counterparties to our derivative instruments to spin off some of their derivatives activities to a separate entity, which may not be as creditworthy as the current counterparty. The new legislation and any new regulations could significantly increase the cost of derivative contracts (including requirements to post collateral which could adversely affect our available liquidity), materially alter the terms of derivative contracts, reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against risks that we encounter, reduce our ability to monetize or restructure our existing derivative contracts, and increase our exposure to less creditworthy counterparties. If we reduce our use of derivatives as a result of the legislation and regulations, our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable, which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures. Our revenues could therefore be adversely affected if a consequence of the legislation and regulations is to lower commodity prices. Any of these consequences could have a material, adverse effect on us, our financial condition, and our results of operations.  Many of our current and potential competitors have greater resources than we have and we may not be able to successfully compete in acquiring, exploring and developing new properties  We face competition in every aspect of our business, including, but not limited to, acquiring reserves and leases, obtaining goods, services and employees needed to operate and manage our business and marketing natural gas, NGLs or oil. Competitors include multinational oil companies, independent production companies and individual producers and operators. Many of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do. As a result, these competitors may be able to address these competitive factors more effectively than we can or weather industry downturns more easily than we can.  The demand for field services and their ability to meet that demand may limit our ability to drill and produce our natural gas and oil properties  In a rising price environment, such as those experienced in 2007 and early 2008, well service providers and related equipment and personnel were in short supply. This caused escalating prices, the possibility of poor services coupled with potential damage to downhole reservoirs and personnel injuries. Such pressures increased the actual cost of services, extended the time to secure such services and added costs for damages due to accidents sustained from the over use of equipment and inexperienced personnel. In some cases, we are operating in areas where services and infrastructure are limited, or do not exist or in urban areas which are more restrictive.  A change in the jurisdictional characterization of some of our assets by federal, state or local regulatory agencies or a change in policy by those agencies may result in increased regulation of our assets, which may cause our revenues to decline and operating expenses to increase  Section 1(b) of the Natural Gas Act of 1938 (“NGA”) exempts natural gas gathering facilities from regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) as a natural gas company under the NGA. We believe that the natural gas pipelines in our gathering systems meet the traditional tests FERC has used to establish a pipeline’s status as a gatherer not subject to regulation as a natural gas company. However, the distinction between FERC-regulated transmission services and federally unregulated gathering services is the subject of ongoing litigation, so the classification and regulation of our gathering facilities are subject to change based on future determinations by FERC, the courts, or Congress.  While our natural gas gathering operations are generally exempt from FERC regulation under the NGA, our gas gathering operations may be subject to certain FERC reporting and posting requirements in a given year. FERC has issued a final rule requiring certain participants in the natural gas market, including certain gathering facilities and natural gas marketers that engage in a minimum level of natural gas sales or purchases, to submit annual reports to FERC on the aggregate volumes of natural gas purchased or sold at wholesale in the prior calendar year to the extent such transactions utilize, contribute to, or may contribute to, the formation of price indices. In addition, FERC has issued a final rule requiring major non-interstate    23    Table of Contents  pipelines, defined as certain non-interstate pipelines delivering more than an average of 50 million MMBtu of gas over the previous three calendar years, to post daily, certain information regarding the pipeline’s capacity and scheduled flows for each receipt and delivery point that has design capacity equal to or greater than 15,000 MMBtu per day.  Other FERC regulations may indirectly impact our businesses and the markets for products derived from these businesses. FERC’s policies and practices across the range of its natural gas regulatory activities, including, for example, its policies on open access transportation, gas quality, ratemaking, capacity release and market center promotion, may indirectly affect the intrastate natural gas market. In recent years, FERC has pursued pro-competitive policies in its regulation of interstate natural gas pipelines. However, we cannot assure you that FERC will continue this approach as it considers matters such as pipelines rates and rules and policies that may affect rights of access to transportation capacity. For more information regarding the regulation of our operations, please see “Government Regulation” in Items 1 and 2 of this report.  Should we fail to comply with all applicable FERC administered statutes, rules, regulations and orders, we could be subject to substantial penalties and fines  Under the Energy Policy Act of 2005, FERC has civil penalty authority under the NGA to impose penalties for current violations of up to $1 million per day for each violation and disgorgement of profits associated with any violation. While our operations have not been regulated as a natural gas company by FERC under the NGA, FERC has adopted regulations that may subject certain of our otherwise non-FERC jurisdiction facilities to FERC annual reporting and daily scheduled flow and capacity posting requirements. We also must comply with the anti-market manipulation rules enforced by FERC. Additional rules and legislation pertaining to those and other matters may be considered or adopted by FERC from time to time. Failure to comply with those regulations in the future could subject Range to civil penalty liability. For more information regarding regulation of our operations, please see “Government Regulation” in Items 1 and 2 of this report.  The natural gas and oil industry is subject to extensive regulation  The natural gas and oil industry is subject to various types of regulations in the United States by local, state and federal agencies. Legislation affecting the industry is under constant review for amendment or expansion, frequently increasing our regulatory burden. Numerous departments and agencies, both state and federal, are authorized by statute to issue rules and regulations binding on participants in the natural gas and oil industry. Compliance with such rules and regulations often increases our cost of doing business, delays our operations and, in turn, decreases our profitability.  Our operations are subject to numerous and increasingly strict federal, state and local laws, regulations and enforcement policies relating to the environment. We may incur significant costs and liabilities in complying with existing or future environmental laws, regulations and enforcement policies and may incur costs arising out of property or natural resource damage or injuries to employees and other persons. These costs may result from our current and former operations and even may be caused by previous owners of property we own or lease or relate to third party sites where we have taken materials for recycling or disposal. Any past, present or future failure by us to completely comply with environmental laws, regulations and enforcement policies could cause us to incur substantial fines, sanctions or liabilities from cleanup costs or other damages. Incurrence of those costs or damages could reduce or eliminate funds available for exploration, development or acquisitions or cause us to incur losses. Matters subject to regulation include:        •    the amounts and types of substances and materials that may be released into the environment;        •    response to unexpected releases to the environment;        •    reports and permits concerning exploration, drilling, production and other operations;        •    the spacing of wells;        •    unitization and pooling of properties;        •    calculating royalties on oil and gas produced under federal and state leases; and        •    taxation.  Under these laws, we could be liable for personal injuries, property damage, oil spills, discharge of hazardous materials, remediation and clean-up costs, natural resource damages and other environmental damages. We also could be required to install expensive pollution control measures or limit or cease activities on lands located within wilderness, wetlands or other environmentally or politically sensitive areas. Failure to comply with these laws also may result in the suspension or termination of our operations and subject us to administrative, civil and criminal penalties as well as the imposition of corrective action orders.    24    Table of Contents Climate change is receiving increasing attention from scientists, legislators and governmental agencies. There is an ongoing debate as to the extent to which our climate is changing, the potential causes of this change and its potential impacts. Some attribute global warming to increased levels of greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide and methane, which has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions.  There are a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to address greenhouse gas emissions, which are in various phases of discussion or implementation. The outcome of federal and state actions to address global climate change could result in a variety of regulatory programs including potential new regulations to control or restrict emissions, taxes or other charges to deter emissions of greenhouse gases, energy efficiency requirements to reduce demand, or other regulatory actions. These actions could:        •    result in increased costs associated with our operations;        •    increase other costs to our business;        •    affect the demand for natural gas; and        •    impact the prices we charge our customers.  Adoption of federal or state requirements mandating a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions could have far-reaching and significant impacts on the energy industry and the U.S. economy. We cannot predict the potential impact of such laws or regulations on our future consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. For more information regarding the environmental regulation of our business, see “Environment and Occupational Health and Safety Matters” in Items 1 and 2 of this report.  Certain federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to natural gas and oil exploration and development may be eliminated, and additional state taxes on natural gas extraction may be imposed, as a result of future legislation.  Legislation has been proposed that would, if enacted into law, make significant changes to U.S. federal income tax laws, including the elimination of certain U.S. federal income tax benefits currently available to oil and gas exploration and production companies. Such changes include, but are not limited to, (i) the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and gas properties; (ii) the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs; (iii) the elimination of the deduction for certain U.S. production activities; and (iv) an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures. It is unclear, however, whether any such changes will be enacted or how soon such changes could be effective. As of December 31, 2011, we had a tax basis of $1.4 billion related to prior year capitalized intangible drilling costs, which will be amortized over the next five years.  The passage of this legislation or any other similar change in U.S. federal income tax law could eliminate or postpone certain tax deductions that are currently available with respect to natural gas and oil exploration and development, and any such change could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.  In February 2012, the state legislature of Pennsylvania passed a new natural gas impact fee in Pennsylvania, where the majority of our acreage in the Marcellus Shale is located. The legislation imposes an annual fee on natural gas and oil operators for each well drilled for a period of fifteen years. The fee is on a sliding scale set by the Public Utility Commission and is based on two factors: changes in the Consumer Price Index and the average New York Mercantile Exchange’s natural gas prices from the last day of each month. The estimated total fees per well based on today’s current natural gas price is $240,000 over the 15 year period. The passage of this legislation increases the financial burden on our operations in the Marcellus Shale.  Acquisitions are subject to the risks and uncertainties of evaluating reserves and potential liabilities and may be disruptive and difficult to integrate into our business  We could be subject to significant liabilities related to our acquisitions. It generally is not feasible to review in detail every individual property included in an acquisition. Ordinarily, a review is focused on higher valued properties. However, even a detailed review of all properties and records may not reveal existing or potential problems in all of the properties, nor will it permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to assess fully their deficiencies and capabilities. We do not always inspect every well we acquire, and environmental problems, such as groundwater contamination, are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is performed.  In addition, there is intense competition for acquisition opportunities in our industry. Competition for acquisitions may increase the cost of, or cause us to refrain from, completing acquisitions. Our acquisition strategy is dependent upon, among other things, our ability to obtain debt and equity financing and, in some cases, regulatory approvals. Our ability to pursue our acquisition strategy may be hindered if we are unable to obtain financing on terms acceptable to us or regulatory approvals.    25    Table of Contents Acquisitions often pose integration risks and difficulties. In connection with recent and future acquisitions, the process of integrating acquired operations into our existing operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and may require significant management attention and financial resources that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of existing operations. Future acquisitions could result in our incurring additional debt, contingent liabilities, expenses and diversion of resources, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results.  Our success depends on key members of our management and our ability to attract and retain experienced technical and other professional personnel  Our success is highly dependent on our management personnel and none of them is currently subject to an employment contract. The loss of one or more of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business. Furthermore, competition for experienced technical and other professional personnel remains strong. If we cannot retain our current personnel or attract additional experienced personnel, our ability to compete could be adversely affected. Also, the loss of experienced personnel could lead to a loss of technical expertise.  Drilling is an uncertain and costly activity  The cost of drilling, completing, and operating a well is often uncertain, and many factors can adversely affect the economics of a well. Our efforts will be uneconomical if we drill dry holes or wells that are productive but do not produce enough natural gas, NGLs and oil to be commercially viable after drilling, operating and other costs. Furthermore, our drilling and producing operations may be curtailed, delayed, or canceled as a result of other factors, including:        •    high costs, shortages or delivery delays of drilling rigs, equipment, water for hydraulic fracturing services, labor, or other services;        •    unexpected operational events and drilling conditions;        •    reductions in natural gas, NGLs and oil prices;        •    limitations in the market for natural gas, NGLs and oil;        •    adverse weather conditions;        •    facility or equipment malfunctions;        •    equipment failures or accidents;        •    title problems;        •    pipe or cement failures;        •    casing collapses;        •    compliance with, or changes in environmental, tax and other governmental requirements;        •    environmental hazards, such as natural gas leaks, oil spills, pipeline ruptures, and discharges of toxic gases;        •    lost or damaged oilfield drilling and service tools;        •    unusual or unexpected geological formations;        •    loss of drilling fluid circulation;        •    pressure or irregularities in formations;        •    fires;        •    natural disasters;        •    surface craterings and explosions; and        •    uncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas or well fluids.  If any of these factors were to occur with respect to a particular field, we could lose all or a part of our investment in the field, or we could fail to realize the expected benefits from the field, either of which could materially and adversely affect our revenue and profitability.    26    Table of Contents New technologies may cause our current exploration and drilling methods to become obsolete  The natural gas and oil industry is subject to rapid and significant advancements in technology, including the introduction of new products and services using new technologies. As competitors use or develop new technologies, we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage, and competitive pressures may force us to implement new technologies at a substantial cost. In addition, competitors may have greater financial, technical and personnel resources that allow them to enjoy technological advantages and may in the future allow them to implement new technologies before we can. One or more of the technologies that we currently use or that we may implement in the future may become obsolete. We cannot be certain that we will be able to implement technologies on a timely basis or at a cost that is acceptable to us. If we are unable to maintain technological advancements consistent with industry standards, our operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.  New legislation and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays.  Hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, sand and small amounts of additives under pressure into rock formations to stimulate hydrocarbon (natural gas and oil) production. We find that the use of hydraulic fracturing is necessary to produce commercial quantities of natural gas and oil from many reservoirs, especially shale formations such as the Marcellus Shale. The process is typically regulated by state oil and gas commissions. However, the EPA, recently asserted federal regulatory authority over hydraulic fracturing involving diesel additives under the Safe Drinking Water Act’s Underground Injection Control Program. While the EPA has begun the process of drafting guidance documents to enforce or implement this newly asserted regulatory authority, industry groups have filed suit challenging the EPA’s recent decision. There are certain governmental reviews either underway or being proposed that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices. The White House Council on Environmental Quality is coordinating an administration-wide review of hydraulic fracturing practices, and a committee of the United States House of Representatives has conducted an investigation of hydraulic fracturing practices. Furthermore, a number of federal agencies are analyzing, or have been requested to review a variety of environmental issues associated with hydraulic fracturing. The EPA has commenced a study of potential environmental effects of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water and groundwater, with initial results expected to be available by late 2012 and final results by 2014 and, more recently in October 2011, the EPA announced that it is launching a study regarding wastewater resulting from hydraulic fracturing activities and currently plans to propose standards by 2014 that such wastewater must meet before being transported to a treatment plant. Also, the U.S. Department of Energy is conducting an investigation into practices the agency could recommend to better protect the environment from drilling using hydraulic fracturing completion methods and the U.S. Department of the Interior has proposed disclosure, well testing and monitoring requirements for hydraulic fracturing on federal lands. At the same time, legislation has been introduced before Congress to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the fracturing process. In addition, some states have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, regulations that could impose more stringent permitting, disclosure and well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations. For example, Texas, Pennsylvania, Colorado, West Virginia and Wyoming have each adopted a variety of well construction, set back, or disclosure regulations limiting how fracturing can be performed and requiring various degrees of chemical disclosure. If new laws or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing are adopted, such laws could make it more difficult or costly for us to perform fracturing to stimulate production from tight formations. In addition, if hydraulic fracturing becomes regulated at the federal level as a result of federal legislation or regulatory initiatives by the EPA, our fracturing activities could become subject to additional permitting requirements and also to attendant permitting delays and potential increases in costs.  Additionally, on December 7, 2010, the EPA issued an order to us to take certain action with regard to the existence of natural gas in two water wells located in southern Parker County, Texas that the EPA concluded resulted from two of our wells in the Barnett Shale formation, thousands of feet below the impacted aquifer. On January 18, 2011, the EPA filed an action in federal court to enforce the order and its penalty provisions of up to $16,500 per day per violation. On June 24, 2011, the court issued an order staying the enforcement action, pending a ruling on Range’s challenge of the order in the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit which Range filed in January 21, 2011, seeking to invalidate the order. While we are vigorously contesting this enforcement action and seeking relief from the order in federal appeals court, we cannot predict the outcome of either the enforcement action or appeal. However, we do not believe the ultimate resolution of this matter will have a material impact on our financial position, statement of operations or cash flows. Please see “Action by the United States Environmental Protection Agency” in Item 3 of this report.  Our business depends on natural gas and oil transportation and NGL processing facilities, most of which are owned by others and our ability to contract with those parties  Our ability to sell our natural gas, NGLs and oil production depends in part on the availability, proximity and capacity of pipeline systems and processing facilities owned by third parties and our ability to contract with those third parties. The lack of available capacity on these systems and facilities could result in the shut-in of producing wells or the delay or discontinuance of development plans for properties. Although we have some contractual control over the transportation of our product, material changes in these business relationships could materially affect our operations. In some cases, we do not purchase firm transportation on third party facilities and therefore, our production transportation can be interrupted by those    27    Table of Contents  having firm arrangements. We have entered into long-term agreements with third parties to provide natural gas gathering and processing services in the Marcellus Shale. Federal and state regulation of natural gas and oil production and transportation, tax and energy policies, changes in supply and demand, pipeline pressures, damage to or destruction of pipelines and general economic conditions could adversely affect our ability to produce, gather and transport natural gas, NGLs and oil. If any of these third party pipelines and other facilities become partially or fully unavailable to transport or process our product, or if the natural gas quality specifications for a natural gas pipeline or facility changes so as to restrict our ability to transport natural gas on those pipelines or facilities, our revenues could be adversely affected.  The disruption of third-party facilities due to maintenance and/or weather could negatively impact our ability to market and deliver our products. In particular, the disruption of certain third-party natural gas processing facilities in the Marcellus Shale could materially affect our ability to market and deliver natural gas production in that area. We have no control over when or if such facilities are restored and generally have no control over what prices will be charged. A total shut-in of production could materially affect us due to a lack of cash flow, and if a substantial portion of the production is hedged at lower than market prices, those financial hedges would have to be paid from borrowings absent sufficient cash flow.  Currently, there is little demand, or facilities to supply the existing demand, for ethane in the Appalachian region so, for our Appalachian production volumes, ethane remains in the natural gas stream. We currently have waivers from two transmission pipelines that allow us to leave ethane in the residue natural gas. We currently believe the limits are sufficient to cover our production through 2014. We have recently announced two ethane agreements where we have contracted to either sell or transport ethane from our Marcellus Shale area, both to begin operations in late 2013 or early 2014. We cannot assure you that these facilities will become available. If we are not able to sell ethane in 2014, we may be required to curtail production which will adversely affect our revenues.  Any failure to meet our debt obligations could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations  If our cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt obligations, we may be forced to sell assets, seek additional equity or restructure our debt. In addition, any failure to make scheduled payments of interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness on acceptable terms. Our cash flow and capital resources may be insufficient for payment of interest on and principal of our debt in the future and any such alternative measures may be unsuccessful or may not permit us to meet scheduled debt service obligations, which could cause us to default on our obligations and impair our liquidity.  We exist in a litigious environment  Any constituent could bring suit regarding our existing or planned operations or allege a violation of an existing contract. Any such action could delay when planned operations can actually commence or could cause a halt to existing production until such alleged violations are resolved by the courts. Not only could we incur significant legal and support expenses in defending our rights, but halting existing production or delaying planned operations could impact our future operations and financial condition. Such legal disputes could also distract management and other personnel from their primary responsibilities.  Our financial statements are complex  Due to United States generally accepted accounting principles and the nature of our business, our financial statements continue to be complex, particularly with reference to hedging, asset retirement obligations, equity awards, deferred taxes, the accounting for our deferred compensation plans and discontinued operations. We expect such complexity to continue and possibly increase.  Risks Related to Our Common Stock  Common stockholders will be diluted if additional shares are issued  In 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007, we sold 48.3 million shares of common stock to finance acquisitions. In 2008, we sold 4.4 million shares of common stock with the proceeds used to pay down a portion of the outstanding balance of our bank credit facility. In 2009, we issued 744,000 shares of common stock to purchase acreage in the Marcellus Shale. In 2010, we issued 380,000 shares of common stock to purchase acreage in the Marcellus Shale. Our ability to repurchase securities for cash is limited by our bank credit facility and our senior subordinated note agreements. We also issue restricted stock and stock appreciation rights to our employees and directors as part of their compensation. In addition, we may issue additional shares of common stock, additional subordinated notes or other securities or debt convertible into common stock, to extend maturities or fund capital expenditures, including acquisitions.
