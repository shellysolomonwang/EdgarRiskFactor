Item 1A. Risk Factors.    The following discussion of risk factors contains “forward-looking statements” which are discussed immediately following Item 7A of this Form 10-K. These risk factors may be important to understanding any statement in this Form 10-K or elsewhere. The following information should be read in conjunction with Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this Form 10-K.    We urge you to carefully consider the risks described below, as well as in other reports and materials that we file with the SEC and the other information included or incorporated by reference in Form 10-K. If any of the risks described below or elsewhere in this Form 10-K were to materialize, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or prospects could be materially adversely affected. In such case, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose part or all of your investment. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.    Demand for the majority of our services is substantially dependent on the levels of expenditures by the oil and gas industry. Our customers’ capital expenditures may decline in 2010 and beyond if current global economic conditions continue or worsen. This could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.    The current global economic downturn has reduced worldwide demand for oil and natural gas and resulted in significantly lower crude oil and natural gas prices compared to their record highs in July 2008. It is difficult to predict how long the global economic downturn will continue, or to what extent this will continue to affect us. The significant decline in oil and natural gas prices reduced many of our customers’ activities and spending on our services and products in 2009; this reduction in our customers’ activities and spending could continue through 2010 and beyond. Demand for the majority of our services depends substantially on the level of expenditures by the oil and gas industry for the exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas reserves. These expenditures are sensitive to the industry’s view of future economic growth and the resulting impact on demand for oil and natural gas. The worldwide deterioration in the financial and credit markets, which began in the second half of 2008, resulted in diminished demand for oil and gas and significantly lower oil and natural gas prices. This caused many of our customers to reduce or delay their oil and gas exploration and production spending in 2009, which consequently reduced the demand for our services, and exerted downward pressure on the prices of our services and products. If the economic downturn    6    Table of Contents Part 1, Item 1A       continues for a prolonged period or if there is little or no economic growth, it will likely result in further reductions of exploration and production expenditures by our customers, causing further declines in the demand for, and prices of, our services and products. This could result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  The reduction in cash flows being experienced by our customers resulting from declines in commodity prices, together with the reduced availability of credit and increased costs of borrowing, could have significant adverse effects on the financial condition of some of our customers. This could result in project modifications, delays or cancellations, general business disruptions, and delay in, or nonpayment of, amounts that are owed to us, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.  The prices for oil and natural gas are subject to a variety of factors, including:        ·    demand for hydrocarbons, which is affected by worldwide population growth, economic growth rates and general economic and business conditions;        ·    the ability of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (“OPEC”) to set and maintain production levels for oil;        ·    oil and gas production by non-OPEC countries;        ·    the level of excess production capacity;        ·    political and economic uncertainty and sociopolitical unrest;        ·    the level of worldwide oil and gas exploration and production activity;        ·    the cost of exploring for, producing and delivering oil and gas;        ·    technological advances affecting energy consumption; and        ·    weather conditions.    A significant portion of our revenue is derived from our non-United States operations, which exposes us to risks inherent in doing business in each of the approximately 80 countries in which we operate.    Our non-United States operations accounted for approximately 84% of our consolidated revenue in 2009, 78% in 2008 and 76% in 2007. Operations in countries other than the United States are subject to various risks, including:        ·    unsettled political and economic conditions in certain areas;        ·    exposure to possible expropriation of our assets or other governmental actions;        ·    social unrest, acts of terrorism, war or other armed conflict;        ·    confiscatory taxation or other adverse tax policies;        ·    deprivation of contract rights;        ·    trade restrictions or embargoes imposed by the United States or other countries;        ·    restrictions under the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or similar legislation in other countries;        ·    restrictions on the repatriation of income or capital;        ·    currency exchange controls;        ·    inflation; and        ·    currency exchange rate fluctuations and devaluations.    7    Table of Contents Part 1, Item 1A      In addition, we are subject to risks associated with our operations in countries, including Iran, Syria, Sudan and Cuba, which are subject to trade and economic sanctions or other restrictions imposed by the United States or other governments or organizations. United States law enforcement authorities are currently conducting a grand jury investigation and an associated regulatory inquiry related to our operations in certain of these countries.  If any of the risks described above materialize, or if any governmental investigation results in criminal or civil penalties or other remedial measures, it could reduce our earnings and our cash available for operations.  We are also subject to risks related to investment in our common stock in connection with certain US state divestment or investment limitation legislation applicable to companies with operations in these countries, and similar actions by some private investors, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.    Environmental compliance costs and liabilities could reduce our earnings and cash available for operations.    We are subject to increasingly stringent laws and regulations relating to importation and use of hazardous materials, radioactive materials and explosives, environmental protection, including laws and regulations governing air emissions, water discharges and waste management. We incur, and expect to continue to incur, capital and operating costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations. The technical requirements of these laws and regulations are becoming increasingly complex, stringent and expensive to implement. These laws may provide for “strict liability” for damages to natural resources or threats to public health and safety. Strict liability can render a party liable for damages without regard to negligence or fault on the part of the party. Some environmental laws provide for joint and several strict liability for remediation of spills and releases of hazardous substances.  We use and generate hazardous substances and wastes in our operations. In addition, many of our current and former properties are, or have been, used for industrial purposes. Accordingly, we could become subject to potentially material liabilities relating to the investigation and cleanup of contaminated properties, and to claims alleging personal injury or property damage as the result of exposures to, or releases of, hazardous substances. In addition, stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations, new laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new or increased requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis of new or increased liabilities that could reduce our earnings and our cash available for operations. We believe we are currently in substantial compliance with environmental laws and regulations.    We could be subject to substantial liability claims, which would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.     Certain equipment used in the delivery of oilfield services, such as directional drilling equipment, perforating systems, subsea completion equipment, radioactive materials and explosives and well completion systems, are used in hostile environments, such as exploration, development and production applications. An accident or a failure of a product could cause personal injury, loss of life, damage to property, equipment or the environment, and suspension of operations. Our insurance may not adequately protect us against liability for some kinds of events, including events involving pollution, or against losses resulting from business interruption. Moreover, in the future we may not be able to maintain insurance at levels of risk coverage or policy limits that we deem adequate. Substantial claims made under our policies could cause our premiums to increase. Any future damages caused by our products that are not covered by insurance, or are in excess of policy limits or are subject to substantial deductibles, could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.    8    Table of Contents Part 1, Item 1A      If we are unable to maintain technology leadership in the form of services and products, this could adversely affect any competitive advantage we hold.    If we are unable to develop and produce competitive technology or deliver it to our clients in the form of services and products in a timely and cost-competitive manner in the various markets we serve, it could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.    Limitations on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights, including our trade secrets, could cause a loss in revenue and any competitive advantage we hold.    Some of our products or services, and the processes we use to produce or provide them, have been granted patent protection, have patent applications pending or are trade secrets. Our business may be adversely affected if our patents are unenforceable, the claims allowed under our patents are not sufficient to protect our technology, our patent applications are denied, or our trade secrets are not adequately protected. Our competitors may be able to develop technology independently that is similar to ours without infringing on our patents or gaining access to our trade secrets.    We may be subject to litigation if another party claims that we have infringed upon its intellectual property rights.    The tools, techniques, methodologies, programs and components we use to provide our services may infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others. Infringement claims generally result in significant legal and other costs and may distract management from running our core business. Royalty payments under licenses from third parties, if available, would increase our costs. If a license were not available we might not be able to continue providing a particular service or product, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, developing non-infringing technologies would increase our costs.    Failure to obtain and retain skilled technical personnel could impede our operations.    We require highly skilled personnel to operate and provide technical services and support for our business. Competition for the personnel required for our businesses intensifies as activity increases. In periods of high utilization it may become more difficult to find and retain qualified individuals. This could increase our costs or have other adverse effects on our operations.    Severe weather conditions may affect our operations.    Our business may be materially affected by severe weather conditions in areas where we operate. This may entail the evacuation of personnel and stoppage of services. In addition, if particularly severe weather affects platforms or structures, this may result in a suspension of activities until the platforms or structures have been repaired. Any of these events could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.    9    Table of Contents Part 1, Item 1B, 2, 3, 4      Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments
