Item 1A. Risk Factors Related to Our Business and Operations   Our business activities and the value of our securities are subject to significant risk factors, including those described below. The risk factors described below could negatively affect our operations, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations, and as a result, holders and purchasers of our securities could lose part or all of their investments. It is possible that additional risks relating to our securities may be described in a prospectus supplement if we issue securities in the future.  Our business and operating results are highly dependent on the market prices of crude oil, natural gas, refined petroleum products and electricity, which can be very volatile. Our estimated proved reserves, revenue, operating cash flows, operating margins, future earnings and trading operations are highly dependent on the prices of crude oil, natural gas, refined petroleum products and electricity, which are volatile and influenced by numerous factors beyond our control. Changes in commodity prices can also have a material impact on collateral and margin requirements under our derivative contracts. The major foreign oil producing countries, including members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), exert considerable influence over the supply and price of crude oil and refined petroleum products. Their ability or inability to agree on a common policy on rates of production and other matters has a significant impact on the oil markets. The commodities trading markets as well as other supply and demand factors may also influence the selling prices of crude oil, natural gas, refined petroleum products and electricity. To the extent that we engage in hedging activities to mitigate commodity price volatility, we may not realize the benefit of price increases above the hedged price. In order to manage the potential volatility of cash flows and credit requirements, the Corporation utilizes significant bank credit facilities. An inability to renew or replace such credit facilities or access other sources of funding as they mature would negatively impact our liquidity.  If we fail to successfully increase our reserves, our future crude oil and natural gas production will be adversely impacted. We own or have access to a finite amount of oil and gas reserves which will be depleted over time. Replacement of oil and gas production and reserves, including proved undeveloped reserves, is subject to successful exploration drilling, development activities, and enhanced recovery programs. Therefore, future oil and gas production is dependent on technical success in finding and developing additional hydrocarbon reserves. Exploration activity involves the interpretation of seismic and other geological and geophysical data, which does not always successfully predict the presence of commercial quantities of hydrocarbons. Drilling risks include unexpected adverse conditions, irregularities in pressure or formations, equipment failure, blowouts and weather interruptions. Future developments may be affected by unforeseen reservoir conditions which negatively affect recovery factors or flow rates. The costs of drilling and development activities have increased in recent years which could negatively affect expected economic returns. Reserve replacement can also be achieved through acquisition. Although due diligence is used in evaluating acquired oil and gas properties, similar risks may be encountered in the production of oil and gas on properties acquired from others.  There are inherent uncertainties in estimating quantities of proved reserves and discounted future net cash flow, and actual quantities may be lower than estimated. Numerous uncertainties exist in estimating quantities of proved reserves and future net revenues from those reserves. Actual future production, oil and gas prices, revenues, taxes, capital expenditures, operating expenses, and quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves may vary substantially from those assumed in the estimates and could materially affect the estimated quantities of our proved reserves and the related future net revenues. In addition, reserve estimates may be subject to downward or upward changes based on production performance, purchases or sales of properties, results of future development, prevailing oil and gas prices, production sharing contracts, which may decrease reserves as crude oil and natural gas prices increase, and other factors.  We are subject to changing laws and regulations and other governmental actions that can significantly and adversely affect our business. Federal, state, local, territorial and foreign laws and regulations relating to tax increases and retroactive tax claims, disallowance of tax credits and deductions, expropriation or nationalization of property, mandatory government participation, cancellation or amendment of contract rights, and changes in import and export regulations, limitations on access to exploration and development opportunities, as well as other political developments may affect our operations. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform Act, enacted in 2010, delegated rulemaking responsibilities to carry out the Act to various U.S. government agencies. Our business could potentially be adversely impacted by one or more of the final    14    Table of Contents  rules under this Act, when issued, including potential additional costs to engage in certain derivative transactions. We also market motor fuels through lessee-dealers and wholesalers in certain states where legislation prohibits producers or refiners of crude oil from directly engaging in retail marketing of motor fuels. Similar legislation has been periodically proposed in various other states. As a result of the accident in April 2010 at the BP p.l.c. (BP) operated Macondo prospect in the Gulf of Mexico (in which the Corporation was not a participant) and the ensuing significant oil spill, a temporary drilling moratorium was imposed in the Gulf of Mexico. While this moratorium has since been lifted, significant new regulations have been imposed and further legislation and regulations may be proposed, including an increase in the potential liability in the event of an oil spill. The new regulatory environment has resulted in a longer permitting process and higher costs.  Political instability in areas where we operate can adversely affect our business. Some of the international areas in which we operate, and the partners with whom we operate, are politically less stable than other areas and partners. Political unrest in North Africa and the Middle East has affected and may continue to affect our operations in these areas as well as oil and gas markets generally. The threat of terrorism around the world also poses additional risks to the operations of the oil and gas industry.  Our oil and gas operations are subject to environmental risks and environmental laws and regulations that can result in significant costs and liabilities. Our oil and gas operations, like those of the industry, are subject to environmental risks such as oil spills, produced water spills, gas leaks and ruptures and discharges of substances or gases that could expose us to substantial liability for pollution or other environmental damage. For example, the accident at the BP operated Macondo prospect in April 2010 resulted in a significant release of crude oil which caused extensive environmental and economic damage. Our operations are also subject to numerous United States federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations. Non-compliance with these laws and regulations may subject us to administrative, civil or criminal penalties, remedial clean-ups and natural resource damages or other liabilities. In addition, increasingly stringent environmental regulations, particularly relating to the production of motor and other fuels, have resulted and will likely continue to result in higher capital expenditures and operating expenses for us and the oil and gas industry in general.  Concerns have been raised in certain jurisdictions where we have operations concerning the safety and environmental impact of the drilling and development of unconventional oil and gas resources, particularly using the process of hydraulic fracturing. While we believe that these operations can be conducted safely and with minimal impact on the environment, regulatory bodies are responding to these concerns and may impose moratoriums and new regulations on such drilling operations that would likely have the effect of prohibiting or delaying such operations and increasing their cost. For example, a moratorium prohibiting hydraulic fracturing is currently impacting the Corporationâ€™s operations in France.  Concerns about climate change may result in significant operational changes and expenditures and reduced demand for our products. We recognize that climate change is a global environmental concern. Continuing political and social attention to the issue of climate change has resulted in both existing and pending international agreements and national, regional or local legislation and regulatory measures to limit greenhouse gas emissions. These agreements and measures may require significant equipment modifications, operational changes, taxes, or purchase of emission credits to reduce emission of greenhouse gases from our operations, which may result in substantial capital expenditures and compliance, operating, maintenance and remediation costs. In addition, we manufacture petroleum fuels, which through normal customer use result in the emission of greenhouse gases. Regulatory initiatives to reduce the use of these fuels may reduce our sales of, and revenues from, these products. Finally, to the extent that climate change may result in more extreme weather related events, we could experience increased costs related to prevention, maintenance and remediation of affected operations in addition to costs and lost revenues related to delays and shutdowns.  Our industry is highly competitive and many of our competitors are larger and have greater resources than we have. The petroleum industry is highly competitive and very capital intensive. We encounter competition from numerous companies in each of our activities, including acquiring rights to explore for crude oil and natural gas, and in purchasing and marketing of refined petroleum products, natural gas and electricity. Many competitors, including national oil companies, are larger and have substantially greater resources. We are also in competition with producers and marketers of other forms of energy. Increased competition for worldwide oil and gas assets has significantly increased the cost of acquisitions. In addition,    15    Table of Contents  competition for drilling services, technical expertise and equipment has, in the recent past, affected the availability of technical personnel and drilling rigs, resulting in increased capital and operating costs.  Catastrophic events, whether naturally occurring or man-made, may materially affect our operations and financial conditions. Our oil and gas operations are subject to unforeseen occurrences which have affected us from time to time and which may damage or destroy assets, interrupt operations and have other significant adverse effects. Examples of catastrophic risks include hurricanes, fires, explosions and blowouts, such as the accident at the Macondo prospect operated by BP in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. Although we maintain insurance coverage against property and casualty losses, there can be no assurance that such insurance will adequately protect the Corporation against liability from all potential consequences and damages. Moreover, some forms of insurance may be unavailable in the future or be available only on terms that are deemed economically unacceptable.  Item 3. Legal Proceedings
