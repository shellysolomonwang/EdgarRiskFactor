Item 1A. Risk Factors within this document.       1  Glossary Throughout this report, the following company or industry specific terms and abbreviations are used: Appraisal well – An exploration well drilled to confirm the results of a discovery well, or a well used to determine the boundaries of a productive formation. Bbl – One stock tank barrel, which is 42 United States gallons liquid volume. Barrel of oil equivalent or Boe – This reflects natural gas reserves converted on the basis of relative energy content of six mcf equals one barrel of oil equivalent (one mcf represents one thousand cubic feet). Barrel of oil equivalence does not necessarily result in price equivalence, as the equivalent price of natural gas on a barrel of oil equivalent basis has been substantially lower than the corresponding price for crude oil over the recent past. See the average selling prices in the table on page 9. Boepd – Barrels of oil equivalent per day. Bopd – Barrels of oil per day. Carried interest – An interest in an oil and gas property where the carrying party agrees to pay for all or part of development and operating costs of another party. The carrying party may then recover a specified amount of costs from the other party’s share of any hydrocarbon revenues. Condensate – A mixture of hydrocarbons that exists in the gaseous phase at original reservoir temperature and pressure, but that, when produced, is in the liquid phase at surface pressure and temperature. Development well – A well drilled within the proved area of an oil and/or natural gas reservoir with the intent of producing oil and/or natural gas from that area of the reservoir. Dry hole or dry well – Exploratory or development well that does not produce oil or gas in commercial quantities. Exploratory well – A well drilled to find oil or natural gas in an unproved area or find a new reservoir in a field previously found to be productive by another reservoir. Field – An area consisting of a single reservoir or multiple reservoirs all grouped on or related to the same individual geological structural feature and/or stratigraphic condition. Fractionation – Fractionation is the process by which the mixture of NGLs that results from natural gas processing is separated into the NGL components, such as ethane, propane, butane, isobutane, and natural gasoline, prior to their sale to various petrochemical and industrial end users. Fractionation is accomplished by controlling the temperature of the stream of mixed liquids in order to take advantage of the difference in boiling points of separate products. Gross acreage – acreage in which a working interest is held by the Corporation. Gross well – a well in which a working interest is held by the Corporation. Mcf – One thousand cubic feet of natural gas. Mmcfd – One thousand mcf of natural gas per day. Net acreage or Net wells – The sum of the fractional working interests owned by us in gross acres or gross wells. NGLs or Natural gas liquids – Naturally occurring substances found in natural gas, including ethane, butane, isobutane, propane and natural gasoline that can be collectively removed from produced natural gas, separated into these substances and sold. Natural gas liquids do not sell at prices equivalent to crude oil. See the average selling prices in the table on page 9. Non-operated – Projects in which the Corporation has a working interest but does not perform the role of Operator. OPEC – Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. Operator – The entity responsible for conducting exploration, development and/or production operations for an oil or gas project. Participating interest – Reflects the proportion of exploration and production costs each party will bear or the proportion of production each party will receive, as set out in an operating agreement. Production entitlement – The share of gross production the Corporation is entitled to receive under the terms of a production sharing contract.   2  Production sharing contract – An agreement between a host government and the owners (or co-owners) of a well or field regarding the percentage of production each party will receive after the parties have recovered a specified amount of capital and operational expenses. Productive well – A well that is capable of producing hydrocarbons in sufficient quantities to justify commercial exploitation. Proved properties – Properties with proved reserves. Proved reserves – In accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission regulations and practices recognized in the publication of the Society of Petroleum Engineers entitled, “Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information,” those quantities of crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation. The project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the project within a reasonable time. Proved developed reserves – Proved reserves that can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or for which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well. Proved undeveloped reserves – Proved reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion. Reserves on undrilled acreage shall be limited to those directly offsetting development spacing areas that are reasonably certain of production when drilled, unless evidence using reliable technology exists that establishes reasonable certainty of economic producibility at greater distances. Unproved properties – Properties with no proved reserves. Working interest – An interest in an oil and gas property that provides the owner of the interest the right to drill for and produce oil and gas on the relevant acreage and requires the owner to pay a share of the costs of drilling and production operations.       3  PART I  Items 1 and 2. Business and Properties Hess Corporation, incorporated in the State of Delaware in 1920, is a global Exploration and Production (E&P) company engaged in exploration, development, production, transportation, purchase and sale of crude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas with production operations located primarily in the United States (U.S.), Denmark, Equatorial Guinea, the Malaysia/Thailand Joint Development Area (JDA), Malaysia, and Norway. The Bakken Midstream operating segment, which was established in the second quarter of 2015, provides fee-based services, including gathering, compressing and processing natural gas and fractionating natural gas liquids, or NGLs; gathering, terminaling, loading and transporting crude oil and NGLs; and storing and terminaling propane, primarily in the Bakken and Three Forks Shale plays in the Williston Basin area of North Dakota. See Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for further details. Exploration and Production Proved Reserves Proved reserves are calculated using the average price during the twelve-month period ending December 31 determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the price on the first day of each month within the year, unless prices are defined by contractual agreements, excluding escalations based on future conditions. Crude oil prices used in the determination of proved reserves at December 31, 2016 were $42.68 per barrel for WTI (2015: $50.13) and $44.45 per barrel for Brent (2015: $55.10).  Our total proved developed and undeveloped reserves at December 31 were as follows:           Crude Oil & Condensate        Natural Gas Liquids        Natural Gas        Total Barrels of Oil Equivalent (BOE)             2016        2015        2016        2015        2016        2015        2016        2015             (Millions of bbls)        (Millions of bbls)        (Millions of mcf)        (Millions of bbls)       Developed                                                                                                    United States        245           253           59           51           404           368           371           365       Europe (a)        116           114           3           12           125           123           140           147       Africa        138           148           —           —           132           137           160           171       Asia        5           5           —           —           739           643           128           112                504           520           62           63           1,400           1,271           799           795       Undeveloped                                                                                                    United States        110           93           27           23           186           137           168           139       Europe (a)        94           89           5           15           95           111           115           122       Africa        24           24           —           —           11           11           26           26       Asia        —           —           —           —           5           24           1           4                228           206           32           38           297           283           310           291       Total                                                                                                    United States        355           346           86           74           590           505           539           504       Europe (a)        210           203           8           27           220           234           255           269       Africa        162           172           —           —           143           148           186           197       Asia        5           5           —           —           744           667           129           116                732           726           94           101           1,697           1,554           1,109           1,086           (a)  Proved reserves in Norway, which represented 18% of our total proved reserves at December 31, 2016 (2015: 21%), were as follows:           Crude Oil & Condensate        Natural Gas Liquids        Natural Gas        Total Barrels of Oil Equivalent (BOE)             2016        2015        2016        2015        2016        2015        2016        2015             (Millions of bbls)        (Millions of bbls)        (Millions of mcf)        (Millions of bbls)       Developed        75           86           3           12           72           84           90           112       Undeveloped        90           85           5           15           88           107           110           118       Total        165           171           8           27           160           191           200           230      Proved undeveloped reserves were 28% of our total proved reserves at December 31, 2016 on a boe basis (2015: 27%).

E&P Operations A description of our significant E&P operations is as follows: United States  Our production in the U.S. was from onshore properties, principally in the Bakken oil shale play in the Williston Basin of North Dakota, the Utica Basin of Ohio and the Permian Basin of Texas and from offshore properties in the Gulf of Mexico. Onshore: Bakken:  At December 31, 2016, we held 577,000 net acres in the Bakken with varying working interest percentages. During 2016, we operated an average of 3.3 rigs, drilled 71 wells, completed 92 wells, and brought on production 100 wells, bringing the total operated production wells to 1,272. Drilling and completion costs per operated well averaged $4.8 million in 2016, down 17% from 2015. In 2016, we also increased our standard well design to a 50-stage completion from the previous 35-stage completion. The improved efficiency of our drilling operations can largely be attributed to application of our lean manufacturing capabilities. During 2017, we plan to increase our rig count to six rigs from two rigs, for an average of 3.5 rigs, to drill approximately 80 wells and to bring approximately 75 wells on production. Net production for full year 2017 is forecast to be in the range of 95,000 boepd to 105,000 boepd. With the building rig count we expect our Bakken production in the fourth quarter of 2017 to average between 105,000 boepd and 110,000 boepd, which would represent an increase of approximately 15% from the first quarter to the fourth quarter. Utica:  We own a 50% working interest in approximately 45,000 net acres in the wet gas area of the Utica Basin of Ohio. During 2016, a total of 6 wells were drilled, 6 wells were completed and 14 wells were brought on production. In March 2016, we and our joint venture partner released the remaining Hess operated rig. At December 31, 2016, we had 5 wells drilled but not completed on a single well pad. We do not plan to drill any wells in 2017. Permian: We operate and hold a 34% interest in the Seminole‑San Andres Unit in the Permian Basin. Offshore: At December 31, 2016, we held interests in 76 blocks in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Our production offshore in the Gulf of Mexico was principally from the Baldpate (Hess 50%), Conger (Hess 38%), Hack Wilson (Hess 25%), Llano (Hess 50%), Penn State (Hess 50%), Shenzi (Hess 28%) and Tubular Bells (Hess 57%) fields. In addition, we are operator of the Stampede development project (Hess 25%). At December 31, 2016, we held approximately 190,000 net undeveloped acres, of which leases covering approximately 85,000 acres are due to expire in the next three years.    6      A description of our significant operations in the Gulf of Mexico is as follows: Conger: At this Hess operated field, we drilled and brought online an additional production well during the year. In addition, one well was shut-in for an extended period in 2016 in order to replace a subsurface valve. Penn State: At this Hess operated field, we intend to drill one production well in 2017. Shenzi: At this BHP Billiton Petroleum operated field, drilling continued during 2016 with the completion of a water injection well. In 2017, the operator plans to defer further drilling activity. Tubular Bells: At this Hess operated field, we brought online a fifth production well and one water injector well, completing the initial drilling campaign. Three wells were shut-in for an extended period in 2016 due to subsurface valve failures. These valves have since been replaced and we are pursuing our options to recover damages for these valve failures. Stampede: At this Hess operated project in the Green Canyon area of the Gulf of Mexico, the co-owners sanctioned the field development and committed to two deepwater drilling rigs in 2014. In 2016, the topsides deck was installed on the hull, and fabrication and pre-commissioning of the topsides continues according to plan. We also completed installation of subsea equipment at both drill centers in the field, drilled one development well, and commenced drilling on one water injector well. First production from the field is targeted for 2018, and is expected to ramp up to a net rate of approximately 15,000 boepd. Europe Norway: In 2016, Aker BP assumed operatorship from BP of the offshore Valhall Field (Hess 64%). During 2016, well abandonment activities were conducted as part of a multi-year program that will continue into 2017. In 2017, the operator plans to drill two production wells from the existing platform rig, of which one well is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter. In 2017, net production is expected to average between 25,000 boepd to 30,000 boepd. Denmark: At the Hess operated offshore South Arne Field (Hess 62%), we completed drilling of a previously sanctioned eleven well multi-year program. In addition, the Danish government awarded a 20-year extension to the South Arne Field license, extending expiry to 2047. Africa Equatorial Guinea: At the Hess operated offshore Block G (Hess 85% paying interest, national oil company of Equatorial Guinea 5% carried interest), we have production from the Okume and Ceiba Fields. In 2016, there were no drilling operations and there are no plans for drilling in 2017. Ghana: At the Hess operated offshore Deepwater Tano/Cape Three Points license (Hess 50% license interest), we have drilled seven successful exploration wells on the block since 2011. In May 2013, we submitted appraisal plans for each of the seven discoveries, which comprise both oil and natural gas, to the Ghanaian government for approval. Five appraisal plans have been approved. In 2014, we drilled three successful appraisal wells. Well results continue to be evaluated and development planning is progressing. The government of Côte d’Ivoire has challenged the maritime border between it and the country of Ghana, which includes a portion of our Deepwater Tano/Cape Three Points license. We are unable to proceed with development of this license until there is a resolution of this matter, which may also impact our ability to develop the license. The International Tribunal for Law of the Sea is expected to render a final ruling on the maritime border dispute in 2017. Under terms of our license and subject to resolution of the border dispute, we have declared commerciality for four discoveries, including the Pecan Field in March 2016, which would be the primary development hub for the block. We are continuing to work with the government on how best to progress work on the block given the maritime border dispute. See Capitalized Exploratory Well Costs in Note 4, Property, Plant and Equipment in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for details of wells capitalized at December 31, 2016. Libya: At the onshore Waha concession in Libya, which include the Defa, Faregh, Gialo, North Gialo and Belhedan Fields (Hess 8%), the operator has shut in production for extended periods over the last three years due to force majeure caused by civil unrest. The national oil company of Libya lifted force majeure in September 2016 and production recommenced in October 2016. Net production averaged 1,000 bopd in 2016, zero in 2015, and 4,000 bopd in 2014. We have after-tax net book value in our Libyan operations of approximately $135 million and total proved reserves of 159 million boe at December 31, 2016.    7      Asia and Other Malaysia/Thailand Joint Development Area (JDA): At the Carigali Hess operated offshore Block A-18 in the Gulf of Thailand (Hess 50%), the operator continued development drilling and completed installation and commissioning of a major booster compression project in 2016. No drilling is planned for 2017 as contracted volumes are expected to be met as a result of the booster compression project. Malaysia: Our production in Malaysia comes from our interest in Block PM301 (Hess 50%), which is adjacent to and is unitized with Block A‑18 of the JDA and our 50% interest in Blocks PM302, PM325 and PM326B located in the North Malay Basin (NMB), offshore Peninsular Malaysia, where we operate a multi‑phase natural gas development project. In 2016, we completed the installation of three remote wellhead platforms and the jacket of the central processing platform. We also achieved mechanical completion of the central processing platform topsides and transport to the field via a heavy lift vessel is planned for the first quarter of 2017. We expect net production from NMB to increase from 26 million cubic feet per day in 2016 to approximately 165 million cubic feet per day following the completion of full field development in the third quarter of 2017.  Australia: At the WA‑390‑P and WA-474-P blocks (Hess 100%) in the Carnarvon Basin, offshore Western Australia (also known as Equus) covering approximately 658,000 acres, we have drilled 13 natural gas discoveries and 6 appraisal wells. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we terminated a joint front-end engineering study with a third party natural gas liquefaction joint venture and notified the government of Australia of our intent to defer further development of the project. As a result, we recognized an after-tax charge of $693 million to expense capitalized exploratory well costs and other project related costs. Guyana: At the Esso Exploration and Production Guyana Limited operated offshore Stabroek Block (Hess 30% participating interest), the operator announced a significant oil discovery at the Liza-1 well in 2015. During 2016, the operator completed a 17,000 square kilometer 3D seismic acquisition on the Stabroek Block and drilled the Liza-2 and Liza-3 wells, both of which encountered hydrocarbons. Pre-development planning and appraisal activities are underway and we expect to be in a position to sanction the first phase of the Liza development in mid-2017 with first production expected in 2020. At the Skipjack prospect 25 miles northwest of the Liza discovery, the operator completed the drilling of an exploration well, which was unsuccessful and expensed. In November 2016, the operator commenced drilling of the Payara-1 exploration well, located approximately 10 miles northwest of the Liza discovery, and in January 2017 announced results confirming the well as a second oil discovery on the block. In 2017, the operator plans to drill a well at the Snoek exploration prospect, a Liza-4 appraisal well, and a Payara-2 appraisal well. In addition, the operator will evaluate additional exploration opportunities on the broader Stabroek block. Suriname: In 2016 we acquired a 33% non-operated participating interest in the Kosmos Energy Ltd. operated Block 42 contract area, offshore Suriname, which is located in the Guyana-Suriname basin. The operator completed a 6,500 square kilometer 3D seismic shoot in January 2017.  Canada: At the four BP operated exploration licenses offshore Nova Scotia (Hess 50% participating interest), the operator expects to drill its first exploration well in 2018. Sales Commitments We have certain long-term contracts with fixed minimum sales volume commitments for natural gas and natural gas liquids production. At the JDA in the Gulf of Thailand, we have annual minimum net sales commitments of approximately 70 billion cubic feet of natural gas per year through 2025 and approximately 40 billion cubic feet per year in 2026 and 2027. At the North Malay Basin development project offshore Malaysia, we have annual net sales commitments of approximately 50 billion cubic feet per year from completion of full field development which is expected in the third quarter of 2017 through 2024. The Corporation’s estimated total volume of production subject to sales commitments over the remaining term of the contracts is approximately 1.1 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. We also have natural gas liquids minimum delivery commitments, primarily in the Bakken through 2023, of approximately 10 million barrels per year, or approximately 70 million barrels over the remaining life of the contracts. We have not experienced any significant constraints in satisfying the committed quantities required by our sales commitments, and we anticipate being able to meet future requirements from available proved and probable reserves and projected third-party supply.    8      Selling Prices and Production Costs The following table presents our average selling prices and average production costs:           2016        2015        2014       Average selling prices (a)                                        Crude oil - per barrel (including hedging)                                        United States                                        Onshore     $  36.92        $  42.67        $  81.89       Offshore        37.47           46.21           95.05       Total United States        37.13           44.01           87.21       Europe (b)        43.33           55.10           104.21       Africa        41.88           53.89           97.31       Asia        42.98           52.74           89.71       Worldwide        39.20           47.85           92.59       Crude oil - per barrel (excluding hedging)                                        United States                                        Onshore     $  36.92        $  41.22        $  81.89       Offshore        37.47           46.21           92.22       Total United States        37.13           43.11           86.06       Europe (b)        43.33           52.37           99.20       Africa        41.88           51.57           93.70       Asia        42.98           52.74           89.71       Worldwide        39.20           46.37           90.20       Natural gas liquids - per barrel                                        United States                                        Onshore     $  9.18        $  9.18        $  28.92       Offshore        13.96           14.40           30.40       Total United States        9.71           10.02           29.32       Europe (b)        19.48           24.59           52.66       Worldwide        9.95           10.52           30.59       Natural gas - per mcf                                        United States                                        Onshore     $  1.48        $  1.64        $  3.18       Offshore        1.99           2.03           3.79       Total United States        1.61           1.77           3.47       Europe (b)        3.97           6.72           10.00       Asia        5.31           5.97           6.94       Worldwide        3.37           4.16           6.04       Average production (lifting) costs per barrel of oil equivalent produced (c)                                        United States                                        Onshore     $  18.75        $  18.68        $  20.90       Offshore        18.88           7.03           5.06       Total United States        18.79           14.80           14.60       Europe (b)        21.28           23.61           28.93       Africa        20.53           23.12           22.41       Asia and other        11.91           8.34           9.11       Worldwide        18.45           16.17           16.86          (a)  Includes inter‑company transfers valued at approximate market prices and, primarily onshore United States, is adjusted for certain processing and distribution fees.

A crude oil pipeline and truck receipt terminal located in Williams County, North Dakota that is capable of delivering up to 282,000 bopd of crude oil into an interconnecting pipeline for transportation to the Tioga Rail Terminal and to multiple third-party pipelines and storage facilities.        •  Tioga Rail Terminal. A 140,000 bopd crude oil and 30,000 boepd NGL rail loading terminal in Tioga, North Dakota that is connected to the Tioga Gas Plant, the Ramberg Terminal Facility and our crude oil gathering system. During the summer of 2016, Hess piloted five third-party NGL unit trains consisting of 60 NGL rail cars that originated at the Tioga Rail Terminal.         •  Crude Oil Rail Cars. A total of 550 crude oil rail cars, which we operate as unit trains consisting of approximately 100 to 110 crude oil rail cars. These crude oil rail cars have been constructed to DOT-117 standards, with the exception of electronically controlled pneumatic brakes which, if required, can be added at a later date, prior to the regulation deadline, for minimal cost. In addition, HIP also has 956 older specification crude oil rail cars that are capable of being upgraded to the most recent DOT-117 safety standards. In 2016, we recorded an impairment charge against these older specification rail cars. See Note 6, Impairment in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.        •  Johnson’s Corner Header System. We are currently constructing the Johnson’s Corner Header System, a crude oil pipeline header system located in McKenzie County, North Dakota that will receive crude oil by pipeline from Hess and third parties and deliver crude oil to third-party interstate pipeline systems. At commissioning, the facility will have a delivery capacity of approximately 100,000 bopd of crude oil. We expect the Johnson’s Corner Header System to enter into service in 2017.  HIP owns 100% of Hess Midstream Partners LP, which was formed to own, operate, develop and acquire a diverse set of midstream assets to provide fee-based services to both Hess Corporation and third party customers as a publicly traded master limited partnership upon the future completion of an initial public offering of limited partnership units. Hess Midstream Partners LP filed an amendment to its registration statement on Form S-1 on February 13, 2017. The assets to be held by Hess Midstream Partners LP at the time of its initial public offering are expected to include a 20% economic interest in Hess North Dakota Pipelines Operations LP (owner of the natural gas gathering and compression and crude oil gathering systems), a 20% economic interest in Hess TGP Operations LP (owner of the Tioga gas plant), a 20% economic interest in    11      Hess North Dakota Export Logistics Operations LP (owner of the Tioga rail terminal, Ramberg terminal facility and 550 crude oil rail cars), and a 100% interest in Hess Mentor Storage Holdings LLC (owner of the Mentor storage terminal). Beginning January 1, 2017, Hess’s Midstream segment will include our interest in a Permian gas plant in West Texas and related CO2 assets, and water handling assets in North Dakota as a result of organizational changes to the management of the assets. These assets are wholly-owned by the Corporation and are not included in our HIP joint venture.  Divested Downstream Businesses In 2013, we announced several initiatives to continue our transformation from an integrated energy company into a more geographically focused pure play E&P company. The transformation plan included fully exiting the Corporation’s Marketing and Refining (M&R) business, including its terminal, retail, energy marketing and energy trading operations, as well as the permanent shutdown of refining operations at its Port Reading, NJ facility. See Note 9, Discontinued Operations in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  HOVENSA LLC (HOVENSA), a 50/50 joint venture between the Corporation’s subsidiary, Hess Oil Virgin Islands Corp. (HOVIC), and a subsidiary of Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA), had previously shut down its U.S. Virgin Islands refinery in 2012 and filed a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the United States District Court of the Virgin Islands in September 2015. In January 2016, a sale of HOVENSA’s terminal and refinery assets to Limetree Bay Terminals, LLC was completed and the Bankruptcy Court entered an order confirming HOVENSA’s Chapter 11 plan of liquidation (the “Liquidation Plan”). Under the Liquidation Plan, HOVENSA established a liquidating trust to distribute certain assets and sale proceeds to its creditors, established an environmental response trust to administer to HOVENSA’s remaining environmental obligations and to conduct an orderly wind-down of its remaining activities. See Note 10, HOVENSA LLC in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Competition and Market Conditions See Item 1A. Risk Factors for a discussion of competition and market conditions.   12      Other Items Emergency Preparedness and Response Plans and Procedures We have in place a series of business and asset-specific emergency preparedness, response and business continuity plans that detail procedures for rapid and effective emergency response and environmental mitigation activities. These plans are risk appropriate and are maintained, reviewed and updated as necessary to confirm their accuracy and suitability. Where appropriate, they are also reviewed and approved by the relevant host government authorities. Responder training and drills are routinely held worldwide to assess and continually improve the effectiveness of our plans. Our contractors, service providers, representatives from government agencies and, where applicable, joint venture partners participate in the drills to help ensure that emergency procedures are comprehensive and can be effectively implemented. To complement internal capabilities and to help ensure coverage for our global operations, we maintain membership contracts with a network of local, regional and global oil spill response and emergency response organizations. At the regional and global level, these organizations include Clean Gulf Associates (CGA), Marine Spill Response Corporation (MSRC), Marine Well Containment Company (MWCC), Wild Well Control (WWC), Subsea Well Intervention Service (SWIS) and Oil Spill Response Limited (OSRL). CGA and MSRC are domestic spill response organizations and MWCC provides the equipment and personnel to contain underwater well control incidents in the Gulf of Mexico. WWC provides firefighting, well control and engineering services globally. OSRL is a global response organization and is available, when needed, to assist us anywhere in the world. In addition to owning response assets in their own right, the organization maintains business relationships that provide immediate access to additional critical response support services if required. These owned response assets include nearly 300 recovery and storage vessels and barges, more than 250 skimmers, over 600,000 feet of boom, 9 capping stacks and significant quantities of dispersants and other ancillary equipment, including aircraft. In addition to external well control and oil spill response support, we have contracts with wildlife, environmental, meteorology, incident management, medical and security resources. If we were to engage these organizations to obtain additional critical response support services, we would fund such services and seek reimbursement under our insurance coverage, as described below. In certain circumstances, we pursue and enter into mutual aid agreements with other companies and government cooperatives to receive and provide oil spill response equipment and personnel support. We maintain close associations with emergency response organizations through our representation on the Executive Committees of CGA and MSRC, as well as the Board of Directors of OSRL. We continue to participate in a number of industry‑wide task forces that are studying better ways to assess the risk of and prevent onshore and offshore incidents, access and control blowouts in subsea environments, and improve containment and recovery methods. The task forces are working closely with the oil and gas industry and international government agencies to implement improvements and increase the effectiveness of oil spill prevention, preparedness, response and recovery processes. Insurance Coverage and Indemnification We maintain insurance coverage that includes coverage for physical damage to our property, third-party liability, workers’ compensation and employers’ liability, general liability, sudden and accidental pollution and other coverage. This insurance coverage is subject to deductibles, exclusions and limitations and there is no assurance that such coverage will adequately protect us against liability from all potential consequences and damages. The amount of insurance covering physical damage to our property and liability related to negative environmental effects resulting from a sudden and accidental pollution event, excluding Atlantic Named Windstorm coverage for which we are self‑insured, varies by asset, based on the asset's estimated replacement value or the estimated maximum loss. In the case of a catastrophic event, first party coverage consists of two tiers of insurance. The first $400 million of coverage is provided through an industry mutual insurance group. Above this $400 million threshold, insurance is carried which ranges in value up to $3.19 billion in total, depending on the asset coverage level, as described above. Additionally, we carry insurance that provides third-party coverage for general liability, and sudden and accidental pollution, up to $1.08 billion, which coverage under a standard joint operating arrangement would be reduced to our participating interest. Our insurance policies renew at various dates each year. Future insurance coverage could increase in cost and may include higher deductibles or retentions, or additional exclusions or limitations. In addition, some forms of insurance may become unavailable in the future or unavailable on terms that are deemed economically acceptable. Generally, our drilling contracts (and most of our other offshore services contracts) provide for a mutual hold harmless indemnity structure whereby each party to the contract (the Corporation and Contractor) indemnifies the other party for injuries or damages to their personnel and property (and, often, those of its contractors/subcontractors) regardless of fault.    13      Variations may include indemnity exclusions to the extent a claim is attributable to the gross negligence and/or willful misconduct of a party. Third‑party claims, on the other hand, are generally allocated on a fault basis. We are customarily responsible for, and indemnify the Contractor against, all claims including those from third‑parties, to the extent attributable to pollution or contamination by substances originating from our reservoirs or other property (regardless of cause, including gross negligence and willful misconduct) and the Contractor is responsible for and indemnifies us for all claims attributable to pollution emanating from the Contractor’s property. Additionally, we are generally liable for all of our own losses and most third‑party claims associated with catastrophic losses such as damage to reservoirs, blowouts, cratering and loss of hole, regardless of cause, although exceptions for losses attributable to gross negligence and/or willful misconduct do exist. Lastly, some offshore services contracts include overall limitations of the Contractor’s liability equal to the value of the contract or a fixed amount. Under a standard joint operating agreement (JOA), each party is liable for all claims arising under the JOA, to the extent of its participating interest (operator or non-operator). Variations include indemnity exclusions when the claim is based upon the gross negligence and/or willful misconduct of the operator, in which case the operator is solely liable. The parties to the JOA may continue to be jointly and severally liable for claims made by third-parties in some jurisdictions. Further, under some production sharing contracts between a governmental entity and commercial parties, liability of the commercial parties to the government entity is joint and several. Environmental Compliance with various existing environmental and pollution control regulations imposed by federal, state, local and foreign governments is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations but increasingly stringent environmental regulations have resulted and will likely continue to result in higher capital expenditures and operating expenses for us and the oil and gas industry in general. We spent approximately $10 million in 2016 for environmental remediation. The level of other expenditures to comply with federal, state, local and foreign country environmental regulations is difficult to quantify as such costs are captured as mostly indistinguishable components of our capital expenditures and operating expenses. For further discussion of environmental matters see Environment, Health and Safety in Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Number of Employees At December 31, 2016, we had 2,304 employees.

Risk Factors  Our business activities and the value of our securities are subject to significant risks, including the risk factors described below. These risk factors could negatively affect our operations, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations, and as a result, holders and purchasers of our securities could lose part or all of their investments. It is possible that additional risks relating to our securities may be described in a prospectus supplement if we issue securities in the future. Our business and operating results are highly dependent on the market prices of crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas, which can be very volatile. Our estimated proved reserves, revenue, operating cash flows, operating margins, liquidity, financial condition and future earnings are highly dependent on the benchmark market prices of crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas, and our associated realized price differentials, which are volatile and influenced by numerous factors beyond our control. The major foreign oil producing countries, including members of OPEC, may exert considerable influence over the supply and price of crude oil and refined petroleum products. Their ability or inability to agree on a common policy on rates of production and other matters may have a significant impact on the oil markets. Other factors include, but are not limited to: worldwide and domestic supplies of and demand for crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas, political conditions and events (including instability, changes in governments, or armed conflict) around the world and in particular in crude oil or natural gas producing regions, the cost of exploring for, developing and producing crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas, the price and availability of alternative fuels or other forms of energy, the effect of energy conservation and environmental protection efforts and overall economic conditions globally. The sentiment of commodities trading markets as well as other supply and demand factors may also influence the selling prices of crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas. Average prices for 2016 were $43.47 per barrel for WTI (2015: $48.76; 2014: $92.91) and $45.13 per barrel for Brent (2015: $53.60; 2014: $99.45). In order to manage the potential volatility of cash flows and credit requirements, we maintain significant bank credit facilities. An inability to access, renew or replace such credit facilities or access other sources of funding as they mature would negatively impact our liquidity. If we fail to successfully increase our reserves, our future crude oil and natural gas production will be adversely impacted. We own or have access to a finite amount of oil and gas reserves which will be depleted over time. Replacement of oil and gas production and reserves, including proved undeveloped reserves, is subject to successful exploration drilling, development activities, and enhanced recovery programs. Therefore, future oil and gas production is dependent on technical success in finding and developing additional hydrocarbon reserves. Exploration activity involves the interpretation of seismic and other geological and geophysical data, which does not always successfully predict the presence of commercial quantities of hydrocarbons. Drilling risks include unexpected adverse conditions, irregularities in pressure or formations, equipment failure, blowouts and weather interruptions. Future developments may be affected by unforeseen reservoir conditions which negatively affect recovery factors or flow rates. Reserve replacement can also be achieved through acquisition. Similar risks, however, may be encountered in the production of oil and gas on properties acquired from others. In addition to the technical risks to reserve replacement, replacing reserves and developing future production is also influenced by the price of crude oil and natural gas and costs of drilling and development activities. Persistent lower crude oil and natural gas prices, such as those currently prevailing, may have the effect of reducing capital available for exploration and development activity and may render certain development projects uneconomic or delay their completion and may result in negative revisions to existing reserves while increasing drilling and development costs could negatively affect expected economic returns. There are inherent uncertainties in estimating quantities of proved reserves and discounted future net cash flows, and actual quantities may be lower than estimated. Numerous uncertainties exist in estimating quantities of proved reserves and future net revenues from those reserves. Actual future production, oil and gas prices, revenues, taxes, capital expenditures, operating expenses, and quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves may vary substantially from those assumed in the estimates and could materially affect the estimated quantities of our proved reserves and the related future net revenues. In addition, reserve estimates may be subject to downward or upward changes based on production performance, purchases or sales of properties, results of future development, prevailing oil and gas prices, production sharing contracts, which may decrease reserves as crude oil and natural gas prices increase, and other factors. Crude oil prices declined significantly in 2015 and to a lesser extent in 2016 resulting in reductions to our reported proved reserves. If crude oil prices in 2017 average below prices used to determine proved reserves at December 31, 2016, it could have an adverse effect on our estimated proved reserves and the value of our business. See Crude Oil and Natural Gas Reserves in Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates in Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. We do not always control decisions made under joint operating agreements and the parties under such agreements may fail to meet their obligations. We conduct many of our E&P operations through joint operating agreements with other parties under which we may not control decisions, either because we do not have a controlling interest or are not operator under the agreement. There is risk that these parties may at any time have economic, business, or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours, and therefore decisions may be made which are not what we believe is in our best interest.    15      Moreover, parties to these agreements may be unable to meet their economic or other obligations and we may be required to fulfill those obligations alone. In either case, the value of our investment may be adversely affected. We are subject to changing laws and regulations and other governmental actions that can significantly and adversely affect our business. Federal, state, local, territorial and foreign laws and regulations relating to tax increases and retroactive tax claims, disallowance of tax credits and deductions, expropriation or nationalization of property, mandatory government participation, cancellation or amendment of contract rights, imposition of capital controls or blocking of funds, changes in import and export regulations, limitations on access to exploration and development opportunities, anti-bribery or anti-corruption laws, as well as other political developments may affect our operations. We have substantial capital requirements, and we may not be able to obtain needed financing on satisfactory terms, if at all. The exploration, development and production of crude oil and natural gas involves substantial costs, which may not be fully funded from operations. For example, in 2016, we had a significant net loss and, if commodity prices remain low through 2017, we are forecasting a net loss for 2017. Two of the three major credit rating agencies that rate our debt have assigned an investment grade rating. In February 2016, Standard and Poor’s Ratings Services (S&P) lowered our investment grade credit rating one notch to BBB- with stable outlook and Moody’s Investors Service (Moody’s) lowered our credit rating to Ba1 with stable outlook, which is below investment grade. In December 2016, Fitch Ratings (Fitch) lowered our investment grade credit rating one notch to BBB- with stable outlook. In February 2017, S&P re-affirmed our investment grade credit rating of BBB- with stable outlook. Although, currently we do not have any borrowings under our long-term credit facility, further ratings downgrades, continued weakness in the oil and gas industry or negative outcomes within commodity and financial markets could adversely impact our access to capital markets by increasing the costs of financing, or by impacting our ability to obtain financing on satisfactory terms, or at all. In addition, further ratings downgrades may require that we issue letters of credit or provide other forms of collateral under certain contractual requirements. Any inability to access capital markets could adversely impact our financial adaptability and our ability to execute our strategy and may also expose us to heightened exposure to credit risk. Political instability in areas where we operate can adversely affect our business. Some of the international areas in which we operate, and the partners with whom we operate, are politically less stable than other areas and partners and may be subject to civil unrest, conflict, insurgency, geographic territorial border disputes, corruption, security risks and labor unrest. Political and civil unrest in North Africa and the Middle East has affected and may affect our operations in these areas as well as oil and gas markets generally. The threat of terrorism around the world also poses additional risks to the operations of the oil and gas industry. Our oil and gas operations are subject to environmental risks and environmental laws and regulations that can result in significant costs and liabilities. Our oil and gas operations, like those of the industry, are subject to environmental risks such as oil spills, produced water spills, gas leaks and ruptures and discharges of substances or gases that could expose us to substantial liability for pollution or other environmental damage. Our operations are also subject to numerous U.S. federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations. Non‑compliance with these laws and regulations may subject us to administrative, civil or criminal penalties, remedial clean-ups and natural resource damages or other liabilities. In addition, increasingly stringent environmental regulations have resulted and will likely continue to result in higher capital expenditures and operating expenses for us and the oil and gas industry in general. Similarly, we have material legal obligations to dismantle, remove and abandon production facilities and wells that will occur many years in the future, in most cases. These estimates may be impacted by future changes in regulations and other uncertainties. Concerns have been raised in certain jurisdictions where we have operations concerning the safety and environmental impact of the drilling and development of shale oil and gas resources, particularly hydraulic fracturing, water usage, flaring of associated natural gas and air emissions. While we believe that these operations can be conducted safely and with minimal impact on the environment, regulatory bodies are responding to these concerns and may impose moratoriums and new regulations on such drilling operations that would likely have the effect of prohibiting or delaying such operations and increasing their cost. Climate change initiatives may result in significant operational changes and expenditures, reduced demand for our products and adversely affect our business. We recognize that climate change is a global environmental concern. Continuing political and social attention to the issue of climate change has resulted in both existing and pending international agreements and national, regional or local legislation and regulatory measures to limit greenhouse gas emissions. These agreements and measures may require significant equipment modifications, operational changes, taxes, or purchase of emission credits to reduce emission of greenhouse gases from our operations, which may result in substantial capital expenditures and compliance, operating, maintenance and remediation costs. In addition, our production is used to produce petroleum fuels, which through normal customer use may result in the emission of greenhouse gases. Regulatory initiatives to reduce the use of these fuels may reduce demand for crude oil and other hydrocarbons and have an adverse effect on our    16      sales volumes, revenues and margins. The imposition and enforcement of stringent greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets could severely and adversely impact the oil and gas industry and significantly reduce the value of our business. Our industry is highly competitive and many of our competitors are larger and have greater resources than we have. The petroleum industry is highly competitive and very capital intensive. We encounter competition from numerous companies in each of our activities, including acquiring rights to explore for crude oil and natural gas. Many competitors, including national oil companies, are larger and have substantially greater resources. We are also in competition with producers of other forms of energy. Increased competition for worldwide oil and gas assets could significantly increase the cost of acquiring oil and gas assets. In addition, competition for drilling services, technical expertise and equipment may affect the availability of technical personnel and drilling rigs, resulting in increased capital and operating costs. Catastrophic events, whether naturally occurring or man‑made, may materially affect our operations and financial conditions. Our oil and gas operations are subject to unforeseen occurrences which have affected us from time to time and which may damage or destroy assets, interrupt operations and have other significant adverse effects. Examples of catastrophic risks include hurricanes, fires, explosions, blowouts, such as the third-party accident at the Macondo prospect, pipeline interruptions and ruptures, severe weather, geological events, labor disputes or cyber‑attacks. Although we maintain insurance coverage against property and casualty losses, there can be no assurance that such insurance will adequately protect us against liability from all potential consequences and damages. Moreover, some forms of insurance may be unavailable in the future or be available only on terms that are deemed economically unacceptable. Significant time delays between the estimated and actual occurrence of critical events associated with development projects may result in material negative economic consequences. We are involved in several large development projects and the completion of those projects may be delayed beyond what was originally anticipated. Such examples include, but are not limited to, delays in receiving necessary approvals from project members or regulatory agencies, timely access to necessary equipment, availability of necessary personnel, construction delays, unfavorable weather conditions and equipment failures. This may lead to delays and differences between estimated and actual timing of critical events. These delays could impact our future results of operations and cash flows. Departures of key members from our senior management team, and/or difficulty in recruiting and retaining adequate numbers of experienced technical personnel, could negatively impact our ability to deliver on our strategic goals. The derivation and monitoring of successful strategies and related policies may be negatively impacted by the departure of key members of senior management. Moreover, an inability to recruit and retain adequate numbers of experienced technical and professional personnel in the necessary locations may prohibit us from executing our strategy in full or, in part, with a commensurate impact on shareholder value. We are dependent on oilfield service companies for items including drilling rigs, equipment, supplies and skilled labor. An inability or significant delay in securing these services, or a high cost thereof, may result in material negative economic consequences. The availability and cost of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies and skilled labor will fluctuate over time given the cyclical nature of the E&P industry. As a result, we may encounter difficulties in obtaining required services or could face an increase in cost. These consequences may impact our ability to run our operations and to deliver projects on time with the potential for material negative economic consequences. We manage commodity price and other risks through our risk management function but such activities may impede our ability to benefit from commodity price increases and can expose us to similar potential counterparty credit risk as impacts amounts due from the sale of hydrocarbons. We may enter into commodity price hedging arrangements to protect us from commodity price declines. These arrangements may, depending on the instruments used and the level of increases involved, limit any potential upside from commodity price increases. As with accounts receivable we may be exposed to potential economic loss should a counterparty be unable or unwilling to perform their obligations under the terms of a hedging agreement. In addition, we are exposed to risks related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency values, and may engage in hedging activities to mitigate related volatility. Cyber‑attacks targeting computer, telecommunications systems, and infrastructure used by the oil and gas industry may materially impact our business and operations. Computers and telecommunication systems are used to conduct our exploration, development and production activities and have become an integral part of our business. We use these systems to analyze and store financial and operating data and to communicate within our company and with outside business partners. Cyber‑attacks could compromise our computer and telecommunications systems and result in disruptions to our business operations or the loss of our data and proprietary information. In addition, computers control oil and gas production, processing equipment, and distribution systems globally and are necessary to deliver our production to market. A cyber‑attack against these operating systems, or the networks and infrastructure on which they rely, could damage critical production, distribution and/or storage assets, delay or prevent delivery to markets, and make it difficult or impossible to accurately account for production and settle transactions. As a result, a cyber-attack could have a material adverse impact on    17      our cash flows and results of operations. We routinely experience attempts by external parties to penetrate and attack our networks and systems. Although such attempts to date have not resulted in any material breaches, disruptions, or loss of business critical information, our systems and procedures for protecting against such attacks and mitigating such risks may prove to be insufficient in the future and such attacks could have an adverse impact on our business and operations. In addition, as technologies evolve and these attacks become more sophisticated, we may incur significant costs to upgrade or enhance our security measures to protect against such attacks. Item 1B.
