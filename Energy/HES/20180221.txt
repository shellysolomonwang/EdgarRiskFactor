Item 1A. Risk Factors within this document.        Glossary Throughout this report, the following company or industry specific terms and abbreviations are used: Appraisal well – An exploration well drilled to confirm the results of a discovery well, or a well used to determine the boundaries of a productive formation. Bbl – One stock tank barrel, which is 42 United States gallons liquid volume. Barrel of oil equivalent or Boe – This reflects natural gas reserves converted on the basis of relative energy content of six mcf equals one barrel of oil equivalent (one mcf represents one thousand cubic feet). Barrel of oil equivalence does not necessarily result in price equivalence, as the equivalent price of natural gas on a barrel of oil equivalent basis has been substantially lower than the corresponding price for crude oil over the recent past. See the average selling prices in the table on page 9. Boepd – Barrels of oil equivalent per day. Bopd – Barrels of oil per day. Condensate – A mixture of hydrocarbons that exists in the gaseous phase at original reservoir temperature and pressure, but that when produced, is in the liquid phase at surface pressure and temperature. Development well – A well drilled within the proved area of an oil and/or natural gas reservoir with the intent of producing oil and/or natural gas from that area of the reservoir. Dry hole or dry well – An exploratory or development well that does not find oil or natural gas in commercial quantities. Exploratory well – A well drilled to find oil or natural gas in an unproved area or find a new reservoir in a field previously found to be productive by another reservoir. Fractionation – Fractionation is the process by which the mixture of NGLs that results from natural gas processing is separated into the NGL components, such as ethane, propane, butane, isobutane, and natural gasoline, prior to their sale to various petrochemical and industrial end users. Fractionation is accomplished by controlling the temperature of the stream of mixed liquids in order to take advantage of the difference in boiling points of separate products. Field – An area consisting of a single reservoir or multiple reservoirs all grouped or related to the same individual geological structural feature and/or stratigraphic condition. Gross acreage – acreage in which a working interest is held by the Corporation. Gross well – a well in which a working interest is held by the Corporation. Mcf – One thousand cubic feet of natural gas. Mmcfd – One thousand mcf of natural gas per day. Net acreage or Net wells – The sum of the fractional working interests owned by us in gross acres or gross wells. NGLs or Natural gas liquids – Naturally occurring substances that are separated and produced by fractionating natural gas, including ethane, butane, isobutane, propane and natural gasoline. Natural gas liquids do not sell at prices equivalent to crude oil. See the average selling prices in the table on page 9. Non-operated – Projects in which the Corporation has a working interest but does not perform the role of Operator. OPEC – Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. Operator – The entity responsible for conducting and managing exploration, development, and/or production operations for an oil or gas project. Participating interest – Reflects the proportion of exploration and production costs each party will bear or the proportion of production each party will receive, as set out in an operating agreement. Production entitlement – The share of gross production the Corporation is entitled to receive under the terms of a production sharing contract. Production sharing contract – An agreement between a host government and the owners (or co-owners) of a well or field regarding the percentage of production each party will receive after the parties have recovered a specified amount of capital and operational expenses.   2    Productive well – A well that is capable of producing hydrocarbons in sufficient quantities to justify commercial exploitation. Proved properties – Properties with proved reserves. Proved reserves – In accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission regulations and practices recognized in the publication of the Society of Petroleum Engineers entitled, “Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information,” those quantities of crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation. The project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the project within a reasonable time. Proved developed reserves – Proved reserves that can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or for which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well. Proved undeveloped reserves – Proved reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion. Reserves on undrilled acreage shall be limited to those directly offsetting development spacing areas that are reasonably certain of production when drilled, unless evidence using reliable technology exists that establishes reasonable certainty of economic producibility at greater distances. Unproved properties – Properties with no proved reserves. Working interest – An interest in an oil and gas property that provides the owner of the interest the right to drill for and produce oil and gas on the relevant acreage and requires the owner to pay a share of the costs of drilling and production operations.       3    PART I  Items 1 and 2. Business and Properties Hess Corporation, incorporated in the State of Delaware in 1920, is a global Exploration and Production (E&P) company engaged in exploration, development, production, transportation, purchase and sale of crude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas with production operations located primarily in the United States (U.S.), Denmark, the Malaysia/Thailand Joint Development Area (JDA) and Malaysia. The Corporation conducts exploration activities primarily offshore Guyana, Suriname, Canada and in the Gulf of Mexico, including at the Stabroek Block, offshore Guyana, where we have participated in six significant crude oil discoveries and sanctioned the first phase of a multi-phase development project at the Liza Field. During 2017, we sold our interests in Equatorial Guinea, Norway and our enhanced oil recovery assets in the Permian Basin, onshore U.S. The 2017 asset sales of higher cost, mature assets will provide funds toward our future development projects in the Stabroek Block, offshore Guyana. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we announced that we would commence a process to sell our interests in Denmark in 2018. The Corporation’s Midstream operating segment provides fee-based services, including gathering, compressing and processing natural gas and fractionating natural gas liquids (NGLs); gathering, terminaling, loading and transporting crude oil and NGLs; and storing and terminaling propane, primarily in the Bakken and Three Forks Shale plays in the Williston Basin area of North Dakota. On January 1, 2017, the Corporation’s interests in a Permian Basin gas plant in West Texas and related CO2 assets, and water handling assets in North Dakota were transferred from the E&P segment to the Midstream segment as a result of organizational changes to the management of those assets. In the third quarter of 2017, we completed the sale of our Midstream assets in the Permian Basin. See Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for further details. Exploration and Production Proved Reserves Proved reserves are calculated using the average price during the twelve-month period ending December 31 determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the price on the first day of each month within the year, unless prices are defined by contractual agreements, and exclude escalations based on future conditions. Crude oil prices used in the determination of proved reserves at December 31, 2017 were $51.19 per barrel for WTI (2016: $42.68) and $54.87 per barrel for Brent (2016: $44.45). Our total proved developed and undeveloped reserves at December 31 were as follows:           Crude Oil & Condensate        Natural Gas Liquids        Natural Gas        Total Barrels of Oil Equivalent (BOE)             2017        2016        2017        2016        2017        2016        2017        2016             (Millions of bbls)        (Millions of bbls)        (Millions of mcf)        (Millions of bbls)       Developed                                                                                                    United States        239           245           87           59           526           404           414           371       Europe (a)        45           116           —           3           80           125           58           140       Africa        112           138           —           —           117           132           132           160       Asia and other        5           5           —           —           696           739           121           128                401           504           87           62           1,419           1,400           725           799       Undeveloped                                                                                                    United States        194           110           84           27           354           186           337           168       Europe (a)        4           94           —           5           12           95           6           115       Africa        16           24           —           —           7           11           17           26       Asia and other (b)        44           —           —           —           149           5           69           1                258           228           84           32           522           297           429           310       Total                                                                                                    United States        433           355           171           86           880           590           751           539       Europe (a)        49           210           —           8           92           220           64           255       Africa        128           162           —           —           124           143           149           186       Asia and other (b)        49           5           —           —           845           744           190           129                659           732           171           94           1,941           1,697           1,154           1,109           (a)  At December 31, 2016, proved reserves in Norway, which were sold in 2017, included crude oil and condensate of 165 million barrels (developed - 75 million barrels; undeveloped - 90 million barrels), natural gas liquids of 8 million barrels (developed - 3 million barrels; undeveloped - 5 million barrels), and natural gas of 160 million mcf (developed - 72 million mcf; undeveloped – 88 million mcf).      (b)  Asia and other includes proved undeveloped reserves in Guyana of 45 million boe at December 31, 2017 (2016: 0 million boe).   4    Proved undeveloped reserves were 37% of our total proved reserves at December 31, 2017 on a boe basis (2016: 28%). Proved reserves held under production sharing contracts totaled 7% of our crude oil reserves and 44% of our natural gas reserves at December 31, 2017 (2016: 4% and 45%, respectively).

Permian production averaged 4,000 boepd in 2017 (2016: 7,000 boepd; 2015: 9,000 boepd). See Note 2, Dispositions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.     (b)  Includes 4,256 thousand mcf of production for 2017 (2016: 3,624 thousand mcf; 2015: 5,321 thousand mcf) from Block PM301 which is unitized into Block A-18 of the JDA. E&P Operations At December 31, 2017, our significant E&P assets include the following: United States  Our production in the U.S. was from onshore properties, principally in the Bakken oil shale play in the Williston Basin of North Dakota (Bakken) and the Utica Basin of Ohio and from offshore properties in the Gulf of Mexico. Onshore: Bakken:  At December 31, 2017, we held approximately 554,000 net acres in the Bakken with varying working interest percentages. During 2017, we operated an average of 3.5 rigs, drilled 85 wells, completed 68 wells, and brought 68 wells on production, bringing the total operated production wells to 1,315 by year-end. Drilling and completion costs per operated well averaged $5.6 million in 2017, based on a change in our standard well design during the year to a 60-stage completion with proppant loadings of 140,000 pounds per stage compared to an average well cost of $4.8 million in 2016 using a 50-stage completion with proppant loadings of 70,000 pounds per stage. During 2018, we plan to increase our rig count in the second half of the year to six rigs from four rigs, to drill approximately 120 wells and bring approximately 95 wells on production. In addition, our capital budget for 2018 will fund pad construction in preparation for 2019 drilling. We forecast net production for full year 2018 to be in the range of 115,000 boepd to 120,000 boepd, compared to production of 105,000 boepd in 2017. Utica:  We own a 50% working interest in approximately 37,000 net acres in the wet gas area of the Utica Basin of Ohio. There was no drilling activity in the Utica in 2017. In 2018, we expect to complete and bring on production five previously drilled wells. Offshore: At December 31, 2017, we held interests in 73 blocks in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Our production offshore in the Gulf of Mexico was principally from the Baldpate (Hess 50%), Conger (Hess 38%), Hack Wilson (Hess 25%), Llano (Hess 50%), Penn State (Hess 50%), Shenzi (Hess 28%) and Tubular Bells (Hess 57%) Fields. In addition, we are operator of the Stampede development project (Hess 25%). At December 31, 2017, we held approximately 210,000 net undeveloped acres, of which leases covering approximately 55,000 acres are due to expire in the next three years.    6      Significant events relating to operations in the Gulf of Mexico during 2017 were as follows: Producing assets: Production from the Baldpate, Conger, Llano and Penn State Fields were shut-in following a fire at the third-party operated Enchilada platform in November 2017. Prior to the shut-down, net production from these assets was approximately 30,000 boepd. Production at the Baldpate Field restarted in mid-February and is expected to restart at the Penn State Field in the first quarter, at the Llano Field in the second quarter, and at the Conger Field in the third quarter of 2018. Penn State: At this Hess operated Field, we drilled one production well that was completed in November 2017.  Stampede: At this Hess operated project in the Green Canyon area of the Gulf of Mexico, in 2017 we completed installation of the tension leg platform and subsea equipment, finished drilling and completing three production wells, and received regulatory approval for production operations at the end of the year. In January 2018, we commenced production from the field, which is expected to ramp up over the next 18 months as we continue a drilling program of three additional production wells and four water injection wells. Europe Denmark: In 2017, we announced that we plan to commence a process to sell our interest in the Hess operated offshore South Arne Field (Hess 62%) in 2018. Total proved reserves for Denmark were 64 million boe at December 31, 2017. Africa Ghana: At the Hess operated offshore Deepwater Tano/Cape Three Points license (Hess 50% license interest), management determined in the fourth quarter of 2017 that it would not develop the previously discovered fields. As a result, we recorded a charge of $280 million to write-off previously capitalized exploration wells and other lease costs.  See Capitalized Exploratory Well Costs in Note 5, Property, Plant and Equipment, and Note 24, Subsequent Events in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  Libya: At the onshore Waha concession in Libya, which includes the Defa, Faregh, Gialo, North Gialo and Belhedan Fields (Hess 8%), production was shut-in by the operator for extended periods in 2016 and 2015 due to force majeure caused by civil unrest. The national oil company of Libya lifted force majeure in September 2016 and production recommenced in October 2016. Net production averaged approximately 10,000 boepd in 2017, 1,000 boepd in 2016, and zero in 2015. Asia and Other Malaysia/Thailand Joint Development Area (JDA): At the Carigali Hess operated offshore Block A-18 in the Gulf of Thailand (Hess 50%), no drilling is planned for 2018 as contracted volumes are expected to be met as a result of the booster compression project that came online in 2016. Malaysia: Our production in Malaysia comes from our interest in Block PM301 (Hess 50%), which is adjacent to and is unitized with Block A‑18 of the JDA and our 50% interest in Blocks PM302, PM325 and PM326B located in the North Malay Basin (NMB), offshore Peninsular Malaysia, where we operate a multi‑phase natural gas development project. In July 2017, production of natural gas commenced from the full-field development and net production for 2017 averaged 66 mmcfd, with the planned plateau rate of 165 mmcfd being achieved in the fourth quarter. In 2018, we plan to drill three production wells and progress development activities related to future phases. Guyana: At the Esso Exploration and Production Guyana Limited operated offshore Stabroek Block (Hess 30% participating interest), the partners sanctioned the first phase of the Liza Field development in 2017. This phase is expected to have a gross capital cost of approximately $3.2 billion for drilling and subsea infrastructure, of which we expect to incur $250 million net in 2018, with first production expected in March 2020. The development plan includes a leased floating production, storage and offloading (FPSO) vessel that will have the capacity to process up to 120,000 barrels of oil per day from 17 wells, including eight producers, six water injectors and three gas injectors. At December 31, 2017, we have proved reserves of 45 million boe, related to Liza Phase 1.  An application for an environmental permit to develop the second phase at Liza has been submitted. The concept for Phase 2 involves the use of a larger FPSO vessel and subsea systems that would have a production capacity of approximately 220,000 bopd, with first production expected by mid-2022. Planning is also underway for a third phase of development with an FPSO vessel at the Payara Field with first production planned for 2023 or 2024. The size of the third ship will depend upon the results of future exploration and appraisal drilling.   7      In 2017, the following wells were completed on the Stabroek Block (in chronological order): Payara-1: The well, located approximately 10 miles northwest of the Liza discovery, encountered 95 feet of high-quality, oil bearing sandstone reservoirs.  Snoek-1: The well encountered more than 82 feet of high-quality, oil-bearing sandstone reservoirs and is located approximately 5 miles southeast of the Liza-1 oil discovery. Liza-4: The well encountered more than 197 feet of high-quality, oil-bearing sandstone reservoirs. Payara-2: The well encountered 59 feet of high-quality, oil-bearing sandstone reservoirs and confirmed a second large oil field in addition to the Liza Field. The well is located approximately 12 miles northwest from the Liza Phase 1 project.  Turbot-1: The well encountered a reservoir of 75 feet of high-quality, oil-bearing sandstone in the primary objective. The well is located approximately 30 miles to the southeast of the Liza Phase 1 project.  In January 2018, the operator announced a sixth oil discovery at the Ranger prospect. The Ranger-1 well encountered approximately 230 feet of high-quality, oil-bearing carbonate reservoir, and is located approximately 60 miles to the northwest of the Liza Field. In 2018, additional drilling is planned, including appraisal of the Liza, Turbot and Ranger discoveries, as well as a wider exploration program that will target additional prospects and play types on the block. Drilling of the Pacora prospect commenced in January.  Suriname: We hold a 33% non-operated participating interest in the Block 42 contract area, offshore Suriname. The operator, Kosmos Energy Ltd., completed a 6,500-square kilometer 3D seismic shoot in 2017 and expects to drill its first exploration well in 2018. In 2017, we entered into a 33% non-operated participating interest in the Block 59 contract area, offshore Suriname, where the operator, ExxonMobil Exploration and Production Suriname B.V., is planning a seismic program in 2018.  Canada: We hold a 50% participating interest in four exploration licenses offshore Nova Scotia. In 2018, the operator, BP Canada, plans to drill its first exploration well. In addition, in 2017 we were granted a 25% participating interest in three BP Canada operated exploration licenses offshore Newfoundland. Sales Commitments We have certain long-term contracts with fixed minimum sales volume commitments for natural gas and natural gas liquids production. At the JDA in the Gulf of Thailand, we have annual minimum net sales commitments of approximately 85 billion cubic feet of natural gas per year through 2025 and approximately 40 billion cubic feet per year in 2026 and 2027. At the North Malay Basin development project offshore Malaysia, we have annual net sales commitments of approximately 55 billion cubic feet per year through 2024. Our estimated total volume of production subject to these sales commitments is approximately 1.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. We also have natural gas liquids minimum delivery commitments, primarily in the Bakken through 2023, of approximately 10 million barrels per year, or approximately 60 million barrels over the remaining life of the contracts. We have not experienced any significant constraints in satisfying the committed quantities required by our sales commitments, and we anticipate being able to meet future requirements from available proved and probable reserves and projected third-party supply.    8      Selling Prices and Production Costs The following table presents our average selling prices and average production costs:           2017        2016        2015       Average selling prices (a)                                        Crude oil - per barrel (including hedging)                                        United States                                        Onshore     $  46.04        $  36.92        $  42.67       Offshore        47.34           37.47           46.21       Total United States        46.50           37.13           44.01       Europe (b)        55.03           43.33           55.10       Africa        53.17           41.88           53.89       Asia        56.99           42.98           52.74       Worldwide        49.23           39.20           47.85       Crude oil - per barrel (excluding hedging)                                        United States                                        Onshore     $  46.76        $  36.92        $  41.22       Offshore        48.15           37.47           46.21       Total United States        47.25           37.13           43.11       Europe (b)        55.14           43.33           52.37       Africa        53.25           41.88           51.57       Asia        56.99           42.98           52.74       Worldwide        49.75           39.20           46.37       Natural gas liquids - per barrel                                        United States                                        Onshore     $  17.67        $  9.18        $  9.18       Offshore        21.34           13.96           14.40       Total United States        18.10           9.71           10.02       Europe (b)        29.04           19.48           24.59       Worldwide        18.35           9.95           10.52       Natural gas - per mcf                                        United States                                        Onshore     $  1.96        $  1.48        $  1.64       Offshore        2.22           1.99           2.03       Total United States        2.03           1.61           1.77       Europe (b)        4.42           3.97           6.72       Asia        4.27           5.31           5.97       Worldwide        3.37           3.37           4.16       Average production (lifting) costs per barrel of oil equivalent produced (c)                                        United States                                        Onshore (d)     $  19.66        $  18.46        $  18.57       Offshore        11.89           18.88           7.03       Total United States        17.44           18.58           14.73       Europe (b)        21.95           21.28           23.61       Africa        14.40           20.53           23.12       Asia and other        7.83           11.91           8.34       Worldwide        16.08           18.32           16.12          (a)  Includes inter‑company transfers valued at approximate market prices and, primarily onshore U.S., is adjusted for certain processing and distribution fees.     (b)  In 2017, we sold our assets in Norway. See Note 2, Dispositions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The average selling prices in Norway for 2016 were $43.32 per barrel for crude oil (including hedging), $43.32 per barrel for crude oil (excluding hedging), $19.48 per barrel for natural gas liquids and $5.22 per mcf for natural gas (2015: $54.89, $52.15, $24.59 and $8.58, respectively). The average production (lifting) costs in Norway were $24.70 per barrel of oil equivalent in 2016 (2015: $25.81).

See Note 5, Property, Plant and Equipment in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.     (b)  In 2016, we expensed 18 wells relating to our Equus natural gas project, offshore Australia, which were drilled in prior years. Number of Wells in the Process of Being Drilled At December 31, 2017, the number of wells in the process of drilling amounted to:           Gross        Net             Wells        Wells       United States        70           27       Asia and other        2           1       Total        72           28        10      Midstream The Midstream operating segment provides fee-based services, including gathering, compressing and processing natural gas and fractionating natural gas liquids (NGLs); gathering, terminaling, loading and transporting crude oil and NGLs; and storing and terminaling propane, primarily in the Bakken and Three Forks Shale plays in the Williston Basin area of North Dakota. In July 2015, we sold a 50% interest in Hess Infrastructure Partners LP (HIP) to Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP) for net cash consideration of approximately $2.6 billion. In April 2017, Hess Midstream Partners LP (the “Partnership”), sold 16,997,000 common units representing limited partner interests at a price of $23 per unit in an initial public offering (IPO) for net proceeds of $365.5 million, of which $350 million was distributed equally to Hess Corporation and GIP.  At December 31, 2017, Hess Corporation and GIP each owned a direct 33.75% limited partner interest in the Partnership and a 50% indirect ownership interest through HIP in the Partnership’s general partner, which has a 2% economic interest in the Partnership plus incentive distribution rights. The public unit holders own a 30.5% limited partner interest in the Partnership. In turn, the Partnership owns an approximate 20% controlling interest in the operating companies that comprise our midstream joint venture, while HIP, the 50/50 joint venture between Hess Corporation and GIP, owns the remaining 80%.  The Partnership, and HIP and its affiliates primarily comprise the Midstream operating segment, which currently generates substantially all of its revenues under long-term, fee-based agreements with our E&P operating segment but intends to pursue additional throughput volumes from third-parties in the Williston Basin area. We operate the Midstream assets under various operational and administrative services agreements. Beginning January 1, 2017, the Midstream segment included our interest in a Permian gas plant in West Texas and related CO2 assets, and water handling assets in North Dakota as a result of organizational changes to the management of those assets. In the third quarter of 2017, we completed the sale of our assets in the Permian Basin, including the gas plant in West Texas and related CO2 assets. The water assets are wholly-owned by the Corporation and are not included in our HIP joint venture. At December 31, 2017, Midstream assets include the following:        •  Natural Gas Gathering and Compression: A natural gas gathering and compression system located primarily in McKenzie, Williams and Mountrail Counties, North Dakota connecting Hess and third-party owned or operated wells to the Tioga Gas Plant and third-party pipeline facilities. This gathering system consists of approximately 1,200 miles of high and low pressure natural gas and NGL gathering pipelines with a current capacity of up to 345 mmcfd, including an aggregate compression capacity of 174 mmcfd. The system also includes the Hawkeye Gas Facility, which contributes 50 mmcfd of the system’s current compression capacity.         •  Crude Oil Gathering: A crude oil gathering system located primarily in McKenzie, Williams and Mountrail Counties, North Dakota, connecting Hess and third-party owned or operated wells to the Ramberg Terminal Facility, the Tioga Rail Terminal and the Johnson’s Corner Header System. The crude oil gathering system consists of approximately 365 miles of crude oil gathering pipelines with a current capacity of up to 161,000 bopd. The system also includes the Hawkeye Oil Facility, which contributes 76,000 bopd of the system’s current capacity.         •  Tioga Gas Plant: A natural gas processing and fractionation plant located in Tioga, North Dakota, with a current processing capacity of 250 mmcfd and fractionation capacity of 60,000 boepd.        •  Mentor Storage Terminal: A propane storage cavern and rail and truck loading and unloading facility located in Mentor, Minnesota, with approximately 328,000 boe of working storage capacity.        •  Ramberg Terminal Facility: A crude oil pipeline and truck receipt terminal located in Williams County, North Dakota that is capable of delivering up to 282,000 bopd of crude oil into an interconnecting pipeline for transportation to the Tioga Rail Terminal and to multiple third-party pipelines and storage facilities.        •  Tioga Rail Terminal: A 140,000 bopd crude oil and 30,000 boepd NGL rail loading terminal in Tioga, North Dakota that is connected to the Tioga Gas Plant, the Ramberg Terminal Facility and our crude oil gathering system.         •  Crude Oil Rail Cars: A total of 550 crude oil rail cars, which we operate as unit trains consisting of approximately 100 to 110 crude oil rail cars. These crude oil rail cars have been constructed to DOT-117 standards. In addition, at December 31, 2017, HIP also has 105 older specification crude oil rail cars. In 2016, we recorded an impairment charge against these older specification rail cars, which are not in service. See Note 3, Impairment in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.        •  Johnson’s Corner Header System: A crude oil pipeline header system located in McKenzie County, North Dakota that receives crude oil by pipeline from Hess and third-parties and delivers crude oil to third-party interstate pipeline systems. The facility has a delivery capacity of approximately 100,000 bopd of crude oil.    11      In 2018, the Partnership announced the formation of a 50/50 joint venture with Targa Resources Corp. to construct a new 200 mmcfd gas processing plant south of the Missouri River in McKenzie County, North Dakota, which is expected to be completed in the second half of 2018. The plant is expected to increase the Midstream segment’s total processing capacity in the Bakken to 350 mmcfd. As part of this project, HIP will construct new pipeline infrastructure to gather volumes for the new plant. The expected combined project costs attributable to our Midstream segment is $175 million.  Competition and Market Conditions See Item 1A. Risk Factors for a discussion of competition and market conditions. Other Items Emergency Preparedness and Response Plans and Procedures We have in place a series of business and asset-specific emergency preparedness, response and business continuity plans that detail procedures for rapid and effective emergency response and environmental mitigation activities. These plans are risk appropriate and are maintained, reviewed and updated as necessary to confirm their accuracy and suitability. Where appropriate, they are also reviewed and approved by the relevant host government authorities. Responder training and drills are routinely held worldwide to assess and continually improve the effectiveness of our plans. Our contractors, service providers, representatives from government agencies and, where applicable, joint venture partners participate in the drills to help ensure that emergency procedures are comprehensive and can be effectively implemented. To complement internal capabilities and to help ensure coverage for our global operations, we maintain membership contracts with a network of local, regional and global oil spill response and emergency response organizations. At the regional and global level, these organizations include Clean Gulf Associates (CGA), Marine Spill Response Corporation (MSRC), Marine Well Containment Company (MWCC), Wild Well Control (WWC), Subsea Well Intervention Service (SWIS) and Oil Spill Response Limited (OSRL). CGA and MSRC are domestic spill response organizations and MWCC provides the equipment and personnel to contain underwater well control incidents in the Gulf of Mexico. WWC provides firefighting, well control and engineering services globally. OSRL is a global response organization and is available, when needed, to assist us anywhere in the world. In addition to owning response assets in their own right, the organization maintains business relationships that provide immediate access to additional critical response support services if required. These owned response assets include nearly 300 recovery and storage vessels and barges, more than 250 skimmers, over 600,000 feet of boom, 9 capping stacks and significant quantities of dispersants and other ancillary equipment, including aircraft. In addition to external well control and oil spill response support, we have contracts with wildlife, environmental, meteorology, incident management, medical and security resources. If we were to engage these organizations to obtain additional critical response support services, we would fund such services and seek reimbursement under our insurance coverage, as described below. In certain circumstances, we pursue and enter into mutual aid agreements with other companies and government cooperatives to receive and provide oil spill response equipment and personnel support. We maintain close associations with emergency response organizations through our representation on the Executive Committees of CGA and MSRC, as well as the Board of Directors of OSRL. We continue to participate in a number of industry-wide task forces that are studying better ways to assess the risk of and prevent onshore and offshore incidents, access and control blowouts in subsea environments, and improve containment and recovery methods. The task forces are working closely with the oil and gas industry and international government agencies to implement improvements and increase the effectiveness of oil spill prevention, preparedness, response and recovery processes. Insurance Coverage and Indemnification We maintain insurance coverage that includes coverage for physical damage to our property, third-party liability, workers’ compensation and employers’ liability, general liability, sudden and accidental pollution and other coverage. This insurance coverage is subject to deductibles, exclusions and limitations and there is no assurance that such coverage will adequately protect us against liability from all potential consequences and damages.  The amount of insurance covering physical damage to our property and liability related to negative environmental effects resulting from a sudden and accidental pollution event, excluding Atlantic Named Windstorm coverage for which we are self‑insured, varies by asset, based on the asset's estimated replacement value or the estimated maximum loss. In the case of a catastrophic event, first party coverage consists of two tiers of insurance. The first $400 million of coverage is provided through an industry mutual insurance group. Above this $400 million threshold, insurance is carried which ranges in value    12      up to $1.11 billion in total, depending on the asset coverage level, as described above. The insurance programs covering physical damage to our property exclude business interruption protection for our E&P operations. Additionally, we carry insurance that provides third-party coverage for general liability, and sudden and accidental pollution, up to $1.08 billion, which coverage under a standard joint operating arrangement would be reduced to our participating interest. Our insurance policies renew at various dates each year. Future insurance coverage could increase in cost and may include higher deductibles or retentions, or additional exclusions or limitations. In addition, some forms of insurance may become unavailable in the future or unavailable on terms that are deemed economically acceptable. Generally, our drilling contracts (and most of our other offshore services contracts) provide for a mutual hold harmless indemnity structure whereby each party to the contract (the Corporation and Contractor) indemnifies the other party for injuries or damages to their personnel and property (and, often, those of its contractors/subcontractors) regardless of fault. Variations may include indemnity exclusions to the extent a claim is attributable to the gross negligence and/or willful misconduct of a party. Third‑party claims, on the other hand, are generally allocated on a fault basis. We are customarily responsible for, and indemnify the Contractor against, all claims including those from third‑parties, to the extent attributable to pollution or contamination by substances originating from our reservoirs or other property and the Contractor is responsible for and indemnifies us for all claims attributable to pollution emanating from the Contractor’s property. Variations may include indemnity exclusions to the extent a claim is attributable to the gross negligence and/or willful misconduct of a party. Additionally, we are generally liable for all of our own losses and most third‑party claims associated with catastrophic losses such as damage to reservoirs, blowouts, cratering and loss of hole, regardless of cause, although exceptions for losses attributable to gross negligence and/or willful misconduct do exist. Lastly some offshore services contracts include overall limitations of the Contractor’s liability equal to a fixed negotiated amount. Variations may include exclusions of all contractual indemnities from the liability cap. Under a standard joint operating agreement (JOA), each party is liable for all claims arising under the JOA, to the extent of its participating interest (operator or non-operator). Variations include indemnity exclusions when the claim is based upon the gross negligence and/or willful misconduct of the operator, in which case the operator is solely liable. The parties to the JOA may continue to be jointly and severally liable for claims made by third-parties in some jurisdictions. Further, under some production sharing contracts between a governmental entity and commercial parties, liability of the commercial parties to the government entity is joint and several. Environmental Compliance with various existing environmental and pollution control regulations imposed by federal, state, local and foreign governments is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations but increasingly stringent environmental regulations have resulted and will likely continue to result in higher capital expenditures and operating expenses for us and the oil and gas industry in general. We spent approximately $15 million in 2017 for environmental remediation. The level of other expenditures to comply with federal, state, local and foreign country environmental regulations is difficult to quantify as such costs are captured as mostly indistinguishable components of our capital expenditures and operating expenses. For further discussion of environmental matters see Environment, Health and Safety in Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Number of Employees At December 31, 2017, we had 2,075 employees. In January 2018, we eliminated approximately 300 of these positions.

Risk Factors  Our business activities and the value of our securities are subject to significant risks, including the risk factors described below. These risk factors could negatively affect our operations, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations, and as a result, holders and purchasers of our securities could lose part or all of their investments. It is possible that additional risks relating to our securities may be described in a prospectus supplement if we issue securities in the future. Our business and operating results are highly dependent on the market prices of crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas, which can be very volatile. Our estimated proved reserves, revenue, operating cash flows, operating margins, liquidity, financial condition and future earnings are highly dependent on the benchmark market prices of crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas, and our associated realized price differentials, which are volatile and influenced by numerous factors beyond our control. The major foreign oil producing countries, including members of OPEC, may exert considerable influence over the supply and price of crude oil and refined petroleum products. Their ability or inability to agree on a common policy on rates of production and other matters may have a significant impact on the oil markets. Other factors include, but are not limited to: worldwide and domestic supplies of and demand for crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas, political conditions and events (including instability, changes in governments, or armed conflict) around the world and in particular in crude oil or natural gas producing regions, the cost of exploring for, developing and producing crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas, the price and availability of alternative fuels or other forms of energy, the effect of energy conservation and environmental protection efforts and overall economic conditions globally. The sentiment of commodities trading markets as well as other supply and demand factors may also influence the selling prices of crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas. Average prices for 2017 were $50.85 per barrel for WTI (2016: $43.47; 2015: $48.76) and $54.74 per barrel for Brent (2016: $45.13; 2015: $53.60). In order to manage the potential volatility of cash flows and credit requirements, we maintain significant bank credit facilities. An inability to access, renew or replace such credit facilities or access other sources of funding as they mature would negatively impact our liquidity. If we fail to successfully increase our reserves, our future crude oil and natural gas production will be adversely impacted. We own or have access to a finite amount of oil and gas reserves, which will be depleted over time. Replacement of oil and gas production and reserves, including proved undeveloped reserves, is subject to successful exploration drilling, development activities, and enhanced recovery programs. Therefore, future oil and gas production is dependent on technical success in finding and developing additional hydrocarbon reserves. Exploration activity involves the interpretation of seismic and other geological and geophysical data, which does not always successfully predict the presence of commercial quantities of hydrocarbons. Drilling risks include unexpected adverse conditions, irregularities in pressure or formations, equipment failure, blowouts and weather interruptions. Future developments may be affected by unforeseen reservoir conditions, which negatively affect recovery factors or flow rates. Reserve replacement can also be achieved through acquisition. Similar risks, however, may be encountered in the production of oil and gas on properties acquired from others. In addition to the technical risks to reserve replacement, replacing reserves and developing future production is also influenced by the price of crude oil and natural gas and costs of drilling and development activities. Lower crude oil and natural gas prices, may have the effect of reducing capital available for exploration and development activity and may render certain development projects uneconomic or delay their completion and may result in negative revisions to existing reserves while increasing drilling and development costs could negatively affect expected economic returns. There are inherent uncertainties in estimating quantities of proved reserves and discounted future net cash flows, and actual quantities may be lower than estimated. Numerous uncertainties exist in estimating quantities of proved reserves and future net revenues from those reserves. Actual future production, oil and gas prices, revenues, taxes, capital expenditures, operating expenses, and quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves may vary substantially from those assumed in the estimates and could materially affect the estimated quantities of our proved reserves and the related future net revenues. In addition, reserve estimates may be subject to downward or upward changes based on production performance, purchases or sales of properties, results of future development, prevailing oil and gas prices, production sharing contracts, which may decrease reserves as crude oil and natural gas prices increase, and other factors. Crude oil prices declined significantly in 2015 and to a lesser extent in 2016, relative to preceding years, resulting in reductions to our reported proved reserves. In contrast, crude oil prices improved somewhat in 2017 resulting in increases to our reported proved reserves. If crude oil prices in 2018 average below prices used to determine proved reserves at December 31, 2017, it could have an adverse effect on our estimates of proved reserve volumes and on the value of our business. See Crude Oil and Natural Gas Reserves in Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates in Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. We do not always control decisions made under joint operating agreements and the parties under such agreements may fail to meet their obligations. We conduct many of our E&P operations through joint operating agreements with other parties under which we may not control decisions, either because we do not have a controlling interest or are not operator under the agreement. There is risk that these parties may at any time have economic, business, or legal interests or goals that    14      are inconsistent with ours, and therefore decisions may be made which are not what we believe is in our best interest. Moreover, parties to these agreements may be unable to meet their economic or other obligations and we may be required to fulfill those obligations alone. In either case, the value of our investment may be adversely affected. We are subject to changing laws and regulations and other governmental actions that can significantly and adversely affect our business. Federal, state, local, territorial and foreign laws and regulations relating to tax increases and retroactive tax claims, disallowance of tax credits and deductions, expropriation or nationalization of property, mandatory government participation, cancellation or amendment of contract rights, imposition of capital controls or blocking of funds, changes in import and export regulations, limitations on access to exploration and development opportunities, anti-bribery or anti-corruption laws, as well as other political developments may affect our operations. We have substantial capital requirements, and we may not be able to obtain needed financing on satisfactory terms, if at all. The exploration, development and production of crude oil and natural gas involves substantial costs, which may not be fully funded from operations. For example, in 2017, we had a significant net loss and, unless commodity prices are considerably higher through 2018, we are forecasting a net loss for 2018. Two of the three major credit rating agencies that rate our debt have assigned an investment grade rating. Although, currently we do not have any borrowings under our long-term credit facility, a ratings downgrade, continued weakness in the oil and gas industry or negative outcomes within commodity and financial markets could adversely impact our access to capital markets by increasing the costs of financing, or by impacting our ability to obtain financing on satisfactory terms, or at all. In addition, a ratings downgrade may require that we issue letters of credit or provide other forms of collateral under certain contractual requirements. Any inability to access capital markets could adversely impact our financial adaptability and our ability to execute our strategy and may also expose us to heightened exposure to credit risk. Political instability in areas where we operate can adversely affect our business. Some of the international areas in which we operate, and the partners with whom we operate, are politically less stable than other areas and partners and may be subject to civil unrest, conflict, insurgency, geographic territorial border disputes, corruption, security risks and labor unrest. Political and civil unrest in North Africa and the Middle East has affected and may affect our operations in these areas as well as oil and gas markets generally. The threat of terrorism around the world also poses additional risks to the operations of the oil and gas industry. Our oil and gas operations are subject to environmental risks and environmental laws and regulations that can result in significant costs and liabilities. Our oil and gas operations, like those of the industry, are subject to environmental risks such as oil spills, produced water spills, gas leaks and ruptures and discharges of substances or gases that could expose us to substantial liability for pollution or other environmental damage. Our operations are also subject to numerous U.S. federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations. Non‑compliance with these laws and regulations may subject us to administrative, civil or criminal penalties, remedial clean-ups and natural resource damages or other liabilities. In addition, increasingly stringent environmental regulations have resulted and will likely continue to result in higher capital expenditures and operating expenses for us and the oil and gas industry in general. Similarly, we have material legal obligations to dismantle, remove and abandon production facilities and wells that will occur many years in the future, in most cases. These estimates may be impacted by future changes in regulations and other uncertainties. Concerns have been raised in certain jurisdictions where we have operations concerning the safety and environmental impact of the drilling and development of shale oil and gas resources, particularly hydraulic fracturing, water usage, flaring of associated natural gas and air emissions. While we believe that these operations can be conducted safely and with minimal impact on the environment, regulatory bodies are responding to these concerns and may impose moratoriums and new regulations on such drilling operations that would likely have the effect of prohibiting or delaying such operations and increasing their cost. Climate change initiatives may result in significant operational changes and expenditures, reduced demand for our products and adversely affect our business. We recognize that climate change is a global environmental concern. Continuing political and social attention to the issue of climate change has resulted in both existing and pending international agreements and national, regional or local legislation and regulatory measures to limit greenhouse gas emissions. These agreements and measures may require, or could result in future legislation and regulatory measures that require, significant equipment modifications, operational changes, taxes, or purchase of emission credits to reduce emission of greenhouse gases from our operations, which may result in substantial capital expenditures and compliance, operating, maintenance and remediation costs. In addition, our production is sold to third parties that produce petroleum fuels, which through normal end user consumption result in the emission of greenhouse gases. Regulatory initiatives to reduce the use of these fuels may reduce demand for crude oil and other hydrocarbons and have an adverse effect on our sales volumes, revenues and margins. The imposition and enforcement of stringent greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets could severely and adversely impact the oil and gas industry and significantly reduce the value of our business. Furthermore, increasing attention to climate change risks has resulted in increased likelihood of governmental investigations and private litigation, which could increase    15      our costs or otherwise adversely affect our business. For example, in 2017 certain municipalities in California separately filed lawsuits against over 30 fossil fuel producers, including us, for alleged damages purportedly caused by climate change. Our industry is highly competitive and many of our competitors are larger and have greater resources than we have. The petroleum industry is highly competitive and very capital intensive. We encounter competition from numerous companies in each of our activities, including acquiring rights to explore for crude oil and natural gas. To a lesser extent, we are also in competition with producers of alternative fuels or other forms of energy, including wind, solar and electric power, and in the future could face increasing competition due to the development and adoption of new technologies. Many competitors, including national oil companies, are larger and have substantially greater resources. Increased competition for worldwide oil and gas assets could significantly increase the cost of acquiring oil and gas assets. In addition, competition for drilling services, technical expertise and equipment may affect the availability of technical personnel and drilling rigs, resulting in increased capital and operating costs. Catastrophic events, whether naturally occurring or man‑made, may materially affect our operations and financial conditions. Our oil and gas operations are subject to unforeseen occurrences which have affected us from time to time and which may damage or destroy assets, interrupt operations and have other significant adverse effects. Examples of catastrophic risks include hurricanes, fires, explosions, blowouts, pipeline interruptions and ruptures, severe weather, geological events, labor disputes or cyber‑attacks. We maintain insurance coverage against many, but not all, potential losses and liabilities in amounts we deem prudent, including for property and casualty losses. There can be no assurance that such insurance will adequately protect us against liability from all potential consequences and damages. Moreover, some forms of insurance may be unavailable in the future or be available only on terms that are deemed economically unacceptable. Significant time delays between the estimated and actual occurrence of critical events associated with development projects may result in material negative economic consequences. As part of our business, we are involved in large development projects, the completion of which may be delayed beyond what was originally planned. Such examples include, but are not limited to, delays in receiving necessary approvals from project members or regulatory agencies, timely access to necessary equipment, availability of necessary personnel, construction delays, unfavorable weather conditions and equipment failures. This may lead to delays and differences between estimated and actual timing of critical events. These delays could impact our future results of operations and cash flows. Departures of key members from our senior management team, and/or difficulty in recruiting and retaining adequate numbers of experienced technical personnel, could negatively impact our ability to deliver on our strategic goals. Our future success depends upon the continued service of key members of our senior management team, who play an important role in developing and implementing our strategy. The departure of key members of senior management or an inability to recruit and retain adequate numbers of experienced technical and professional personnel in the necessary locations may prevent us from executing our strategy in full or, in part, which could negatively impact our business. We are dependent on oilfield service companies for items including drilling rigs, equipment, supplies and skilled labor. An inability or significant delay in securing these services, or a high cost thereof, may result in material negative economic consequences. The availability and cost of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies and skilled labor will fluctuate over time given the cyclical nature of the E&P industry. As a result, we may encounter difficulties in obtaining required services or could face an increase in cost. These consequences may impact our ability to run our operations and to deliver projects on time with the potential for material negative economic consequences. We manage commodity price and other risks through our risk management function but such activities may impede our ability to benefit from commodity price increases and can expose us to similar potential counterparty credit risk as impacts amounts due from the sale of hydrocarbons. We may enter into additional commodity price hedging arrangements to protect us from commodity price declines. These arrangements may, depending on the instruments used and the level of increases involved, limit any potential upside from commodity price increases. As with accounts receivable we may be exposed to potential economic loss should a counterparty be unable or unwilling to perform their obligations under the terms of a hedging agreement. In addition, we are exposed to risks related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency values, and may engage in hedging activities to mitigate related volatility. One of our subsidiaries is the general partner of a publicly traded master limited partnership, Hess Midstream Partners LP. The responsibilities associated with being a general partner expose the us to a broader range of legal liabilities. Our control of Hess Midstream Partners LP bestows upon us additional fiduciary duties including, but not limited to, the obligations associated with managing potential conflicts of interests, additional reporting requirements from the Securities and Exchange Commission and the provision of tax information to unit holders of Hess Midstream Partners LP. These heightened duties expose us to additional potential for legal claims that may have a material negative economic impact on our shareholders. Moreover, these increased duties may lead to an increase in compliance costs and may divert management resource from our other operations.   16      Disruption, failure or cyber security breaches affecting or targeting computer, telecommunications systems, and infrastructure used by the Company may materially impact our business and operations. Computers and telecommunication systems are used to conduct our exploration, development and production activities and have become an integral part of our business. We use these systems to analyze and store financial and operating data and to communicate within our company and with outside business partners. Technical system flaws, power loss, cyber security risks, including cyber or phishing-attacks, unauthorized access, malicious software, data privacy breaches by employees or others with authorized access, ransomware, and other cyber security issues could compromise our computer and telecommunications systems and result in disruptions to our business operations or the access, disclosure or loss of our data and proprietary information. In addition, computers control oil and gas production, processing equipment, and distribution systems globally and are necessary to deliver our production to market. A disruption, failure or a cyber breach of these operating systems, or of the networks and infrastructure on which they rely, could damage critical production, distribution and/or storage assets, delay or prevent delivery to markets, and make it difficult or impossible to accurately account for production and settle transactions. As a result, a disruption, failure or a cyber breach of these operating systems, or of the networks and infrastructure on which they rely and any resulting investigation or remediation costs, litigation or regulatory action could have a material adverse impact on our cash flows and results of operations, reputation and competitiveness. We routinely experience attempts by external parties to penetrate and attack our networks and systems. Although such attempts to date have not resulted in any material breaches, disruptions, or loss of business-critical information, our systems and procedures for protecting against such attacks and mitigating such risks may prove to be insufficient in the future and such attacks could have an adverse impact on our business and operations, including damage to our reputation and competitiveness, remediation costs, litigation or regulatory actions. In addition, as technologies evolve and these cyber security attacks become more sophisticated, we may incur significant costs to upgrade or enhance our security measures to protect against such attacks and we may face difficulties in fully anticipating or implementing adequate preventive measures or mitigating potential harm.
