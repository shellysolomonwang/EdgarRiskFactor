Item 1A.    Risk Factors Related to Our Business and Operations       Our business activities and the value of our securities are subject to significant risk factors, including those described below. The risk factors described below could negatively affect our operations, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations, and as a result, holders and purchasers of our securities could lose part or all of their investments. It is possible additional risks relating to our securities may be described in a prospectus supplement if we issue securities in the future.     Commodity Price Risk: Our estimated proved reserves, revenue, operating cash flows, operating margins, future earnings and trading operations are highly dependent on the prices of crude oil, natural gas and refined petroleum products, which are influenced by numerous factors beyond our control. Historically these prices have been very volatile. The major foreign oil producing countries, including members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), exert considerable influence over the supply and price of crude oil and refined petroleum products. Their ability or inability to agree on a common policy on rates of production and other matters has a significant impact on the oil markets. The commodities trading markets may also influence the selling prices of crude oil, natural gas and refined petroleum products. A significant downward trend in commodity prices would have a material adverse effect on our revenues, profitability and cash flow and could result in a reduction in the carrying value of our oil and gas assets, goodwill and proved oil and gas reserves. To the extent that we engage in hedging activities to mitigate commodity price volatility, we will not realize the benefit of price increases above the hedged price.     Technical Risk: We own or have access to a finite amount of oil and gas reserves which will be depleted over time. Replacement of oil and gas reserves is subject to successful exploration drilling, development activities, and enhanced recovery programs. Therefore, future oil and gas production is dependent on technical success in finding and developing additional hydrocarbon reserves. Exploration activity involves the interpretation of seismic and other geological and geophysical data, which does not always successfully predict the presence of commercial quantities of hydrocarbons. Drilling risks include adverse unexpected conditions, irregularities in pressure or formations, equipment failure, blowouts and weather interruptions. Future developments may be affected by unforeseen reservoir conditions which negatively affect recovery factors or flow rates. The costs of drilling and development activities have also been increasing, which could negatively affect expected economic returns. Although due diligence is used in evaluating acquired oil and gas properties, similar uncertainties may be encountered in the production of oil and gas on properties acquired from others.     Oil and Gas Reserves and Discounted Future Net Cash Flow Risks: Numerous uncertainties exist in estimating quantities of proved reserves and future net revenues from those reserves. Actual future production, oil and gas prices, revenues, taxes, capital expenditures, operating expenses, geologic success and quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves may vary substantially from those assumed in the estimates and could materially affect the estimated quantities and future net revenues of our proved reserves. In addition, reserve estimates may be subject to downward or upward revisions based on production performance, purchases or sales of properties, results of future development, prevailing oil and gas prices, production sharing contracts which may decrease reserves as crude oil and natural gas prices increase, and other factors.     Political Risk: Federal, state, local, territorial and foreign laws and regulations relating to tax increases and retroactive tax claims, expropriation of property, mandatory government participation, cancellation or amendment of contract rights, and changes in import regulations, as well as other political developments may affect our operations. Some of the international areas in which we operate may be politically less stable than our domestic operations. In addition, the increasing threat of terrorism around the world poses additional risks to the operations of the oil and gas industry. In our M&R segment, we market motor fuels through lessee-dealers and wholesalers in    10    Table of Contents   certain states where legislation prohibits producers or refiners of crude oil from directly engaging in retail marketing of motor fuels. Similar legislation has been periodically proposed in the U.S. Congress and in various other states.     Environmental Risk: Our oil and gas operations, like those of the industry, are subject to environmental hazards such as oil spills, produced water spills, gas leaks and ruptures and discharges of substances or gases that could expose us to substantial liability for pollution or other environmental damage. Our operations are also subject to numerous United States federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations. Non-compliance with these laws and regulations may subject us to administrative, civil or criminal penalties, remedial clean-ups and natural resource damages or other liabilities. In addition, increasingly stringent environmental regulations, particularly relating to the production of motor and other fuels and the potential for controls on greenhouse gas emissions, have resulted, and will likely continue to result, in higher capital expenditures and operating expenses for us and the oil and gas industry in general.     Competitive Risk: The petroleum industry is highly competitive and very capital intensive. We encounter competition from numerous companies in each of our activities, including acquiring rights to explore for crude oil and natural gas, and in purchasing and marketing of refined products and natural gas. Many competitors, including national oil companies, are larger and have substantially greater resources. We are also in competition with producers and marketers of other forms of energy. Increased competition for worldwide oil and gas assets has significantly increased the cost of acquisitions. In addition, competition for drilling services, technical expertise and equipment has affected the availability of technical personnel and drilling rigs and has increased capital and operating costs.     Catastrophic Risk: Although we maintain a level of insurance coverage consistent with industry practices against property and casualty losses, our oil and gas operations are subject to unforeseen occurrences which may damage or destroy assets or interrupt operations. Examples of catastrophic risks include hurricanes, fires, explosions and blowouts. These occurrences have affected us from time to time. During 2005, our annual Gulf of Mexico production of crude oil and natural gas was reduced by 7,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) due to the impact of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.
