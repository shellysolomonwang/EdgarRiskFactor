Certain Risks   The following risks and uncertainties, together with other information set forth in this Form 10-K, should be carefully considered by current and future investors in our securities. If any of the following risks and uncertainties develop into actual events, this could have a material adverse affect on our business, financial condition or results of operations and could negatively impact the value of our common stock.   Oil and gas prices fluctuate due to a number of uncontrollable factors, creating a component of uncertainty in our development plans and overall operations. Continued declines in prices adversely affect our financial results and rate of growth in proved reserves and production.   The oil and gas markets are very volatile, and we cannot predict future oil and natural gas prices. The price we receive for our oil and natural gas production heavily influences our revenue, profitability, access to capital and future rate of growth. The prices we receive for our production depend on numerous factors beyond our control. These factors include, but are not limited to, changes in global supply and demand for oil and gas, the actions of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, the level of global oil and gas exploration and production activity, weather conditions, technological advances affecting energy consumption, domestic and foreign governmental regulations, proximity and capacity of oil and gas pipelines and other transportation facilities and the price and technological advancement of alternative fuels.  12      Table of Contents  During the fourth quarter of 2008, severe disruptions in the credit markets and reductions in global economic activity caused significant decreases in oil and gas prices. Oil and gas prices fell 50-70% from the mid-year 2008 peak to the end of the year and 30-60% from the third to the fourth-quarter 2008. The dramatic decrease in prices significantly decreased the amount available to invest in exploration and development drilling, the present value of our proved reserves and our stock price and corresponding market capitalization. As a result of the drop in commodity prices in 2008, we recorded $1.4 billion after-tax, full-cost ceiling test write-down of proved properties book-value.   Our proved oil and gas reserves and production volumes decrease in quantity unless we successfully replace the reserves we produce with new discoveries or acquisitions. For the foreseeable future, we expect to make substantial capital investments for the exploration and development of new oil and gas reserves to replace the reserves we produce and to increase our total proved reserves. Historically, we have paid for these types of capital expenditures with cash flow provided by our production operations. Low prices also reduce the amount of oil and gas that we can economically produce and may cause us to curtail, delay or defer certain exploration and development projects. Moreover, our ability to borrow under our bank credit facility and to raise additional debt or equity capital to fund acquisitions would also be impacted.   If oil and natural gas prices decrease further, we may be required to take additional write-downs of the carrying values of our oil and gas properties and/or our goodwill.   Accounting rules require that we review the carrying value of our oil and gas properties and goodwill for possible impairment at the end of each reporting period. If prices fall further, we may incur additional impairment charges in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period taken.   The global financial crisis may have impacts on our business and financial condition that we currently cannot predict.   The continued credit crisis and related turmoil in the global financial system may have an impact on our business and our financial condition, and we may face challenges if conditions in the financial markets do not improve. Our ability to access the capital markets may be restricted at a time when we would like, or need, to raise financing, which could have an impact on our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions. The economic situation could have an impact on our lenders or customers, causing them to fail to meet their obligations to us.   Failure of our exploration and development program to find commercial quantities of new oil and gas reserves could negatively affect our financial results and future rate of growth.   Most of our wells produce from reservoirs characterized by high initial production rates which decline rapidly and stabilize within three to five years. In order to replace the reserves depleted by production and to maintain or grow our total proved reserves and overall production levels, we must locate and develop new oil and gas reserves or acquire producing properties from others. While we may from time to time seek to acquire proved reserves, our main business strategy is to grow through drilling. Without successful exploration and development, our reserves, production and revenues could decline rapidly, which would negatively impact our results of operations.   Exploration and development involves numerous risks, including the risk that no commercially productive oil or gas reservoirs will be discovered. Exploration and development can also be unprofitable, not only from dry wells, but from productive wells that do not produce sufficient reserves to return a profit.   Our drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of several factors, including unforeseen poor drilling conditions, title problems, unexpected pressure or irregularities in formations, equipment failures, accidents, adverse weather conditions, compliance with environmental and other  13      Table of Contents  governmental requirements, and the cost of, or shortages or delays in the availability of, drilling rigs and related equipment.   The high-rate production characteristics of our properties subject us to high reserve replacement needs and require significant capital expenditures to replace our reserves.   Unless we conduct successful development activities or acquire properties containing proved reserves, our proved reserves will decline as they are produced. Producing natural gas and oil reservoirs are generally characterized by declining production rates that vary depending on reservoir characteristics and other factors. Because of the high-rate production profiles of our properties, replacing produced reserves is more difficult for us than for companies whose reserves have longer-life production profiles. This imposes greater reinvestment risk for our company as we may not be able to continue to economically replace our reserves.   Our proved reserve estimates may be inaccurate and future net cash flows are uncertain.   Estimates of total proved oil and gas reserves (consisting of proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves) and associated future net cash flow depend on a number of variables and assumptions. Among others, changes in any of the following factors may cause estimates to vary considerably from actual results:    •production rates, reservoir pressure, and other subsurface information;   •future oil and gas prices;   •assumed effects of governmental regulation;   •future operating costs;   •future property, severance, excise and other taxes incidental to oil and gas operations;   •capital expenditures;   •workover and remedial costs; and   •Federal and state income taxes.    The estimation of the category of proved undeveloped reserves can be subject to an even greater possibility of revision. At December 31, 2008, 18 percent of our total proved reserves are categorized as proved undeveloped. Of these proved undeveloped reserves, 89 percent are related to a project in Wyoming.   Our proved oil and gas reserve estimates are prepared by Cimarex engineers in accordance with guidelines established by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). DeGolyer and MacNaughton, independent petroleum engineers, reviewed our reserve estimates for properties that comprised at least 80 percent of the discounted future net cash flows before income taxes, using a 10 percent discount rate, as of December 31, 2008.  14                  Table of Contents   The values referred to in this report should not be construed as the current market value of our proved reserves. In accordance with SEC guidelines, the estimated discounted net cash flow from proved reserves is based on prices and costs as of the date of the estimate, whereas actual future prices and costs may be materially different.   We have been an early entrant into new or emerging plays; as a result, our drilling results in these areas are uncertain, and the value of our undeveloped acreage will decline and we may incur impairment charges if drilling results are unsuccessful.   New or emerging plays have limited or no production history. Consequently, we are unable to use past drilling results in those areas to help predict our future drilling results. Therefore, our cost of drilling, completing and operating wells in these areas may be higher than initially expected, and the value of our undeveloped acreage will decline if drilling results are unsuccessful. Furthermore, if drilling results are unsuccessful, we may be required to write down the carrying value of our undeveloped acreage in new or emerging plays.   Our business depends on oil and natural gas transportation facilities, most of which are owned by others.   The marketability of our oil and natural gas production depends in large part on the availability, proximity and capacity of pipeline systems owned by third parties. The lack of available capacity on these systems and facilities could result in the shut-in of producing wells or the delay or discontinuance of drilling plans for properties. The lack of availability of these facilities for an extended period of time could negatively affect our revenues. Federal and state regulation of oil and natural gas production and transportation, tax and energy policies, changes in supply and demand, pipeline pressures, damage to or destruction of pipelines and general economic conditions could adversely affect our ability to produce, gather and transport oil and natural gas.   The differential between the NYMEX or other benchmark price of oil and natural gas and the wellhead price we receive could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.   The prices that we receive for our oil and natural gas production generally trade at a discount to the relevant benchmark prices, such as NYMEX, that are used for calculating hedge positions. The difference between the benchmark price and the price we receive is called a differential. We cannot accurately predict oil and natural gas differentials. Increases in the differential between the benchmark price for oil and natural gas and the wellhead price we receive could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.   Competition in our industry is intense and many of our competitors have greater financial and technological resources.   We operate in the competitive area of oil and gas exploration and production. Many of our competitors are large, well-established companies that have larger operating staffs and greater capital resources than we do. These companies may be able to pay more for exploratory prospects and productive oil and gas properties and may be able to define, evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit.   We are subject to complex laws and regulations that can adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of doing business.   Exploration, development, production and sale of oil and gas are subject to extensive Federal, state and local laws and regulations, including complex environmental laws. We may be required to make large expenditures to comply with environmental and other governmental regulations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the suspension or termination of our operations and subject us to  15      Table of Contents  administrative, civil and criminal penalties. Matters subject to regulation include discharge permits for drilling operations, drilling bonds, spacing of wells, unitization and pooling of properties, environmental protection, and taxation. Our operations create the risk of environmental liabilities to the government or third parties for any unlawful discharge of oil, gas or other pollutants into the air, soil or water. In the event of environmental violations, we may be charged with remedial costs. Pollution and similar environmental risks generally are not fully insurable. Such liabilities and costs could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.   Our limited ability to influence operations and associated costs on properties not operated by us could result in economic losses that are partially beyond our control.   Other companies operate approximately 19 percent of our net production. Our success in properties operated by others depends upon a number of factors outside of our control, including timing and amount of capital expenditures, the operator's expertise and financial resources, approval of other participants in drilling wells, selection of technology and maintenance of safety and environmental standards. Our dependence on the operator and other working interest owners for these projects could prevent the realization of our targeted returns on capital in drilling or acquisition activities.   Our business involves many operating risks that may result in substantial losses for which insurance may be unavailable or inadequate.   Our operations are subject to hazards and risks inherent in drilling for oil and gas, such as fires, natural disasters, explosions, formations with abnormal pressures, casing collapses, uncontrollable flows of underground gas, blowouts, surface cratering, pipeline ruptures or cement failures, and environmental hazards such as natural gas leaks, oil spills and discharges of toxic gases. Any of these risks can cause substantial losses resulting from injury or loss of life, damage to or destruction of property, natural resources and equipment, pollution and other environmental damages, regulatory investigations and penalties, suspension of our operations and repair and remediation costs. In addition, our liability for environmental hazards may include conditions created by the previous owners of properties that we purchase or lease.   We maintain insurance coverage against some, but not all, potential losses. We do not believe that insurance coverage for all environmental damages that could occur is available at a reasonable cost. Losses could occur for uninsurable or uninsured risks, or in amounts in excess of existing insurance coverage. The occurrence of an event that is not fully covered by insurance could harm our financial condition and results of operation.   We may not be able to generate enough cash flow to meet our debt obligations.   At December 31, 2008, we had total long-term debt of $591.2 million, consisting of $220 million of bank debt, $350 million of unsecured 7.125% Senior Notes and $21.2 million of Convertible Notes ($19.45 million face value). Subject to the limits contained in the agreements governing our senior revolving credit facility, we would have been able to incur up to $1 billion of debt as of December 31, 2008, only $500 million of which is currently committed. We have demands on our cash resources in addition to interest expense and principal on our long-term debt, including, among others, operating expenses and capital expenditures.   Our ability to pay the principal and interest on our long-term debt and to satisfy our other liabilities will depend upon our future performance and our ability to repay or refinance our debt as it becomes due. Our future operating performance and ability to refinance will be affected by economic and capital market conditions, our financial condition, results of operations and prospects and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. Our ability to meet our debt service obligations may also be affected by changes in  16      Table of Contents  prevailing interest rates, as borrowing under our existing senior revolving credit facility and our Convertible Notes bear interest at floating rates.   Our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations, nor could there be adequate future sources of capital to enable us to service our indebtedness, or to fund our other liquidity needs. If we are unable to service our indebtedness and fund our operating costs, we will be forced to adopt alternative strategies that may include:    •reducing or delaying capital expenditures;   •seeking additional debt financing or equity capital;   •selling assets; or   •restructuring or refinancing debt.    We may be unable to complete any such strategies on satisfactory terms, if at all. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt obligations, or to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms, would materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.   The instruments governing our indebtedness contain various covenants limiting the discretion of our management in operating our business.   The indentures governing our senior subordinated notes and credit agreement contain various restrictive covenants that may potentially limit our management's discretion in certain respects. In particular, these agreements will limit our and our subsidiaries' ability to, among other things:    •pay dividends on, redeem or repurchase our capital stock or redeem or repurchase our subordinated debt;   •make loans to others;   •make investments;   •incur additional indebtedness or issue preferred stock;   •create certain liens;   •sell assets;   •enter into agreements that restrict dividends or other payments from our restricted subsidiaries to us;   •consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of the assets of us and our restricted subsidiaries taken as a whole;   •engage in transactions with affiliates;   •enter into hedging contracts;   •create unrestricted subsidiaries; and   •enter into sale and leaseback transactions.    In addition, our revolving credit agreement requires us to maintain a debt to EBITDA ratio (as defined in the credit agreement) of less than 3.0 to 1 and a working capital ratio of greater than 1 to 1. Also, the indentures under which we issued our senior unsecured notes restrict us from incurring additional indebtedness, subject to certain exceptions, unless our fixed charge coverage ratio (as defined in the indentures) is at least 2.25 to 1. If we were in violation of this covenant, then we may not incur  17      Table of Contents additional indebtedness above our $1.0 billion revolving credit facility. See Note 6, Long-term Debt, in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.   If we fail to comply with the restrictions in the indentures governing our senior notes or credit facility or any other subsequent financing agreements, a default may allow the creditors, if the agreements so provide, to accelerate the related indebtedness as well as any other indebtedness to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies. In addition, lenders may be able to terminate any commitments they had made to make available further funds.   Our acquisition activities may not be successful, which may hinder our replacement of reserves and adversely affect our results of operations.   We evaluate opportunities and engage in bidding and negotiating for acquisitions, some of which are substantial. Under certain circumstances, we may pursue acquisitions of businesses that complement or expand our current business and acquisition and development of new exploration prospects that complement or expand our prospect inventory. We may not be successful in identifying or acquiring any material property interests, which could hinder us in replacing our reserves and adversely affect our financial results and rate of growth. Even if we do identify attractive opportunities, there is no assurance that we will be able to complete the acquisition of the business or prospect on commercially acceptable terms. If we do complete an acquisition, we must anticipate difficulties in integrating its operations, systems, technology, management and other personnel with our own. These difficulties may disrupt our ongoing operations, distract our management and employees and increase our expenses.   Competition for experienced, technical personnel may negatively impact our operations.   Our exploratory and development drilling success depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain experienced professional personnel. The loss of any key executives or other key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operations. In particular, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, F.H. Merelli, has over 48 years of oil and gas experience and is well known in the industry. The loss of his services for any reason could adversely affect our business, revenues and results of operations. As we continue to grow our asset base and the scope of our operations, our future profitability will depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, particularly individuals with a strong background in geology, geophysics, engineering and operations.   There are inherent limitations in all control systems, and misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.   While we have taken actions designed to address compliance with the internal control, disclosure control and other requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC implementing these requirements, there are inherent limitations in its ability to control all circumstances. See Item 9A of this report for a complete discussion of controls and procedures. Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our internal controls and disclosure controls will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. In addition, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefit of controls must be relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, in our company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or mistakes. Further, controls can be circumvented by individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more persons, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all  18      Table of Contents  potential future conditions. Over time, a control may be inadequate because of changes in conditions, such as growth of the company or increased transaction volume, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of inherent limitations in a control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.   The Cimarex certificate of incorporation, by-laws and stockholders' rights plan include provisions that could discourage an unsolicited corporate takeover and could prevent stockholders from realizing a premium on their investment.   The certificate of incorporation and by-laws of Cimarex provide for a classified board of directors with staggered terms, restrict the ability of stockholders to take action by written consent and prevent stockholders from calling a meeting of the stockholders. In addition, Delaware General Corporation Law imposes restrictions on business combinations with interested parties. Cimarex also has adopted a stockholders' rights plan. The stockholders' rights plan, the certificate of incorporation and the by-laws may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of Cimarex, even if the change in control might be beneficial to Cimarex stockholders.
