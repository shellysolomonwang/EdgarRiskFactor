Item 1A. RISK FACTORS  You should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Each of these risk factors could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition, as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock.  Our operating results, our future rate of growth and the carrying value of our assets are exposed to the effects of changing commodity prices and refining margins.  Our revenues, operating results and future rate of growth are highly dependent on the prices we receive for our crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, natural gas liquids, LNG and refined products. The factors influencing these prices are beyond our control. Lower crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, natural gas liquids, LNG and refined products prices may reduce the amount of these commodities we can produce economically, which may have a material adverse effect on our revenues, operating income and cash flows.  Unless we successfully add to our existing proved reserves, our future crude oil, bitumen and natural gas production will decline, resulting in an adverse impact to our business.  The rate of production from upstream fields generally declines as reserves are depleted. Except to the extent that we conduct successful exploration and development activities, or, through engineering studies, identify additional or secondary recovery reserves, our proved reserves will decline materially as we produce crude oil and natural gas. Accordingly, to the extent we are unsuccessful in replacing the crude oil and natural gas we produce with good prospects for future production, our business will experience reduced cash flows and results of operations.  Any material change in the factors and assumptions underlying our estimates of crude oil, bitumen and natural gas reserves could impair the quantity and value of those reserves.  Our proved reserve information included in this annual report has been derived from engineering estimates prepared or reviewed by our personnel. Any significant future price changes could have a material effect on the quantity and present value of our proved reserves. Future reserve revisions could also result from changes in, among other things, governmental regulation. Reserve estimation is a process that involves estimating volumes to be recovered from underground accumulations of crude oil, bitumen and natural gas that cannot be directly measured. As a result, different petroleum engineers, each using industry-accepted geologic and engineering practices and scientific methods, may produce different estimates of reserves and future net cash flows based on the same available data. Any changes in the factors and assumptions underlying our estimates of these items could result in a material negative impact to the volume of reserves reported.  We expect to continue to incur substantial capital expenditures and operating costs as a result of our compliance with existing and future environmental laws and regulations. Likewise, future environmental laws and regulations may impact or limit our current business plans and reduce demand for our products.  Our businesses are subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. These laws and regulations continue to increase in both number and complexity and affect our operations with respect to, among other things:       •   The discharge of pollutants into the environment.        •   Emissions into the atmosphere (such as nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide and mercury emissions, and greenhouse gas emissions as they are, or may become, regulated).        •   The handling, use, storage, transportation, disposal and clean up of hazardous materials and hazardous and nonhazardous wastes.        •   The dismantlement, abandonment and restoration of our properties and facilities at the end of their useful lives.        •   Exploration and production activities in environmentally sensitive areas, such as offshore environments, arctic fields, oil sands reservoirs and shale gas plays.    24    Table of Contents     We have incurred and will continue to incur substantial capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures as a result of these laws and regulations. To the extent these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in future periods could be materially adversely affected.  Although our business operations are designed and operated to accommodate expected climatic conditions, to the extent there are significant changes in the Earth’s climate, such as more severe or frequent weather conditions in the markets we serve or the areas where our assets reside, we could incur increased expenses, our operations could be materially impacted, and demand for our products could fall.  In addition, in response to the Deepwater Horizon incident, the United States, as well as other countries where we do business, may make changes to their laws or regulations governing offshore operations that could have a material adverse effect on our business.  Domestic and worldwide political and economic developments could damage our operations and materially reduce our profitability and cash flows.  Actions of the U.S., state and local governments through tax and other legislation, executive order and commercial restrictions could reduce our operating profitability both in the United States and abroad. The U.S. government can prevent or restrict us from doing business in foreign countries. These restrictions and those of foreign governments have in the past limited our ability to operate in, or gain access to, opportunities in various countries. Actions by both the United States and host governments have affected operations significantly in the past, such as the expropriation of our oil assets by the Venezuelan government, and may continue to do so in the future.  Local political and economic factors in international markets could have a material adverse effect on us. Approximately 67 percent of our hydrocarbon production was derived from production outside the United States in both 2009 and 2010, and 56 percent of our proved reserves, as of December 31, 2010, were located outside the United States. We are subject to risks associated with operations in international markets, including changes in foreign governmental policies relating to crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, natural gas liquids or refined product pricing and taxation, other political, economic or diplomatic developments, changing political conditions and international monetary fluctuations.  Changes in governmental regulations may impose price controls and limitations on production of crude oil, bitumen and natural gas.  Our operations are subject to extensive governmental regulations. From time to time, regulatory agencies have imposed price controls and limitations on production by restricting the rate of flow of crude oil, bitumen and natural gas wells below actual production capacity in order to conserve supplies of crude oil and natural gas. Because legal requirements are frequently changed and subject to interpretation, we cannot predict the effect of these requirements.  Our investments in joint ventures decrease our ability to manage risk.  We conduct many of our operations through joint ventures in which we may share control with our joint venture participants. There is a risk our joint venture participants may at any time have economic, business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with those of the joint venture or us, or our joint venture participants may be unable to meet their economic or other obligations and we may be required to fulfill those obligations alone. Failure by us, or an entity in which we have a joint venture interest, to adequately manage the risks associated with any acquisitions or joint ventures could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of our joint ventures and, in turn, our business and operations.  25    Table of Contents  We do not insure against all potential losses; and therefore, we could be harmed by unexpected liabilities and increased costs.  We maintain insurance against many, but not all, potential losses or liabilities arising from operating risks. As such, our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to fully cover us against potential losses arising from such risks. Uninsured losses and liabilities arising from operating risks could reduce the funds available to us for capital, exploration and investment spending and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  Our operations present hazards and risks that require significant and continuous oversight.  The scope and nature of our operations present a variety of operational hazards and risks that must be managed through continual oversight and control. These risks are present throughout the process of exploration, production, transportation, refinement and storage of the hydrocarbons we produce. Failure to manage these risks could result in injury or loss of life, environmental damage, loss of revenues and damage to our reputation.     Item 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS
