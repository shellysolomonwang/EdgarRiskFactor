Item 1A.  Risk Factors.    ExxonMobil’s financial and operating results are subject to a variety of risks inherent in the global oil and gas business. Many of these risk factors are not within the Company’s control and could adversely affect our business, our financial and operating results or our financial condition. These factors include the following:    Industry and Economic Factors: The oil and gas business is fundamentally a commodity business. This means the operations and earnings of the Corporation and its affiliates throughout the world may be significantly affected by changes in oil, gas and petrochemical prices and by changes in margins on gasoline and other refined products. Oil, gas, petrochemical and product prices and margins in turn depend on local, regional and global events or conditions that affect supply and demand for the relevant commodity. These events or conditions are generally not predictable and include, among other things:        •    general economic growth rates and the occurrence of economic recessions;        •    the development of new supply sources;        •    adherence by countries to OPEC quotas;        •    supply disruptions;        •    weather, including seasonal patterns that affect regional energy demand (such as the demand for heating oil or gas in winter) as well as severe weather events (such as hurricanes) that can disrupt supplies or interrupt the operation of ExxonMobil facilities;        •    technological advances, including advances in exploration, production, refining and petrochemical manufacturing technology and advances in technology relating to energy usage;        •    changes in demographics, including population growth rates and consumer preferences; and        •    the competitiveness of alternative hydrocarbon or other energy sources.    Under certain market conditions, factors that have a positive impact on one segment of our business may have a negative impact on another segment and vice versa.    Competitive Factors: The energy and petrochemical industries are highly competitive. There is competition within the industries and also with other industries in supplying the energy, fuel and chemical needs of both industrial and individual consumers. The Corporation competes with other firms in the sale or purchase of needed goods and services in many national and international markets and employs all methods of competition which are lawful and appropriate for such purposes.    A key component of the Corporation’s competitive position, particularly given the commodity-based nature of many of its businesses, is ExxonMobil’s ability to manage expenses successfully. This requires continuous management focus on reducing unit costs and improving efficiency including through technology improvements, cost control, productivity enhancements and regular reappraisal of our asset portfolio.    2    Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Political and Legal Factors: The operations and earnings of the Corporation and its affiliates throughout the world have been, and may in the future be, affected from time to time in varying degree by political and legal factors including:        •    political instability or lack of well-established and reliable legal systems in areas where the Corporation operates;        •    other political developments and laws and regulations, such as expropriation or forced divestiture of assets, unilateral cancellation or modification of contract terms, and regulation of certain energy markets;        •    laws and regulations related to environmental or energy security matters, including those addressing alternative energy sources and the risks of global climate change;        •    restrictions on exploration, production, imports and exports;        •    restrictions on the Corporation’s ability to do business with certain countries, or to engage in certain areas of business within a country;        •    price controls;        •    tax or royalty increases, including retroactive claims;        •    war or other international conflicts; and        •    civil unrest.    Both the likelihood of these occurrences and their overall effect upon the Corporation vary greatly from country to country and are not predictable.    Project Factors: In addition to some of the factors cited above, ExxonMobil’s results depend upon the Corporation’s ability to develop and operate major projects and facilities as planned. The Corporation’s results will therefore be affected by events or conditions that impact the advancement, operation, cost or results of such projects or facilities, including:        •    the outcome of negotiations with co-venturers, governments, suppliers, customers or others (including, for example, our ability to negotiate favorable long-term contracts with customers, or the development of reliable spot markets, that may be necessary to support the development of particular production projects);        •    reservoir performance and natural field decline;        •    changes in operating conditions and costs, including costs of third party equipment or services such as drilling rigs and shipping;        •    security concerns or acts of terrorism that threaten or disrupt the safe operation of company facilities; and        •    the occurrence of unforeseen technical difficulties (including technical problems that may delay start-up or interrupt production from an Upstream project or that may lead to unexpected downtime of refineries or petrochemical plants).    The Corporation’s overall volume capacity outlook, based on projects coming on stream as anticipated, is for production capacity to grow over the period 2009-2013. However, actual volumes will vary from year to year due to the timing of individual project start-ups, operational outages, reservoir performance, regulatory changes, asset sales, weather events, price effects on production sharing contracts and other factors described above.    3    Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The estimation of proved reserves, which is based on the requirement of reasonable certainty, is an ongoing process based on rigorous technical evaluations, commercial and market assessments and detailed analysis of well information such as flow rates and reservoir pressure declines. Furthermore, the Corporation only records proved reserves for projects which have received significant funding commitments by management made toward the development of the reserves. Although the Corporation is reasonably certain that proved reserves will be produced, the timing and amount recovered can be affected by a number of factors including completion of development projects, reservoir performance, regulatory approvals and significant changes in projections of long-term oil and gas price levels.    Market Risk Factors:                  Worldwide Average Realizations—Consolidated Subsidiaries   2008   2007   2006   Crude oil and NGL ($/barrel)   $ 89.32   $ 66.02   $ 58.34   Natural gas ($/kcf)     7.54     5.29     6.08    Crude oil, natural gas, petroleum product and chemical prices have fluctuated in response to changing market forces. The impacts of these price fluctuations on earnings from Upstream, Downstream and Chemical operations have varied. In the Upstream a $1 per barrel change in the weighted-average realized price of oil would have approximately a $375 million annual after-tax effect on Upstream consolidated plus equity company earnings. Similarly, a $0.10 per kcf change in the worldwide average gas realization would have approximately a $175 million annual after-tax effect on Upstream consolidated plus equity company earnings. For any given period, the extent of actual benefit or detriment will be dependent on the price movements of individual types of crude oil, taxes and other government take impacts, price adjustment lags in long-term gas contracts, and crude and gas production volumes. Accordingly, changes in benchmark prices for crude oil and natural gas only provide broad indicators of changes in the earnings experienced in any particular period.    In the very competitive downstream and chemical environments, earnings are primarily determined by margin capture rather than absolute price levels of products sold. Refining margins are a function of the difference between what a refiner pays for its raw materials (primarily crude oil) and the market prices for the range of products produced. These prices in turn depend on global and regional supply/demand balances, inventory levels, refinery operations, import/export balances and weather.    The global energy markets can give rise to extended periods in which market conditions are adverse to one or more of the Corporation’s businesses. Such conditions, along with the capital-intensive nature of the industry and very long lead times associated with many of our projects, underscore the importance of maintaining a strong financial position. Management views the Corporation’s financial strength, including the AAA and Aaa ratings of its long-term debt securities by Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s, as a competitive advantage.    In general, segment results are not dependent on the ability to sell and/or purchase products to/from other segments. Instead, where such sales take place, they are the result of efficiencies and competitive advantages of integrated refinery/chemical complexes. Additionally, intersegment sales are at market-based prices. The products bought and sold between segments can also be acquired in worldwide markets that have substantial liquidity, capacity and transportation capabilities. About 40 percent of the Corporation’s intersegment sales are crude oil produced by the Upstream and sold to the Downstream. Other intersegment sales include those between refineries and chemical plants related to raw materials, feedstocks and finished products.    4    Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Although price levels of crude oil and natural gas may rise or fall significantly over the short to medium term due to political events, OPEC actions and other factors, industry economics over the long term will continue to be driven by market supply and demand. Accordingly, the Corporation tests the viability of all of its investments over a broad range of future prices. The Corporation’s assessment is that its operations will continue to be successful in a variety of market conditions. This is the outcome of disciplined investment and asset management programs. Investment opportunities are tested against a variety of market conditions, including low-price scenarios.    The Corporation has an active asset management program in which underperforming assets are either improved to acceptable levels or considered for divestment. The asset management program includes a disciplined, regular review to ensure that all assets are contributing to the Corporation’s strategic objectives. The result is an efficient capital base, and the Corporation has seldom had to write down the carrying value of assets, even during periods of low commodity prices.    Risk Management    The Corporation’s size, strong capital structure, geographic diversity and the complementary nature of the Upstream, Downstream and Chemical businesses reduce the Corporation’s enterprise-wide risk from changes in interest rates, currency rates and commodity prices. As a result, the Corporation makes limited use of derivative instruments to mitigate the impact of such changes. The Corporation does not engage in speculative derivative activities or derivative trading activities nor does it use derivatives with leveraged features. The Corporation maintains a system of controls that includes the authorization, reporting and monitoring of derivative activity. The Corporation’s limited derivative activities pose no material credit or market risks to ExxonMobil’s operations, financial condition or liquidity. “Note 12: Financial Instruments and Derivatives” of the Financial Section of this report summarizes the fair value of derivatives outstanding at year end and the gains or losses that have been recognized in net income.    The Corporation is exposed to changes in interest rates, primarily on its short-term debt and the portion of long-term debt that carries floating interest rates. The impact of a 100-basis-point change in interest rates affecting the Corporation’s debt would not be material to earnings, cash flow or fair value. The Corporation’s cash balances exceeded total debt at year-end 2008 and 2007. During 2008, credit markets tightened and the global economy slowed. The Corporation is not dependent on the credit markets to fund current operations. However, some joint-venture partners are dependent on the credit markets and their funding ability may impact the development pace of joint-venture projects.    The Corporation conducts business in many foreign currencies and is subject to exchange rate risk on cash flows related to sales, expenses, financing and investment transactions. The impacts of fluctuations in exchange rates on ExxonMobil’s geographically and functionally diverse operations are varied and often offsetting in amount. The Corporation makes limited use of currency exchange contracts, commodity forwards, swaps and futures contracts to mitigate the impact of changes in currency values and commodity prices. Exposures related to the Corporation’s limited use of the above contracts are not material.    Inflation and Other Uncertainties    The general rate of inflation in many major countries of operation increased in 2008 versus the relatively low rates in recent years, and the associated impact on non-energy costs has generally been mitigated by cost reductions from efficiency and productivity improvements. Increased global     5    Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements  demand for certain services and materials has resulted in higher operating and capital costs in recent years. The Corporation works to counter upward pressure on costs through its economies of scale in global procurement and its efficient project management practices.    Projections, estimates and descriptions of ExxonMobil’s plans and objectives included or incorporated in Items 1, 2, 7 and 7A of this report are forward-looking statements. Actual future results, including project completion dates, production rates, capital expenditures, costs and business plans could differ materially due to, among other things, the factors discussed above and elsewhere in this report.
