Item 1A.   Risk Factors    FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS/ RISK FACTORS AND CAUTIONARY STATEMENT   FOR PURPOSES OF THE “SAFE HARBOR” PROVISIONS OF   THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995   Certain matters contained in this report, excluding historical information, include forward-looking statements — statements that discuss our expected future results based on current and pending business operations. We make these forward-looking statements in reliance on the safe harbor protections provided under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.   All statements, other than statements of historical facts, included in this report which address activities, events or developments that we expect, believe or anticipate will exist or may occur in the future, are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements can be identified by various forms of words such as “anticipates,” “believes,” “could,” “may,” “should,” “continues,” “estimates,” “expects,” “forecasts,” “might,” “planned,” “potential,” “projects,” “scheduled” or similar expressions. These forward-looking statements include, among others, statements regarding:            •   amounts and nature of future capital expenditures;         •   expansion and growth of our business and operations;         •   business strategy;         •   estimates of proved gas and oil reserves;         •   reserve potential;         •   development drilling potential;         •   cash flow from operations;         •   seasonality of certain business segments;         •   power and gas prices and demand.    Forward-looking statements are based on numerous assumptions, uncertainties and risks that could cause future events or results to be materially different from those stated or implied in this document.   Some of these risks are described in the “Risk Factors” section of this report and one should keep in mind these risk factors when considering forward-looking statements. Given the uncertainties and risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement, we caution investors not to unduly rely on our forward-looking statements. We disclaim any obligation to update the above list or to announce publicly the result of any revisions to any of the forward-looking statements to reflect future events or developments. Further, the information about our intentions contained or incorporated into this report represents our intention as of the date of this report and is based on, among other things, the existing regulatory environment, industry conditions, market conditions and prices, the economy in general and our assumptions as of such date. We may change our intentions, at any time and without notice, based upon any changes in such factors, in our assumptions, or otherwise.  21   Table of Contents      RISK FACTORS   You should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information in this Report. Each of these factors could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in our securities.   Risks Inherent to our Industry and Business   The long-term financial condition of our natural gas transmission and midstream businesses is dependent on the continued availability of natural gas supplies in the supply basins that we access, demand for those supplies in our traditional markets, and market demand for natural gas.   The development of additional natural gas reserves requires significant capital expenditures by others for exploration and development drilling and the installation of production, gathering, storage, transportation and other facilities that permit natural gas to be produced and delivered to our pipeline systems. Low prices for natural gas, regulatory limitations, or the lack of available capital for these projects could adversely affect the development of additional reserves and production, gathering, storage and pipeline transmission and import and export of natural gas supplies. Additional natural gas reserves might not be developed in commercial quantities and in sufficient amounts to fill the capacities of our gathering, transmission and processing pipeline facilities. Additionally, in some cases, new LNG import facilities built near our markets could result in less demand for our gathering and transmission facilities.   Estimating reserves and future net revenues involves uncertainties and negative revisions to reserve estimates, and oil and gas price declines may lead to impairment of oil and gas assets.   Reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner. Reserves that are “proved reserves” are those estimated quantities of crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids which geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty are recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions, but should not be considered as a guarantee of results for future drilling projects.   The process relies on interpretations of available geological, geophysical, engineering and production data. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing of developmental expenditures, including many factors beyond the control of the producer. The reserve data included in this Report represent estimates. In addition, the estimates of future net revenues from our proved reserves and the present value of such estimates are based upon certain assumptions about future production levels, prices and costs that may not prove to be correct over time.   Quantities of proved reserves are estimated based on economic conditions in existence during the period of assessment. Lower oil and gas prices may have the impact of shortening the economic lives of certain fields because it becomes uneconomic to produce all recoverable reserves on such fields, which reduces proved property reserve estimates.   If negative revisions in the estimated quantities of proved reserves were to occur, it would have the effect of increasing the rates of depreciation, depletion and amortization on the affected properties, which would decrease earnings or result in losses through higher depreciation, depletion and amortization expense. The revisions may also be sufficient to trigger impairment losses on certain properties which would result in a further non-cash charge to earnings. The revisions could also possibly affect the evaluation of Exploration & Production’s goodwill for impairment purposes.  22   Table of Contents  Historic performance of our exploration and production business is no guarantee of future performance.   Our success rate for drilling projects in 2005 should not be considered a predictor of future performance.   Performance of our exploration and production business is affected in part by factors beyond our control, such as:            •   regulations and regulatory approvals;         •   availability of capital for drilling projects which may be affected by other risk factors discussed in this report;         •   cost-effective availability of drilling rigs and necessary equipment;         •   availability of cost-effective transportation for products;         •   market risks discussed in this report.    Our drilling, production, gathering, processing and transporting activities involve numerous risks that might result in accidents and other operating risks and costs.   Our operations are subject to all the risks and hazards typically associated with the development and exploration for, and the production and transportation of oil and gas. These operating risks include, but are not limited to:            •   blowouts, cratering and explosions;         •   uncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas or well fluids;         •   fires;         •   formations with abnormal pressures;         •   pollution and other environmental risks;         •   natural disasters.    In addition, there are inherent in our gas gathering, processing and transporting properties a variety of hazards and operating risks, such as leaks, explosions and mechanical problems that could cause substantial financial losses. In addition, these risks could result in loss of human life, significant damage to property, environmental pollution, impairment of our operations and substantial losses to us. In accordance with customary industry practice, we maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these risks and losses. The location of pipelines near populated areas, including residential areas, commercial business centers and industrial sites, could increase the level of damages resulting from these risks. Certain segments of our pipelines run through such areas. In spite of our precautions, an event could cause considerable harm to people or property, and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations, particularly if the event is not fully covered by insurance. Accidents or other operating risks could further result in loss of service available to our customers. Such circumstances could adversely impact our ability to meet contractual obligations and retain customers.   Costs of environmental liabilities and complying with existing and future environmental regulations could exceed our current expectations.   Our operations are subject to extensive environmental regulation pursuant to a variety of federal, provincial, state and municipal laws and regulations. Such laws and regulations impose, among other things, restrictions, liabilities and obligations in connection with the generation, handling, use, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, in connection with spills, releases and emissions of various substances into the environment, and in connection with the operation, maintenance, abandonment and reclamation of our facilities.  23   Table of Contents  Compliance with environmental laws will require significant expenditures, including for clean up costs and damages arising out of contaminated properties. The possible failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations that might result in the imposition of fines and penalties. We are generally responsible for all liabilities associated with the environmental condition of our facilities and assets, whether acquired or developed, regardless of when the liabilities arose and whether they are known or unknown. In connection with certain acquisitions and divestitures, we could acquire, or be required to provide indemnification against, environmental liabilities that could expose us to material losses, which may not be covered by insurance. In addition, the steps we could be required to take to bring certain facilities into compliance could be prohibitively expensive, and we might be required to shut down, divest or alter the operation of those facilities, which might cause us to incur losses. Although we do not expect that the costs of complying with current environmental laws will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations, no assurance can be given that the costs of complying with environmental laws in the future will not have such an effect.   We make assumptions and develop expectations about possible expenditures related to environmental conditions based on current laws and regulations and current interpretations of those laws and regulations. If the interpretation of laws or regulations, or the laws and regulations themselves, change, our assumptions may change. Our regulatory rate structure and our contracts with customers might not necessarily allow us to recover capital costs we incur to comply with the new environmental regulations. Also, we might not be able to obtain or maintain from time to time all required environmental regulatory approvals for certain development projects. If there is a delay in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approvals or if we fail to obtain and comply with them, the operation of our facilities could be prevented or become subject to additional costs, resulting in potentially material adverse consequences to our operations.   Our operating results for certain segments of our business might fluctuate on a seasonal and quarterly basis.   Revenues from certain segments of our business, including gas transmission and the sale of electric power, can have seasonal characteristics. In many parts of the country, demand for power peaks during the hot summer months, with market prices also peaking at that time. In other areas, demand for power peaks during the winter. In addition, demand for gas and other fuels peaks during the winter. As a result, our overall operating results in the future might fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis. Demand for gas and other fuels could vary significantly from our expectations depending on the nature and location of our facilities and pipeline systems and the terms of our power sale agreements and gas transmission arrangements relative to demand created by unusual weather patterns. Additionally, changes in the price of natural gas could benefit one of our business units, but disadvantage another. For example, our Exploration & Production business may benefit from higher natural gas prices, and Power, which uses gas as a fuel source, may not.   Risks Related to the Current Geopolitical Situation   Our investments and projects located outside of the United States expose us to risks related to laws of other countries, taxes, economic conditions, fluctuations in currency rates, political conditions and policies of foreign governments. These risks might delay or reduce our realization of value from our international projects.   We currently own and might acquire and/or dispose of material energy-related investments and projects outside the United States. The economic and political conditions in certain countries where we have interests or in which we might explore development, acquisition or investment opportunities present risks of delays in construction and interruption of business, as well as risks of war, expropriation, nationalization, renegotiation, trade sanctions or nullification of existing contracts and changes in law or tax policy, that are greater than in the United States. The uncertainty of the legal environment in certain foreign countries in which we develop or acquire projects or make investments could make it more difficult to obtain non-recourse project or other financing on suitable terms, could adversely affect the ability of certain customers to honor their obligations with respect to such projects or investments and could impair our ability to enforce our rights under agreements relating to such projects or investments.  24   Table of Contents  Operations in foreign countries also can present currency exchange rate and convertibility, inflation and repatriation risk. In certain conditions under which we develop or acquire projects, or make investments, economic and monetary conditions and other factors could affect our ability to convert our earnings denominated in foreign currencies. In addition, risk from fluctuations in currency exchange rates can arise when our foreign subsidiaries expend or borrow funds in one type of currency but receive revenue in another. In such cases, an adverse change in exchange rates can reduce our ability to meet expenses, including debt service obligations. Foreign currency risk can also arise when the revenues received by our foreign subsidiaries are not in U.S. dollars. In such cases, a strengthening of the U.S. dollar could reduce the amount of cash and income we receive from these foreign subsidiaries. We have put contracts in place to mitigate our most significant foreign currency exchange risks. We have some exposures that are not hedged which could result in losses or volatility in our earnings.   Risks Related to Strategy and Financing   Our debt agreements impose restrictions on us that may adversely affect our ability to operate our business.   Certain of our debt agreements contain covenants that restrict or limit among other things, our ability to create liens, sell assets, make certain distributions, repurchase equity and incur additional debt. In addition, our debt agreements contain, and those we enter into in the future may contain, financial covenants and other limitations with which we will need to comply. Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by many events beyond our control, and we cannot assure you that our future operating results will be sufficient to comply with the covenants or, in the event of a default under any of our debt agreements, to remedy that default.   Our failure to comply with the covenants in our debt agreements and other related transactional documents could result in events of default. Upon the occurrence of such an event of default, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under a particular facility to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments, if any, to extend further credit. An event of default or an acceleration under one debt agreement could cause a cross-default or cross-acceleration of another debt agreement. Such a default or acceleration could have a wider impact on our liquidity than might otherwise arise from a default or acceleration of a single debt instrument. If an event of default occurs, or if other debt agreements cross-default, and the lenders under the affected debt agreements accelerate the maturity of any loans or other debt outstanding to us, we may not have sufficient liquidity to repay amounts outstanding under such debt agreements.   Developments affecting the wholesale power and energy trading industry sector have reduced market activity and liquidity and might continue to adversely affect our results of operations.   In 2004, we announced our decision to maintain our wholesale power and energy trading business and trading portfolio. Therefore, the legacy issues arising out of the 2000-2001 energy crisis in California, the resulting collapse in energy merchant credit and volatility in natural gas prices, the Enron Corporation bankruptcy filing, and investigations by governmental authorities into energy trading activities and increased litigation related to such inquiries, could continue to affect us in the future. These market factors have led to industry-wide downturns that have resulted in some companies being forced to exit the energy trading markets leading to a reduction in the number of trading partners and market liquidity.   Our lack of investment grade credit ratings increases our costs of doing business in many ways and increases our risks from market disruptions and further credit downgrades.   Because we do not have an investment grade credit rating, our transactions in each of our businesses require greater credit assurances, both to be given from, and received by, us to satisfy credit support requirements. In addition, we are more vulnerable to the impact of market disruptions or a further downgrade  25   Table of Contents  of our credit rating that might further increase our cost of borrowing or further impair our ability to access one or any of the capital markets. Such disruptions could include:            •   further economic downturns;         •   deteriorating capital market conditions generally;         •   declining market prices for electricity and natural gas;         •   terrorist attacks or threatened attacks on our facilities or those of other energy companies;         •   the overall health of the energy industry, including the bankruptcy or insolvency of other companies.    Despite our restructuring efforts, we may not attain investment grade ratings.   Credit rating agencies perform independent analysis when assigning credit ratings. Given the significant changes in capital markets and the energy industry over the last few years, credit rating agencies continue to review the criteria for attaining investment grade ratings and make changes to those criteria from time to time. Our goal is to attain investment grade ratios. However, there is no guarantee that the credit rating agencies will assign us investment grade ratings even if we meet or exceed their criteria for investment grade ratios.   Electricity, natural gas liquids and gas prices are volatile and this volatility could adversely affect our financial results, cash flows, access to capital and ability to maintain existing businesses.   Our revenues, operating results, profitability, future rate of growth and the value of our power and gas businesses depend primarily upon the prices we receive for natural gas, electricity and other commodities. Prices also affect the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures and our ability to borrow money or raise additional capital.   Historically, the markets for these commodities have been volatile and they are likely to continue to be volatile. Wide fluctuations in prices might result from relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for these commodities, market uncertainty and other factors that are beyond our control, including:            •   worldwide and domestic supplies of and demand for electricity, natural gas, petroleum, and related commodities;         •   turmoil in the Middle East and other producing regions;         •   terrorist attacks on production or transportation assets;         •   weather conditions;         •   the level of consumer demand;         •   the price and availability of other types of fuels;         •   the availability of pipeline capacity;         •   the price and level of foreign imports;         •   domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes;         •   volatility in the natural gas markets;         •   the overall economic environment;         •   the credit of participants in the markets where products are bought and sold.    We might not be able to successfully manage the risks associated with selling and marketing products in the wholesale energy markets.   Our portfolios consist of wholesale contracts to buy and sell commodities, including contracts for electricity, natural gas, natural gas liquids and other commodities that are settled by the delivery of the  26   Table of Contents  commodity or cash throughout the United States. If the values of these contracts change in a direction or manner that we do not anticipate or cannot manage, we could realize material losses from our marketing. In the past, certain marketing and trading companies have experienced severe financial problems due to price volatility in the energy commodity markets. In certain instances this volatility has caused companies to be unable to deliver energy commodities that they had guaranteed under contract. In such event, we might incur additional losses to the extent of amounts, if any, already paid to, or received from, counterparties. In addition, in our businesses, we often extend credit to our counterparties. Despite performing credit analysis prior to extending credit, we are exposed to the risk that we might not be able to collect amounts owed to us. If the counterparty to such a financing transaction fails to perform and any collateral that secures our counterparty’s obligation is inadequate, we will lose money.   If we are unable to perform under our energy agreements, we could be required to pay damages. These damages generally would be based on the difference between the market price to acquire replacement energy or energy services and the relevant contract price. Depending on price volatility in the wholesale energy markets, such damages could be significant.   Risks Related to Regulations that Affect our Industry   Our gas sales, transmission, and storage operations are subject to government regulations and rate proceedings that could have an adverse impact on the profitability of these operations.   Our interstate gas sales, transmission, and storage operations conducted through our Gas Pipelines business are subject to the FERC’s rules and regulations in accordance with the Natural Gas Act of 1938 and the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978. The FERC’s regulatory authority extends to:            •   transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce;         •   rates and charges;         •   construction;         •   acquisition, extension or abandonment of services or facilities;         •   accounts and records;         •   depreciation and amortization policies;         •   operating terms and conditions of service.    Regulatory actions in these areas can affect our business in many ways, including decreasing tariff rates and revenues, decreasing volumes in our pipelines, increasing our costs and otherwise altering the profitability of our business.   The FERC has taken certain actions to strengthen market forces in the natural gas pipeline industry that have led to increased competition throughout the industry. In a number of key markets, interstate pipelines are now facing competitive pressure from other major pipeline systems, enabling local distribution companies and end users to choose a transmission provider based on considerations other than location.   Our revenues might decrease if we are unable to gain adequate, reliable and affordable access to transmission and distribution assets due to the FERC and regional regulation of wholesale market transactions for electricity and gas.   We depend on transmission and distribution facilities owned and operated by utilities and other energy companies to deliver the electricity and natural gas we buy and sell in the wholesale market. If transmission is disrupted, if capacity is inadequate, or if credit requirements or rates of such utilities or energy companies are increased, our ability to sell and deliver products might be hindered. The FERC has issued power transmission regulations that require wholesale electric transmission services to be offered on an open-access, non-discriminatory basis. Although these regulations are designed to encourage competition in wholesale market transactions for electricity, we believe that some companies may have failed to provide fair and equal access to  27   Table of Contents  their transmission systems or have not provided sufficient transmission capacity to enable other companies to transmit electric power. We cannot predict whether and to what extent the industry will comply with these initiatives, or whether the regulations will fully accomplish the FERC’s objectives.   In addition, the independent system operators who oversee the transmission systems in regional power markets, such as California, have in the past been authorized to impose, and might continue to impose, price limitations and other mechanisms to address volatility in the power markets. These types of price limitations and other mechanisms might adversely impact the profitability of our wholesale power marketing and trading. Given the extreme volatility and lack of meaningful long-term price history in many of these markets and the imposition of price limitations by regulators, independent system operators or other marker operators, we can offer no assurance that we will be able to operate profitably in all wholesale power markets.   The different regional power markets in which we compete or will compete in the future have changing regulatory structures, which could affect our growth and performance in these regions.   Our results are likely to be affected by differences in the market and transmission regulatory structures in various regional power markets. Problems or delays that might arise in the formation and operation of new regional transmission organizations (RTOs) might restrict our ability to sell power produced by our generating capacity to certain markets if there is insufficient transmission capacity otherwise available. The rules governing the various regional power markets might also change from time to time which could affect our costs or revenues. Because it remains unclear which companies will be participating in the various regional power markets, or how RTOs will develop and evolve or what regions they will cover, we are unable to assess fully the impact that these power markets might have on our business.   Our businesses are subject to complex government regulations. The operation of our businesses might be adversely affected by changes in these regulations or in their interpretation or implementation.   Existing regulations might be revised or reinterpreted, new laws and regulations might be adopted or become applicable to us or our facilities, and future changes in laws and regulations might have a detrimental effect on our business. Over the past few years, certain restructured energy markets have experienced supply problems and price volatility. In some of these markets, including California, proposals have been made by governmental agencies and other interested parties to re-regulate areas of these markets which have previously been deregulated. Various forms of market controls and limitations including price caps and bid caps have already been implemented and new controls and market restructuring proposals are in various stages of development, consideration and implementation. We cannot assure you that changes in market structure and regulation will not adversely affect our business. We cannot assure you that other proposals to re-regulate will not be made or that legislative or other attention to the electric power restructuring process will not cause the deregulation process to be delayed or reversed.   The outcome of pending rate cases to set the rates we can charge customers on certain of our pipelines might result in rates that do not provide an adequate return on the capital we have invested in those pipelines.   We anticipate that in the next twelve months we will file rate cases with the FERC to request changes to the rates we charge on Northwest Pipeline and Transco. The outcome of those rate cases is uncertain. There is a risk that rates set by the FERC will be lower than is necessary to provide us with an adequate return on the capital we have invested in these assets. There is also the risk that higher rates will cause our customers to look for alternative ways to transport their natural gas.   Legal and regulatory proceedings and investigations relating to the energy industry and capital markets have adversely affected our business and many continue to do so.   Public and regulatory scrutiny of the energy industry and of the capital markets has resulted in increased regulation being either proposed or implemented. Such scrutiny has also resulted in various inquiries, investigations and court proceedings in which we are a named defendant.  28   Table of Contents  Such inquiries, investigations and court proceedings are ongoing and continue to adversely affect our business as a whole. We might see these adverse effects continue as a result of the uncertainty of these ongoing inquiries and proceedings, or additional inquiries and proceedings by federal or state regulatory agencies or private plaintiffs. In addition, we cannot predict the outcome of any of these inquiries or whether these inquiries will lead to additional legal proceedings against us, civil or criminal fines or penalties, or other regulatory action, including legislation, which might be materially adverse to the operation of our business and our revenues and net income or increase our operating costs in other ways. Current legal proceedings or other matters against us arising out of our ongoing and discontinued operations including environmental matters, disputes over gas measurement, royalty payments, shareholder class action suits, regulatory appeals and similar matters might result in adverse decisions against us. The result of such adverse decisions, either individually or in the aggregate, could be material and may not be covered fully or at all by insurance.   Risks Related to Accounting Standards   Potential changes in accounting standards might cause us to revise our financial results and disclosure in the future, which might change the way analysts measure our business or financial performance.   Accounting irregularities discovered in the past few years in various industries have forced regulators and legislators to take a renewed look at accounting practices, financial disclosures, companies’ relationships with their independent auditors and retirement plan practices. Because it is still unclear what laws or regulations will ultimately develop, we cannot predict the ultimate impact of any future changes in accounting regulations or practices in general with respect to public companies or the energy industry or in our operations specifically.   In addition, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) or the SEC could enact new accounting standards that might impact how we are required to record revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities.   Risks Related to Market Volatility and Risk Management   Our reported results are subject to volatility around our use of derivatives that hedge the economic risk of our commodity exposures. Some derivatives do not qualify as hedges under SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” (SFAS 133) and so changes in fair value are recorded to income. During the period from 2002 to 2004 when our Power business was for sale, most changes in the fair value of derivatives used in our Power business were recorded to income as net forward unrealized mark-to-market gains. In future periods, the cash associated with those hedges could be realized but the value will have already been recorded in income.   Our risk measurement and hedging activities might not prevent losses.   We manage our commodity price risk for our unregulated businesses as a whole. Although we have risk measurement systems in place that use various methodologies to quantify risk, these systems might not always be followed or might not always work as planned. Further, such risk measurement systems do not in themselves manage risk, and adverse changes in energy commodity market prices, volatility, adverse correlation of commodity prices, the liquidity of markets, and changes in interest rates might still adversely affect our earnings and cash flows and our balance sheet under applicable accounting rules, even if risks have been identified.   In an effort to manage our financial exposure related to commodity price and market fluctuations, we have entered into contracts to hedge certain risks associated with our assets and operations, including our long-term tolling agreements. In these hedging activities, we have used fixed-price, forward, physical purchase and sales contracts, futures, financial swaps and option contracts traded in the over-the-counter markets or on exchanges, as well as long-term structured transactions when feasible. Nevertheless, no single hedging arrangement can adequately address all risks present in a given contract. For example, a forward contract that would be effective in hedging commodity price volatility risks would not hedge the tolling contract’s counterparty credit or performance risk. Therefore, unhedged risks will always continue to exist. While we attempt to manage counterparty credit risk within guidelines established by our credit policy, we may not be  29   Table of Contents  able to successfully manage all credit risk and as such, future cash flows could be impacted by counterparty default.   The impact of changes in market prices for natural gas on the average gas prices received by us may be reduced based on the level of our hedging strategies. These hedging arrangements may limit our potential gains if the market prices for natural gas were to rise substantially over the price established by the hedge. In addition, our hedging arrangements expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including instances in which:            •   production is less than expected;         •   a change in the difference between published price indexes established by pipelines in which our hedged production is delivered and the reference price established in the hedging arrangements is such that we are required to make payments to our counterparties;         •   the counterparties to our hedging arrangements fail to honor their financial commitments.    Risks Related to Employees, Outsourcing of Non-Core Support Activities   Institutional knowledge residing with current employees or our former employees now employed by our outsourcing service providers might not be adequately preserved.   In certain segments of our business, institutional knowledge resides with employees who have many years of service. As these employees reach retirement age, we may not be able to replace them with employees of comparable knowledge and experience. Other qualified individuals could leave us or refuse our offers of employment if our recruiting and retention efforts are unsuccessful. Our efforts at knowledge transfer could be inadequate.   Due to the large number of our former employees who were migrated to an outsourcing provider in 2004, access to significant amounts of internal historical knowledge and expertise could become unavailable to us, particularly if knowledge transfer initiatives are delayed or ineffective.   Failure of the outsourcing relationships might negatively impact our ability to conduct our business.   Some studies indicate a high failure rate of outsourcing relationships. Although we have taken steps to build a cooperative and mutually beneficial relationship with our outsourcing providers, a failure of all or part of these relationships could lead to loss of institutional knowledge and interruption of services necessary for us to be able to conduct our business.   Our ability to receive services from outsourcing provider locations outside of the United States might be impacted by cultural differences, political instability, or unanticipated regulatory requirements in jurisdictions outside the United States.   Certain accounting, information technology application development, human resources, and helpdesk services that are currently provided by our outsourcing provider were relocated to service centers outside of the United States during 2005. The economic and political conditions in certain countries from which our outsourcing providers may provide services to us present similar risks of business operations located outside of the United States previously discussed, including risks of interruption of business, war, expropriation, nationalization, renegotiation, trade sanctions or nullification of existing contracts and changes in law or tax policy, that are greater than in the United States.   Risks Related to Weather, other Natural Phenomena and Business Disruption   Our assets and operations can be affected by weather and other natural phenomena.   Our assets and operations, especially those located offshore, can be adversely affected by hurricanes, earthquakes, tornadoes and other natural phenomena and weather conditions including extreme temperatures, making it more difficult for us to realize the historic rates of return associated with these assets and operations.  30   Table of Contents  Our current information technology infrastructure is aging and may adversely affect our ability to conduct our business.   Limited capital spending for information technology infrastructure during 2001-2003 resulted in an aging server environment that may not be adequate for our current business needs. While efforts are ongoing to update the environment, the current age and condition of equipment could result in loss of internal and external communications, loss of data, inability to access data when needed, excessive software downtime (including downtime for critical software applications), and other disruptions that could have a material adverse impact on our business.
