Item 1A. Risk Factors   FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AND CAUTIONARY STATEMENT  FOR PURPOSES OF THE “SAFE HARBOR” PROVISIONS OF  THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995  Certain matters contained in this report include “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These forward-looking statements relate to anticipated financial performance, management’s plans and objectives for future operations, business prospects, outcome of regulatory proceedings, market conditions and other matters. We make these forward-looking statements in reliance on the safe harbor protections provided under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  All statements, other than statements of historical facts, included in this report that address activities, events or developments that we expect, believe or anticipate will exist or may occur in the future, are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements can be identified by various forms of words such as “anticipates,” “believes,” “seeks,” “could,” “may,” “should,” “continues,” “estimates,” “expects,” “forecasts,” “intends,” “might,” “goals,” “objectives,” “targets,” “planned,” “potential,” “projects,” “scheduled,” “will,” “assumes,” “guidance,” “outlook,”“in service date,” or other similar expressions. These forward-looking statements are based on management’s beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to management and include, among others, statements regarding:        •    Amounts and nature of future capital expenditures;        •    Expansion and growth of our business and operations;        •    Financial condition and liquidity;        •    Business strategy;        •    Cash flow from operations or results of operations;        •    The levels of dividends to stockholders;        •    Seasonality of certain business components; and        •    Natural gas, natural gas liquids and olefins prices and demand.  Forward-looking statements are based on numerous assumptions, uncertainties and risks that could cause future events or results to be materially different from those stated or implied in this report. Many of the factors that will determine these results are beyond our ability to control or predict. Specific factors that could cause actual results to differ from results contemplated by the forward-looking statements include, among others, the following:        •    Whether we have sufficient cash to enable us to pay current and expected levels of dividends;        •    Availability of supplies, market demand, volatility of prices, and the availability and cost of capital;        •    Inflation, interest rates, fluctuation in foreign exchange, and general economic conditions (including future disruptions and volatility in the global credit markets and the impact of these events on our customers and suppliers);        •    The strength and financial resources of our competitors;        •    Ability to acquire new businesses and assets and integrate those operations and assets into our existing businesses, as well as expand our facilities;        •    Development of alternative energy sources;        •    The impact of operational and development hazards;    25    Table of Contents     •    Costs of, changes in, or the results of laws, government regulations (including safety and environmental regulations), environmental liabilities, litigation, and rate proceedings;        •    Our costs and funding obligations for defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans;        •    Changes in maintenance and construction costs;        •    Changes in the current geopolitical situation;        •    Our exposure to the credit risk of our customers and counterparties;        •    Risks related to strategy and financing, including restrictions stemming from our debt agreements, future changes in our credit ratings and the availability and cost of credit;        •    The amount of cash distributions from and capital requirements of our investments and joint ventures in which we participate;        •    Risks associated with future weather conditions;        •    Acts of terrorism, including cybersecurity threats and related disruptions; and        •    Additional risks described in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Given the uncertainties and risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement, we caution investors not to unduly rely on our forward-looking statements. We disclaim any obligations to and do not intend to update the above list or to announce publicly the result of any revisions to any of the forward-looking statements to reflect future events or developments.  In addition to causing our actual results to differ, the factors listed above and referred to below may cause our intentions to change from those statements of intention set forth in this report. Such changes in our intentions may also cause our results to differ. We may change our intentions, at any time and without notice, based upon changes in such factors, our assumptions, or otherwise.  Because forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, we caution that there are important factors, in addition to those listed above, that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. These factors are described in the following section.    26    Table of Contents RISK FACTORS  You should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information in this report. Each of these factors could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition, as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in our securities.  Prices for NGLs, olefins, natural gas, oil and other commodities, are volatile and this volatility could adversely affect our financial results, cash flows, access to capital and ability to maintain our existing businesses.  Our revenues, operating results, future rate of growth and the value of certain components of our businesses depend primarily upon the prices of NGLs, olefins, natural gas, oil or other commodities, and the differences between prices of these commodities. Price volatility can impact both the amount we receive for our products and services and the volume of products and services we sell. Prices affect the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures and our ability to borrow money or raise additional capital. Any of the foregoing can also have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.  The markets for NGLs, olefins, natural gas, oil and other commodities are likely to continue to be volatile. Wide fluctuations in prices might result from relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for these commodities, market uncertainty and other factors that are beyond our control, including:        •    Worldwide and domestic supplies of and demand for natural gas, NGLs, olefins, oil, petroleum, and related commodities;        •    Turmoil in the Middle East and other producing regions;        •    The activities of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries;        •    Terrorist attacks on production or transportation assets;        •    Weather conditions;        •    The level of consumer demand;        •    The price and availability of other types of fuels or feedstocks;        •    The availability of pipeline capacity;        •    Supply disruptions, including plant outages and transportation disruptions;        •    The price and quantity of foreign imports of natural gas and oil;        •    Domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes;        •    Volatility in the natural gas and oil markets;        •    The overall economic environment;        •    The credit of participants in the markets where products are bought and sold; and        •    The adoption of regulations or legislation relating to climate change and changes in natural gas production from exploration and production areas that we serve.  The long-term financial condition of our natural gas transportation and midstream businesses is dependent on the continued availability of natural gas supplies in the supply basins that we access, demand for those supplies in our traditional markets, and the prices of natural gas.  The development of the additional natural gas reserves that are essential for our natural gas transportation and midstream businesses to thrive requires significant capital expenditures by others for exploration and development drilling and the installation of production, gathering, storage, transportation and other facilities that permit natural gas to be produced and delivered to our pipeline systems. Low prices for natural gas, regulatory    27    Table of Contents  limitations, including environmental regulations, or the lack of available capital for these projects could adversely affect the development and production of additional reserves, as well as gathering, storage, pipeline transportation and import and export of natural gas supplies, adversely impacting our ability to fill the capacities of our gathering, transportation and processing facilities.  Production from existing wells and natural gas supply basins with access to our pipeline and gathering systems will also naturally decline over time. The amount of natural gas reserves underlying these wells may also be less than anticipated, and the rate at which production from these reserves declines may be greater than anticipated. Additionally, the competition for natural gas supplies to serve other markets could reduce the amount of natural gas supply for our customers. Accordingly, to maintain or increase the contracted capacity or the volume of natural gas transported on or gathered through our pipeline systems and cash flows associated with the gathering and transportation of natural gas, our customers must compete with others to obtain adequate supplies of natural gas. In addition, if natural gas prices in the supply basins connected to our pipeline systems are higher than prices in other natural gas producing regions, our ability to compete with other transporters may be negatively impacted on a short-term basis, as well as with respect to our long-term recontracting activities. If new supplies of natural gas are not obtained to replace the natural decline in volumes from existing supply areas, if natural gas supplies are diverted to serve other markets in which we have a limited or no presence, if development in new supply basins where we do not have significant gathering or pipeline systems reduces demand for our services, or if environmental regulators restrict new natural gas drilling, the overall volume of natural gas transported, gathered and stored on our systems would decline, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, new LNG import facilities built near our markets could result in less demand for our gathering and transportation facilities.  We may not be able to grow or effectively manage our growth.  A principal focus of our strategy is to capitalize on growth opportunities. Our future growth will depend upon our ability to successfully identify, finance, acquire, integrate and operate projects and businesses. Failure to achieve any of these factors would adversely affect our ability to achieve growth.  We have recently completed, or are in the process of completing, significant growth acquisitions and construction projects and may engage in similar growth activities in the future to capture anticipated future demand for natural gas, NGL and olefins infrastructure. This demand may not ultimately materialize. As a result, our new or expanded facilities or businesses may not achieve profitability. In addition, the process of integrating newly acquired or constructed assets into our operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties, may absorb significant management attention and may require financial resources that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development and expansion of our existing operations. Acquisitions or construction projects may require substantial new capital and could result in the incurrence of indebtedness, additional liabilities and excessive costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders. If we issue additional equity in connection with future growth activities, stockholders’ ownership interest in us may be diluted and dividends we pay to our stockholders may be reduced. Further, any limitations on our access to capital, including limitations caused by illiquidity in the capital markets, may impair our ability to complete future acquisitions and construction projects on favorable terms, if at all.  Our acquisition attempts may not be successful or may result in completed acquisitions that do not perform as anticipated.  We have made and may continue to make acquisitions of businesses and properties. However, suitable acquisition candidates may not continue to be available on terms and conditions we find acceptable. The following are some of the risks associated with acquisitions, including any completed or future acquisitions:        •    Some of the acquired businesses or properties may not produce revenues, earnings or cash flow at anticipated levels or could have environmental, permitting or other problems for which contractual protections prove inadequate;    28    Table of Contents     •    We may lose all or part of the value of our investment or be required to contribute additional capital to support businesses or properties acquired;        •    We may assume liabilities that were not disclosed to us or that exceed our estimates;        •    We may be unable to integrate acquired businesses successfully and realize anticipated economic, operational and other benefits in a timely manner, which could result in substantial costs and delays or other operational, technical or financial problems; and        •    Acquisitions could disrupt our ongoing business, distract management, divert resources and make it difficult to maintain our current business standards, controls and procedures.  Execution of our capital projects subjects us to construction risks, increases in labor costs and materials, and other risks that may adversely affect financial results.  Our growth may be dependent upon the construction of new natural gas gathering, transportation, compression, processing or treating pipelines and facilities, NGL fractionation or storage facilities or olefins processing facilities, as well as the expansion of existing facilities. Construction or expansion of these facilities is subject to various regulatory, development and operational risks, including:        •    The ability to obtain necessary approvals and permits by regulatory agencies on a timely basis and on acceptable terms;        •    The availability of skilled labor, equipment, and materials to complete expansion projects;        •    Potential changes in federal, state and local statutes and regulations, including environmental requirements, that prevent a project from proceeding or increase the anticipated cost of the project;        •    Impediments on our ability to acquire rights-of-way or land rights on a timely basis and on acceptable terms;        •    The ability to construct projects within estimated costs, including the risk of cost overruns resulting from inflation or increased costs of equipment, materials, labor or other factors beyond our control, that may be material; and        •    The ability to access capital markets to fund construction projects.  Any of these risks could prevent a project from proceeding, delay its completion or increase its anticipated costs. As a result, new facilities may not achieve expected investment return, which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.  We do not own all of the interests in the Partially Owned Entities, which could adversely affect our ability to operate and control these assets in a manner beneficial to us.  Because we do not control the Partially Owned Entities, we may have limited flexibility to control the operation of or cash distributions received from these entities. The Partially Owned Entities’ organizational documents require distribution of their available cash to their members on a quarterly basis; however, in each case, available cash is reduced, in part, by reserves appropriate for operating the businesses. At December 31, 2012, our investments in the Partially Owned Entities accounted for approximately 16 percent of our total consolidated assets. We expect that conflicts of interest may arise in the future between us, on the one hand, and our Partially Owned Entities, on the other hand, with regard to our Partially Owned Entities’ governance, business and operations. If a conflict of interest arises between us and a Partially Owned Entity, other owners may control the Partially Owned Entity’s actions with respect to such matter (subject to certain limitations), which could be detrimental to our business. Any future disagreements with the other co-owners of these assets could adversely affect our ability to respond to changing economic or industry conditions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.    29    Table of Contents Holders of our common stock may not receive dividends in the amount identified in guidance or any dividends at all.  We may not have sufficient cash flow each quarter to make dividends or maintain current or expected levels of dividends. The actual amount of cash we dividend will depend on the following factors, some of which are beyond our control, among others:        •    The amount of cash that WPZ and our other subsidiaries and the Partially Owned Entities distribute to us;        •    The amount of cash we generate from our operations, which is subject to prices we obtain for our services, the prices of natural gas, NGLs and olefins, and the volumes of gas we process and NGLs and olefins we fractionate and store, and our operating costs;        •    The level of capital expenditures we make;        •    The restrictions contained in our indentures and Credit Facility and our debt service requirements;        •    The cost of acquisitions, if any;        •    Fluctuations in our working capital needs; and        •    Our ability to borrow.  Our cash flow depends heavily on the earnings and distributions of WPZ  Our partnership interest in WPZ is our largest cash-generating asset. Therefore, our cash flow is heavily dependent upon the ability of WPZ to make distributions to its partners. A significant decline in WPZ’s earnings and/or distributions would have a corresponding negative impact on us.  Our industry is highly competitive, and increased competitive pressure could adversely affect our business and operating results.  We have numerous competitors in all aspects of our businesses, and additional competitors may enter our markets. Some of our competitors are large oil, natural gas and petrochemical companies that have greater access to supplies of natural gas and NGLs than we do. In addition, current or potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or have greater financial resources than we do, which could affect our ability to make investments or acquisitions. Other companies with which we compete may be able to respond more quickly to new laws or regulations or emerging technologies or to devote greater resources to the construction, expansion or refurbishment of their facilities than we can. Similarly, a highly-liquid competitive commodity market in natural gas and increasingly competitive markets for natural gas services, including competitive secondary markets in pipeline capacity, have developed. As a result, pipeline capacity is being used more efficiently, and peaking and storage services are increasingly effective substitutes for annual pipeline capacity. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors and any failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.  We may not be able to replace, extend, or add additional customer contracts or contracted volumes on favorable terms, if at all, which could affect our financial condition, the amount of cash available to pay dividends, and our ability to grow.  We rely on a limited number of customers and producers for a significant portion of our revenues and supply of natural gas and NGLs. Although many of our customers and suppliers are subject to long-term contracts, if we are unable to replace or extend such contracts or add additional customers, each on favorable terms, if at all, our financial condition, growth plans, and the amount of cash available to pay distributions could be adversely affected. Our ability to replace, extend, or add additional significant customer or supplier contracts on favorable terms is subject to a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control, including, but not limited to:        •    The level of existing and new competition in our businesses or from alternative fuel sources, such as electricity, coal, fuel oils, or nuclear energy.    30    Table of Contents     •    Natural gas, NGL, and olefins prices, demand, availability and margins in our markets. Higher prices for energy commodities related to our businesses could result in a decline in the demand for those commodities and, therefore, in customer contracts or throughput on our pipeline systems. Also, lower energy commodity prices could result in a decline in the production of energy commodities resulting in reduced customer contracts, supply contracts, and throughput on our pipeline systems.        •    General economic, financial markets and industry conditions.        •    The effects of regulation on us, our customers and contracting practices.  Our operations are subject to operational hazards and unforeseen interruptions for which they may not be adequately insured.  There are operational risks associated with the gathering, transporting, storage, processing and treating of natural gas, the fractionation, transportation and storage of NGLs, processing of olefins, and crude oil transportation and production handling, including:        •    Hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, fires, extreme weather conditions, and other natural disasters;        •    Aging infrastructure and mechanical problems;        •    Damages to pipelines and pipeline blockages or other pipeline interruptions;        •    Uncontrolled releases of natural gas (including sour gas), NGLs, brine or industrial chemicals;        •    Collapse or failure of storage caverns;        •    Operator error;        •    Damage caused by third-party activity, such as operation of construction equipment;        •    Pollution and other environmental risks;        •    Fires, explosions, craterings and blowouts;        •    Truck and rail loading and unloading;        •    Operating in a marine environment; and        •    Terrorist attacks or threatened attacks on our facilities or those of other energy companies.  Any of these risks could result in loss of human life, personal injuries, significant damage to property, environmental pollution, impairment of our operations and substantial losses to us. In accordance with customary industry practice, we maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these risks and losses, and only at levels we believe to be appropriate. The location of certain segments of our facilities in or near populated areas, including residential areas, commercial business centers and industrial sites, could increase the level of damages resulting from these risks. In spite of our precautions, an event such as those described above could cause considerable harm to people or property, and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, particularly if the event is not fully covered by insurance. Accidents or other operating risks could further result in loss of service available to our customers.  We do not insure against all potential losses and could be seriously harmed by unexpected liabilities or by the inability of our insurers to satisfy our claims.  We are not fully insured against all risks inherent to our business, including environmental accidents. We do not maintain insurance in the type and amount to cover all possible risks of loss. We currently maintain excess liability insurance with limits of $610 million per occurrence and in the annual aggregate with a $2 million per occurrence deductible. This insurance covers us, our subsidiaries, and    31    Table of Contents  certain of our affiliates for legal and contractual liabilities arising out of bodily injury or property damage, including resulting loss of use to third parties. This excess liability insurance includes coverage for sudden and accidental pollution liability for full limits, with the first $135 million of insurance also providing gradual pollution liability coverage for natural gas and NGL operations. Although we maintain property insurance on certain physical assets that we own, lease or are responsible to insure, the policy may not cover the full replacement cost of all damaged assets or the entire amount of business interruption loss we may experience. In addition, certain perils may be excluded from coverage or be sub-limited. We may not be able to maintain or obtain insurance of the type and amount we desire at reasonable rates. We may elect to self insure a portion of our risks. We do not insure our onshore underground pipelines for physical damage, except at certain locations such as river crossings and compressor stations. Offshore assets are covered for property damage when loss is due to a named windstorm event but coverage for loss caused by a named windstorm is significantly sub-limited and subject to a large deductible. All of our insurance is subject to deductibles. If a significant accident or event occurs for which we are not fully insured it could adversely affect our operations and financial condition.  In addition, to the insurance coverage described above, we are a member of Oil Insurance Limited (OIL), an energy industry mutual insurance company, which provides coverage for damage to our property. As an insured member of OIL, we share in the losses among other OIL members even if our property is not damaged.  Furthermore, any insurance company that provides coverage to us may experience negative developments that could impair their ability to pay any of our claims. As a result, we could be exposed to greater losses than anticipated and may have to obtain replacement insurance, if available, at a greater cost.  The occurrence of any risks not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and our ability to repay our debt.  Our assets and operations can be adversely affected by weather and other natural phenomena.  Our assets and operations, especially those located offshore, can be adversely affected by hurricanes, floods, earthquakes, landslides, tornadoes and other natural phenomena and weather conditions, including extreme or unseasonable temperatures, making it more difficult for us to realize the historic rates of return associated with these assets and operations. A significant disruption in operations or a significant liability for which we are not fully insured could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  Acts of terrorism could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  Our assets and the assets of our customers and others may be targets of terrorist activities that could disrupt our business or cause significant harm to our operations, such as full or partial disruption to our ability to produce, process, transport or distribute natural gas, NGLs or other commodities. Acts of terrorism as well as events occurring in response to or in connection with acts of terrorism could cause environmental repercussions that could result in a significant decrease in revenues or significant reconstruction or remediation costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  Our business could be negatively impacted by security threats, including cybersecurity threats, and related disruptions.  We rely on our information technology infrastructure to process, transmit and store electronic information, including information we use to safely operate our assets. While we believe that we maintain appropriate information security policies and protocols, we face cybersecurity and other security threats to our information    32    Table of Contents  technology infrastructure, which could include threats to our operational and safety systems that operate our pipelines, plants and assets. We could face unlawful attempts to gain access to our information technology infrastructure, including coordinated attacks from hackers, whether state-sponsored groups, “hacktivists,” or private individuals. The age, operating systems or condition of our current information technology infrastructure and software assets and our ability to maintain and upgrade such assets could affect our ability to resist cybersecurity threats. We could also face attempts to gain access to information related to our assets through attempts to obtain unauthorized access by targeting acts of deception against individuals with legitimate access to physical locations or information.  Our information technology infrastructure is critical to the efficient operation of our business and essential to our ability to perform day-to-day operations. Breaches in our information technology infrastructure or physical facilities, or other disruptions, could result in damage to our assets, safety incidents, damage to the environment, potential liability or the loss of contracts, and have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial position and results of operations.  We could be subject to penalties and fines if we fail to comply with laws governing our businesses.  Our businesses are regulated by numerous governmental agencies including, but not limited to, the FERC, the EPA and the PHMSA. Should we fail to comply with applicable statutes, rules, regulations and orders, our businesses could be subject to substantial penalties and fines. For example, under the Energy Policy Act of 2005, FERC has civil penalty authority under the Natural Gas Act (NGA) to impose penalties for current violations of up to $1,000,000 per day for each violation and under the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Job Creation Act of 2011, the PHMSA has civil penalty authority up to $200,000 per day, with a maximum of $2 million for any related series of violations. Any material penalties or fines under these or other statutes, rules, regulations or orders could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  The natural gas sales, transportation and storage operations of our gas pipelines are subject to regulation by the FERC, which could have an adverse impact on their ability to establish transportation and storage rates that would allow them to recover the full cost of operating their respective pipelines, including a reasonable rate of return.  The natural gas sales, transmission and storage operations of the gas pipelines are subject to federal, state and local regulatory authorities. Specifically, their interstate pipeline transportation and storage service is subject to regulation by the FERC. The federal regulation extends to such matters as:        •    Transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce;        •    Rates, operating terms, and conditions of service, including initiation and discontinuation of service;        •    The types of services the gas pipelines may offer their customers;        •    Certification and construction of new interstate pipelines and storage facilities;        •    Acquisition, extension, disposition or abandonment of existing interstate pipelines and storage facilities;        •    Accounts and records;        •    Depreciation and amortization policies;        •    Relationships with affiliated companies who are involved in marketing functions of the natural gas business; and        •    Market manipulation in connection with interstate sales, purchases or transportation of natural gas.  Under the NGA, the FERC has authority to regulate providers of natural gas pipeline transportation and storage services in interstate commerce, and such providers may only charge rates that have been determined to    33    Table of Contents  be just and reasonable by the FERC. In addition, the FERC prohibits providers from unduly preferring or unreasonably discriminating against any person with respect to pipeline rates or terms and conditions of service.  Regulatory actions in these areas can affect our business in many ways, including decreasing tariff rates and revenues, decreasing volumes in our pipelines, increasing our costs and otherwise altering the profitability of our pipeline business.  The rates, terms and conditions for interstate gas pipeline services are set forth in FERC-approved tariffs. Any successful complaint or protest against the rates of the gas pipelines could have an adverse impact on their revenues associated with providing transportation services.  We are subject to risks associated with climate change and the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions.  Climate change and the costs that may be associated with its impacts and with the regulation of emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) have the potential to affect our business in many ways, including negatively impacting the costs we incur in providing our products and services, the demand for and consumption of our products and services (due to change in both costs and weather patterns), and the economic health of the regions in which we operate, all of which can create financial risks.  In addition, legislative and regulatory responses related to GHGs and climate change create the potential for financial risk.  The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has issued a final determination that six GHG emissions are a threat to public safety and welfare and implemented permitting for new and/or modified large sources of GHG emissions. Increased public awareness and concern over climate change may result in additional state, regional and/or federal requirements to reduce or mitigate GHG emissions. The U.S. Congress and certain states have for some time been considering various forms of legislation related to GHG emissions and additional regulation of GHG emissions in our industry may be implemented under existing Clean Air Act programs. There have also been international efforts seeking legally binding reductions in emissions of GHGs.  Regulatory actions by the EPA or the passage of new climate change laws or regulations could result in increased costs to (i) operate and maintain our facilities, (ii) install new emission controls on our facilities and (iii) administer and manage any GHG emissions program. If we are unable to recover or pass through a significant level of our costs related to complying with climate change regulatory requirements imposed on us, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. To the extent financial markets view climate change and GHG emissions as a financial risk, this could negatively impact our cost of and access to capital. Legislation or regulations that may be adopted to address climate change could also affect the markets for our products and services by making our products and services less desirable than competing sources of energy.  Our operations are subject to governmental laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, which may expose us to significant costs, liabilities and expenditures that could exceed current expectations.  Substantial costs, liabilities, delays and other significant issues related to environmental laws and regulations are inherent in the gathering, transportation, storage, processing and treating of natural gas, fractionation, transportation and storage of NGLs, processing of olefins, and crude oil transportation and production handling, as a result, we may be required to make substantial expenditures that could exceed current expectations. Our operations are subject to extensive federal, state, tribal and local laws and regulations governing environmental protection, endangered and threatened species, the discharge of materials into the environment and the security of chemical and industrial facilities.  Various governmental authorities, including the EPA, the U.S. Department of the Interior, the Bureau of Indian Affairs and analogous state agencies and tribal governments, have the power to enforce compliance with    34    Table of Contents  these laws and regulations and the permits issued under them, oftentimes requiring difficult and costly actions. Failure to comply with these laws, regulations and permits may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of remedial obligations, the imposition of stricter conditions on or revocation of permits, the issuance of injunctions limiting or preventing some or all of our operations and delays in granting permits.  There is inherent risk of the incurrence of environmental costs and liabilities in our business, some of which may be material, due to our handling of the products as they are gathered, transported, processed, fractionated and stored, air emissions related to our operations, historical industry operations, waste and waste disposal practices, and the prior use of flow meters containing mercury. Joint and several, strict liability may be incurred without regard to fault under certain environmental laws and regulations, for the remediation of contaminated areas and in connection with spills or releases of materials associated with natural gas, oil and wastes on, under or from our properties and facilities. Private parties, including the owners of properties through which our pipeline and gathering systems pass and facilities where our wastes are taken for reclamation or disposal, may have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance as well as to seek damages for noncompliance with environmental laws and regulations or for personal injury or property damage arising from our operations. Some sites at which we operate are located near current or former third-party hydrocarbon storage and processing or oil and natural gas operations or facilities, and there is a risk that contamination has migrated from those sites to ours. Our insurance may not cover all environmental risks and costs or may not provide sufficient coverage if an environmental claim is made against us.  Our business may be adversely affected by changed regulations and increased costs due to stricter pollution control requirements or liabilities resulting from noncompliance with required operating or other regulatory permits. We make assumptions and develop expectations about possible expenditures related to environmental conditions based on current laws and regulations and current interpretation of those laws and regulations. If the interpretation of the laws and regulations themselves change, our assumptions and expectations may also change and any new capital costs incurred to comply with such changes may not be recoverable under our regulatory rate structure or our customer contracts. We might not be able to obtain or maintain from time to time all required environmental regulatory approvals for our operations. If there is a delay in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approvals, or if we fail to obtain and comply with them, the operation or construction of our facilities could be prevented or become subject to additional costs, resulting in potentially material adverse consequences to our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  We are generally responsible for all liabilities associated with the environmental condition of our facilities and assets, whether acquired or developed, regardless of when the liabilities arose and whether they are known or unknown. In connection with certain acquisitions and divestitures, we could acquire, or be required to provide indemnification against, environmental liabilities that could expose us to material losses, which may not be covered by insurance. In addition, the steps we could be required to take to bring certain facilities into compliance could be prohibitively expensive, and we might be required to shut down, divest or alter the operation of those facilities, which might cause us to incur losses.  Increased regulation of energy extraction activities, including hydraulic fracturing, could result in reductions or delays in drilling and completing new oil and natural gas wells, which could decrease the volumes of natural gas and other products that we transport, gather, process and treat.  Hydraulic fracturing, a practice involving the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into tight geologic formations to stimulate oil and natural gas production, is currently exempt from federal regulation pursuant to the federal Safe Drinking Water Act (except when the fracturing fluids or propping agents contain diesel fuels). However, public concerns have been raised related to its potential environmental impact and there have been recent initiatives at the federal, state and local levels to regulate or otherwise restrict the use of hydraulic fracturing. Several states have adopted regulations that impose permitting, disclosure and well-completion requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations. The EPA has also announced regulatory and    35    Table of Contents  enforcement initiatives related to hydraulic fracturing and other natural gas extraction and production activities. We cannot predict whether any additional federal, state or local laws or regulations will be enacted in this area and if so, what their provisions would be. If new regulations are imposed related to oil and gas extraction, or if additional levels of reporting, regulation or permitting moratoria are required or imposed related to hydraulic fracturing, the volumes of natural gas and other products that we transport, gather, process and treat could decline and our results of operations could be adversely affected.  If third-party pipelines and other facilities interconnected to our pipelines and facilities become unavailable to transport natural gas and NGLs or to treat natural gas, our revenues could be adversely affected.  We depend upon third-party pipelines and other facilities that provide delivery options to and from our pipelines and facilities for the benefit of our customers. Because we do not own these third-party pipelines or other facilities, their continuing operation is not within our control. If these pipelines or facilities were to become temporarily or permanently unavailable for any reason, or if throughput were reduced because of testing, line repair, damage to pipelines or facilities, reduced operating pressures, lack of capacity, increased credit requirements or rates charged by such pipelines or facilities or other causes, we and our customers would have reduced capacity to transport, store or deliver natural gas or NGL products to end use markets or to receive deliveries of mixed NGLs, thereby reducing our revenues. Any temporary or permanent interruption at any key pipeline interconnect or in operations on third-party pipelines or facilities that would cause a material reduction in volumes transported on our pipelines or our gathering systems or processed, fractionated, treated or stored at our facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.  Legal and regulatory proceedings and investigations relating to the energy industry have adversely affected our business and may continue to do so. The operation of our businesses might also be adversely affected by changes in government regulations or in their interpretation or implementation, or the introduction of new laws or regulations applicable to our businesses or our customers.  Public and regulatory scrutiny of the energy industry has resulted in increased regulations being either proposed or implemented. Such scrutiny has also resulted in various inquiries, investigations and court proceedings. Both the shippers on our pipelines and regulators have rights to challenge the rates we charge under certain circumstances. Any successful challenge could materially affect our results of operations.  Certain inquiries, investigations and court proceedings are ongoing. Adverse effects may continue as a result of the uncertainty of ongoing inquiries, investigations and court proceedings, or additional inquiries and proceedings by federal or state regulatory agencies or private plaintiffs. In addition, we cannot predict the outcome of any of these inquiries or whether these inquiries will lead to additional legal proceedings against us, civil or criminal fines or penalties, or other regulatory action, including legislation, which might be materially adverse to the operation of our business and our revenues and net income or increase our operating costs in other ways. Current legal proceedings or other matters against us, including environmental matters, suits, regulatory appeals and similar matters might result in adverse decisions against us. The result of such adverse decisions, either individually or in the aggregate, could be material and may not be covered fully or at all by insurance.  In addition, existing regulations might be revised or reinterpreted, new laws and regulations might be adopted or become applicable to us, our facilities or our customers, and future changes in laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and ability to pay interest on our indebtedness. For example, various legislative and regulatory reforms associated with pipeline safety and integrity have been proposed or enacted, including the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Job Creation Act of 2011 enacted on January 3, 2012. This law will result in the promulgation of new regulations to be administered by PHMSA affecting the operations of our gas pipelines including, but not limited to, requirements relating to pipeline inspection, installation of additional valves and other equipment and records verification. These reforms and any future changes in related laws and regulations could significantly increase our costs and impact our operations. In addition, the FERC or competition in our markets may not allow us to recover such costs in the rates we charge for our services.    36    Table of Contents Certain of our gas pipeline services are subject to long-term, fixed-price contracts that are not subject to adjustment, even if our cost to perform such services exceeds the revenues received from such contracts.  Our gas pipelines provide some services pursuant to long-term, fixed price contracts. It is possible that costs to perform services under such contracts will exceed the revenues they collect for their services. Although most of the services are priced at cost-based rates that are subject to adjustment in rate cases, under FERC policy, a regulated service provider and a customer may mutually agree to sign a contract for service at a “negotiated rate” that may be above or below the FERC regulated cost-based rate for that service. These “negotiated rate” contracts are not generally subject to adjustment for increased costs that could be produced by inflation or other factors relating to the specific facilities being used to perform the services.  Our operating results for certain components of our business might fluctuate on a seasonal and quarterly basis.  Revenues from certain components of our business can have seasonal characteristics. In many parts of the country, demand for natural gas and other fuels peaks during the winter. As a result, our overall operating results in the future might fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis. Demand for natural gas and other fuels could vary significantly from our expectations depending on the nature and location of our facilities and pipeline systems and the terms of our natural gas transportation arrangements relative to demand created by unusual weather patterns.  We do not own all of the land on which our pipelines and facilities are located, which could disrupt our operations.  We do not own all of the land on which our pipelines and facilities have been constructed. As such, we are subject to the possibility of increased costs to retain necessary land use. In those instances in which we do not own the land on which our facilities are located, we obtain the rights to construct and operate our pipelines and gathering systems on land owned by third parties and governmental agencies for a specific period of time. In addition, some of our facilities cross Native American lands pursuant to rights-of-way of limited term. We may not have the right of eminent domain over land owned by Native American tribes. Our loss of these rights, through our inability to renew right-of-way contracts or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.  Difficult conditions in the global capital markets, the credit markets and the economy in general could negatively affect our business and results of operations.  Our businesses may be negatively impacted by adverse economic conditions or future disruptions in global financial markets. Included among these potential negative impacts are reduced energy demand and lower prices for our products and services, increased difficulty in collecting amounts owed to us by our customers and a reduction in our credit ratings (either due to tighter rating standards or the negative impacts described above), which could reduce our access to credit markets, raise the cost of such access or require us to provide additional collateral to our counterparties. If financing is not available when needed, or is available only on unfavorable terms, we may be unable to implement our business plans or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures. In addition, financial markets have recently been affected by concerns over U.S. fiscal policy, including uncertainty regarding federal spending and tax policy, as well as the U.S. federal government’s debt ceiling and the federal deficit. These concerns, as well as actions taken by the U.S. federal government in response to these concerns, could significantly and adversely impact the global and U.S. economies and financial markets, which could negatively impact us in the manners described above.    37    Table of Contents A downgrade of our credit ratings could impact our liquidity, access to capital and our costs of doing business, and independent third parties outside of our control determine our credit ratings.  A downgrade of our credit ratings might increase our cost of borrowing and could require us to post collateral with third parties, negatively impacting our available liquidity. Our ability to access capital markets could also be limited by a downgrade of our credit ratings and other disruptions. Such disruptions could include:        •    Economic downturns;        •    Deteriorating capital market conditions;        •    Declining market prices for natural gas, NGLs, olefins, oil and other commodities;        •    Terrorist attacks or threatened attacks on our facilities or those of other energy companies; and        •    The overall health of the energy industry, including the bankruptcy or insolvency of other companies.  Credit rating agencies perform independent analysis when assigning credit ratings. This analysis includes a number of criteria including, but not limited to, business composition, market and operational risks, as well as various financial tests. Credit rating agencies continue to review the criteria for industry sectors and various debt ratings and may make changes to those criteria from time to time. Credit ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold investments in the rated entity. Ratings are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the ratings agencies, and no assurance can be given that we will maintain our current credit ratings.  We are exposed to the credit risk of our customers and counterparties, and our credit risk management may not be adequate to protect against such risk.  We are subject to the risk of loss resulting from nonpayment and/or nonperformance by our customers and counterparties in the ordinary course of our business. Generally, our customers are rated investment grade, are otherwise considered creditworthy or are required to make prepayments or provide security to satisfy credit concerns. However, our credit procedures and policies may not be adequate to fully eliminate customer and counterparty credit risk. We cannot predict to what extent our business would be impacted by deteriorating conditions in the economy, including declines in our customers’ and counterparties’ creditworthiness. If we fail to adequately assess the creditworthiness of existing or future customers and counterparties, unanticipated deterioration in their creditworthiness and any resulting increase in nonpayment and/or nonperformance by them could cause us to write down or write off doubtful accounts. Such write-downs or write-offs could negatively affect our operating results in the periods in which they occur, and, if significant, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.  Restrictions in our debt agreements and our leverage may affect our future financial and operating flexibility.  Our total outstanding long-term debt (including current portion) as of December 31, 2012, was $10.7 billion.  The agreements governing our indebtedness contain covenants that restrict our and our material subsidiaries’ ability to incur certain liens to support indebtedness and our ability to merge or consolidate or sell all or substantially all of our assets. In addition, certain of our debt agreements contain various covenants that restrict or limit, among other things, our ability to make certain distributions during the continuation of an event of default, the ability of our subsidiaries to incur additional debt, and our and our material subsidiaries’ ability to enter into certain affiliate transactions and certain restrictive agreements. Certain of our debt agreements also contain, and those we enter into in the future may contain, financial covenants and other limitations with which we will need to comply.  Our debt service obligations and the covenants described above could have important consequences. For example, they could:        •    Make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness, which could in turn result in an event of default on such indebtedness;    38    Table of Contents     •    Impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate purposes or other purposes;        •    Adversely affect our ability to pay cash dividends to stockholders;        •    Diminish our ability to withstand a continued or future downturn in our business or the economy generally;        •    Require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to debt service payments, thereby reducing the availability of cash for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate purposes or other purposes;        •    Limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate, including limiting our ability to expand or pursue our business activities and preventing us from engaging in certain transactions that might otherwise be considered beneficial to us;        •    Place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have proportionately less debt.  Our ability to comply with our debt covenants, to repay, extend or refinance our existing debt obligations and to obtain future credit will depend primarily on our operating performance, which will be affected by general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control and may differ materially from our current assumptions. Our ability to refinance existing debt obligations or obtain future credit will also depend upon the current conditions in the credit markets and the availability of credit generally. If we are unable to comply with these covenants, meet our debt service obligations or obtain future credit on favorable terms, or at all, we could be forced to restructure or refinance our indebtedness, seek additional equity capital or sell assets. We may be unable to obtain financing or sell assets on satisfactory terms, or at all.  Our failure to comply with the covenants in the documents governing our indebtedness could result in events of default, which could render such indebtedness due and payable. We may not have sufficient liquidity to repay our indebtedness in such circumstances. In addition, cross-default or cross-acceleration provisions in our debt agreements could cause a default or acceleration to have a wider impact on our liquidity than might otherwise arise from a default or acceleration of a single debt instrument. For more information regarding our debt agreements, please read “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Liquidity”.  We are not prohibited under our indentures from incurring additional indebtedness. Our incurrence of significant additional indebtedness would exacerbate the negative consequences mentioned above, and could adversely affect our ability to repay our existing indebtedness.  Institutional knowledge residing with current employees nearing retirement eligibility or with our former employees might not be adequately preserved.  In certain areas of our business, institutional knowledge resides with employees who have many years of service. As these employees reach retirement age their services are no longer available to us, we may not be able to replace them with employees of comparable knowledge and experience. In addition, we may not be able to retain or recruit other qualified individuals, and our efforts at knowledge transfer could be inadequate. If knowledge transfer, recruiting and retention efforts are inadequate, access to significant amounts of internal historical knowledge and expertise could become unavailable to us.  We might not be able to successfully manage the risks associated with selling and marketing products in the wholesale energy markets.  Our portfolio of derivative and other energy contracts may consist of wholesale contracts to buy and sell commodities, including contracts for natural gas, NGLs, olefins, and other commodities that are settled by the    39    Table of Contents  delivery of the commodity or cash throughout the United States. If the values of these contracts change in a direction or manner that we do not anticipate or cannot manage, it could negatively affect our results of operations. In the past, certain marketing and trading companies have experienced severe financial problems due to price volatility in the energy commodity markets. In certain instances this volatility has caused companies to be unable to deliver energy commodities that they had guaranteed under contract. If such a delivery failure were to occur in one of our contracts, we might incur additional losses to the extent of amounts, if any, already paid to, or received from, counterparties. In addition, in our businesses, we often extend credit to our counterparties. Despite performing credit analysis prior to extending credit, we are exposed to the risk that we might not be able to collect amounts owed to us. If the counterparty to such a transaction fails to perform and any collateral that secures our counterparty’s obligation is inadequate, we will suffer a loss. Downturns in the economy or disruptions in the global credit markets could cause more of our counterparties to fail to perform than we expect.  Our risk management and measurement systems and hedging activities might not be effective and could increase the volatility of our results.  The systems we use to quantify commodity price risk associated with our businesses might not always be followed or might not always be effective. Further, such systems do not in themselves manage risk, particularly risks outside of our control, and adverse changes in energy commodity market prices, volatility, adverse correlation of commodity prices, the liquidity of markets, changes in interest rates and other risks discussed in this report might still adversely affect our earnings, cash flows and balance sheet under applicable accounting rules, even if risks have been identified.  In an effort to manage our financial exposure related to commodity price and market fluctuations, we have entered, and may in the future enter into contracts to hedge certain risks associated with our assets and operations. In these hedging activities, we have used and may in the future use fixed-price, forward, physical purchase and sales contracts, futures, financial swaps and option contracts traded in the over-the-counter markets or on exchanges. Nevertheless, no single hedging arrangement can adequately address all risks present in a given contract. For example, a forward contract that would be effective in hedging commodity price volatility risks would not hedge the contract’s counterparty credit or performance risk. Therefore, unhedged risks will always continue to exist. While we attempt to manage counterparty credit risk within guidelines established by our credit policy, we may not be able to successfully manage all credit risk and as such, future cash flows and results of operations could be impacted by counterparty default.  Our use of hedging arrangements through which we attempt to reduce the economic risk of our participation in commodity markets could result in increased volatility of our reported results. Changes in the fair values (gains and losses) of derivatives that qualify as hedges under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), to the extent that such hedges are not fully effective in offsetting changes to the value of the hedged commodity, as well as changes in the fair value of derivatives that do not qualify or have not been designated as hedges under GAAP, must be recorded in our income. This creates the risk of volatility in earnings even if no economic impact to us has occurred during the applicable period.  The impact of changes in market prices for NGLs and natural gas on the average prices paid or received by us may be reduced based on the level of our hedging activities. These hedging arrangements may limit or enhance our margins if the market prices for NGLs or natural gas were to change substantially from the price established by the hedges. In addition, our hedging arrangements expose us to risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including instances in which:        •    Volumes are less than expected;        •    The hedging instrument is not perfectly effective in mitigating the risk being hedged; and        •    The counterparties to our hedging arrangements fail to honor their financial commitments.    40    Table of Contents The adoption and implementation of new statutory and regulatory requirements for derivative transactions could have an adverse impact on our ability to hedge risks associated with our business and increase the working capital requirements to conduct these activities.  In July 2010, federal legislation known as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) was enacted. The Dodd-Frank Act provides for new statutory and regulatory requirements for derivative transactions, including oil and gas hedging transactions. Among other things, the Dodd-Frank Act provides for the creation of position limits for certain derivatives transactions, as well as requiring certain transactions to be transacted on exchanges for which cash collateral will be required. These new rules and regulations could increase the cost of derivative contracts or reduce the availability of derivatives. Although we believe the derivative contracts that we enter into should not be impacted by position limits and should to a large extent be exempt from the requirement to trade these transactions on exchanges and to clear these transactions through a central clearing house or to post collateral, the impact upon our businesses will depend on the outcome of the implementing regulations that are continuing to be adopted by the Commodities Futures Trading Commission.  A number of our financial derivative transactions used for hedging purposes are currently executed on exchanges and cleared through clearing houses that already require the posting of margins based on initial and variation requirements. Final rules promulgated under the Dodd-Frank Act may require us to post additional cash or new margin to the clearing house or to our counterparties in connection with our hedging transactions. Posting such additional cash collateral could impact liquidity and reduce our cash available for capital expenditures or other corporate purposes. A requirement to post cash collateral could therefore reduce our ability to execute hedges to reduce commodity price uncertainty and thus protect cash flows. If we reduce our use of derivatives as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act and regulations, our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable.  Our costs and funding obligations for our defined benefit pension plans and costs for our other postretirement benefit plans are affected by factors beyond our control.  We have defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all of our U.S. employees and other post-retirement benefit plans covering certain eligible participants. The timing and amount of our funding requirements under the defined benefit pension plans depend upon a number of factors we control, including changes to pension plan benefits, as well as factors outside of our control, such as asset returns, interest rates and changes in pension laws. Changes to these and other factors that can significantly increase our funding requirements could have a significant adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.  One of our subsidiaries acts as the general partner of a publicly traded limited partnership, Williams Partners L.P. As such, this subsidiary’s operations may involve a greater risk of liability than ordinary business operations.  One of our subsidiaries acts as the general partner of WPZ, a publicly traded limited partnership. This subsidiary may be deemed to have undertaken fiduciary obligations with respect to WPZ as the general partner and to the limited partners of WPZ. Activities determined to involve fiduciary obligations to other persons or entities typically involve a higher standard of conduct than ordinary business operations and therefore may involve a greater risk of liability, particularly when a conflict of interest is found to exist. Our control of the general partner of WPZ may increase the possibility of claims of breach of fiduciary duties, including claims brought due to conflicts of interest (including conflicts of interest that may arise between WPZ, on the one hand, and its general partner and that general partner’s affiliates, including us, on the other hand). Any liability resulting from such claims could be material.  Potential changes in accounting standards might cause us to revise our financial results and disclosures in the future, which might change the way analysts measure our business or financial performance.  Regulators and legislators continue to take a renewed look at accounting practices, financial disclosures, and companies’ relationships with their independent public accounting firms. It remains unclear what new laws or    41    Table of Contents  regulations will be adopted, and we cannot predict the ultimate impact that any such new laws or regulations could have. In addition, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the SEC or the FERC could enact new accounting standards or the FERC could issue rules that might impact how we are required to record revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities and equity. Any significant change in accounting standards or disclosure requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.  Our investments and projects located outside of the United States expose us to risks related to the laws of other countries, and the taxes, economic conditions, fluctuations in currency rates, political conditions and policies of foreign governments. These risks might delay or reduce our realization of value from our international projects.  We currently own and might acquire and/or dispose of material energy-related investments and projects outside the United States. The economic, political and legal conditions and regulatory environment in the countries in which we have interests or in which we might pursue acquisition or investment opportunities present risks that are different from or greater than those in the United States. These risks include delays in construction and interruption of business, as well as risks of war, expropriation, nationalization, renegotiation, trade sanctions or nullification of existing contracts and changes in law or tax policy, including with respect to the prices we realize for the commodities we produce and sell. The uncertainty of the legal environment in certain foreign countries in which we develop or acquire projects or make investments could make it more difficult to obtain nonrecourse project financing or other financing on suitable terms, could adversely affect the ability of certain customers to honor their obligations with respect to such projects or investments and could impair our ability to enforce our rights under agreements relating to such projects or investments.  Operations and investments in foreign countries also can present currency exchange rate and convertibility, inflation and repatriation risk. In certain situations under which we develop or acquire projects or make investments, economic and monetary conditions and other factors could affect our ability to convert to U.S. dollars our earnings denominated in foreign currencies. In addition, risk from fluctuations in currency exchange rates can arise when our foreign subsidiaries expend or borrow funds in one type of currency, but receive revenue in another. In such cases, an adverse change in exchange rates can reduce our ability to meet expenses, including debt service obligations. We may or may not put contracts in place designed to mitigate our foreign currency exchange risks. We have some exposures that are not hedged and which could result in losses or volatility in our results of operations.  Failure of our service providers or disruptions to our outsourcing relationships might negatively impact our ability to conduct our business.  Certain of our accounting and information technology services are currently provided by third party vendors, and sometimes from service centers outside of the United States. Service provided pursuant to these agreements could be disrupted. Similarly, the expiration of such agreements or the transition of services between providers could lead to loss of institutional knowledge or service disruptions.  If there is a determination that the spin-off of WPX Energy, Inc. (WPX) stock to our stockholders is taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes because the facts, representations or undertakings underlying an IRS private letter ruling or a tax opinion are incorrect or for any other reason, then we and our stockholders could incur significant income tax liabilities.  In connection with our original separation plan that called for an initial public offering (IPO) of stock of WPX and a subsequent spin-off of our remaining shares of WPX to our stockholders, we obtained a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and an opinion of our outside tax advisor, to the effect that the distribution by us of WPX shares to our stockholders, and any related restructuring transaction undertaken by us, would not result in recognition for U.S. federal income tax purposes, of income, gain or loss to us or our stockholders under section 355 and section 368(a)(1)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the Code), except for cash payments made to our stockholders in lieu of fractional shares of WPX common stock. In    42    Table of Contents  addition, we received an opinion from our outside tax advisor to the effect that the spin-off pursuant to our revised separation plan which was ultimately consummated on December 31, 2011, which did not involve an IPO of WPX shares, would not result in the recognition, for federal income tax purposes, of income, gain or loss to us or our stockholders under section 355 and section 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code, except for cash payments made to our stockholders in lieu of fractional shares of WPX. The private letter ruling and opinion have relied on or will rely on certain facts, representations, and undertakings from us and WPX regarding the past and future conduct of the companies’ respective businesses and other matters. If any of these facts, representations, or undertakings are, or become, incorrect or are not otherwise satisfied, including as a result of certain significant changes in the stock ownership of us or WPX after the spin-off, or if the IRS disagrees with any such facts and representations upon audit, we and our stockholders may not be able to rely on the private letter ruling or the opinion of our tax advisor and could be subject to significant income tax liabilities.  The spin-off may expose us to potential liabilities arising out of state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws and legal dividend requirements that we did not assume in our agreements with WPX.  The spin-off is subject to review under various state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws. A court could deem the spin-off or certain internal restructuring transactions undertaken by us in connection with the separation to be a fraudulent conveyance or transfer. Fraudulent conveyances or transfers are defined to include transfers made or obligations incurred with the actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud current or future creditors or transfers made or obligations incurred for less than reasonably equivalent value when the debtor was insolvent, or that rendered the debtor insolvent, inadequately capitalized or unable to pay its debts as they become due. A court could void the transactions or impose substantial liabilities upon us, which could adversely affect our financial condition and our results of operations. Whether a transaction is a fraudulent conveyance or transfer will vary depending upon the jurisdiction whose law is being applied. Under the separation and distribution agreement between us and WPX, from and after the spin-off, each of WPX and we are responsible for the debts, liabilities and other obligations related to the business or businesses which each owns and operates. Although we do not expect to be liable for any such obligations not expressly assumed by us pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement, it is possible that a court would disregard the allocation agreed to between the parties, and require that we assume responsibility for obligations allocated to WPX, particularly if WPX were to refuse or were unable to pay or perform the subject allocated obligations.
