Item 1A.  Risk Factors   FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AND CAUTIONARY STATEMENT  FOR PURPOSES OF THE “SAFE HARBOR” PROVISIONS OF  THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995  Certain matters contained in this report include “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These forward-looking statements relate to anticipated financial performance, management’s plans and objectives for future operations, business prospects, outcome of regulatory proceedings, market conditions and other matters. We make these forward-looking statements in reliance on the safe harbor protections provided under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  All statements, other than statements of historical facts, included in this report that address activities, events or developments that we expect, believe or anticipate will exist or may occur in the future, are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements can be identified by various forms of words such as “anticipates,” “believes,” “seeks,” “could,” “may,” “should,” “continues,” “estimates,” “expects,” “forecasts,” “intends,” “might,” “goals,” “objectives,” “targets,” “planned,” “potential,” “projects,” “scheduled,” “will” or other similar expressions. These forward-looking statements are based on management’s beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to management and include, among others, statements regarding:         •    Amounts and nature of future capital expenditures;         •    Expansion and growth of our business and operations;         •    Financial condition and liquidity;         •    Business strategy;         •    Cash flow from operations or results of operations;         •    Seasonality of certain business components;         •    Natural gas, natural gas liquids and crude oil prices and demand.  Forward-looking statements are based on numerous assumptions, uncertainties and risks that could cause future events or results to be materially different from those stated or implied in this report. Many of the factors that will determine these results are beyond our ability to control or predict. Specific factors that could cause actual results to differ from results contemplated by the forward-looking statements include, among others, the following:         •    Availability of supplies, market demand, volatility of prices, and the availability and cost of capital;         •    Inflation, interest rates, fluctuation in foreign exchange, and general economic conditions (including future disruptions and volatility in the global credit markets and the impact of these events on our customers and suppliers);         •    The strength and financial resources of our competitors;         •    Ability to acquire new businesses and assets and integrate those operations and assets into our existing businesses, as well as expand our facilities;         •    Development of alternative energy sources;         •    The impact of operational and development hazards;         •    Costs of, changes in, or the results of laws, government regulations (including safety and climate change regulation and changes in natural gas production from exploration and production areas that we serve), environmental liabilities, litigation, and rate proceedings;    21         •    Our costs and funding obligations for defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans;         •    Changes in maintenance and construction costs;         •    Changes in the current geopolitical situation;         •    Our exposure to the credit risk of our customers and counterparties;         •    Risks related to strategy and financing, including restrictions stemming from our debt agreements, future changes in our credit ratings and the availability and cost of credit;         •    Risks associated with future weather conditions;         •    Acts of terrorism, including cybersecurity threats and related disruptions;         •    Additional risks described in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Given the uncertainties and risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement, we caution investors not to unduly rely on our forward-looking statements. We disclaim any obligations to and do not intend to update the above list or to announce publicly the result of any revisions to any of the forward-looking statements to reflect future events or developments.  In addition to causing our actual results to differ, the factors listed above and referred to below may cause our intentions to change from those statements of intention set forth in this report. Such changes in our intentions may also cause our results to differ. We may change our intentions, at any time and without notice, based upon changes in such factors, our assumptions, or otherwise.  Because forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, we caution that there are important factors, in addition to those listed above, that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. These factors are described in the following section.    22    RISK FACTORS  You should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information in this report. Each of these factors could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition, as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in our securities.  Risks Related to the Spin-Off  The separation of our exploration and production business may not achieve its intended results.  The separation of our exploration and production business, completed on December 31, 2011, may not achieve its intended results and could have an adverse effect on us due to a number of factors. For example, the separation has significantly reduced the scope and scale of our business, we may not be able to grow as expected and we may incur proportionately higher costs to operate.  If there is a determination that the spin-off of WPX stock to our stockholders is taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes because the facts, representations, or undertakings underlying an IRS private letter ruling or a tax opinion are incorrect or for any other reason, then we and our stockholders could incur significant income tax liabilities.  In connection with our original separation plan that called for an initial public offering (IPO) of stock of WPX and a subsequent spin-off of our remaining shares of WPX to our stockholders, we obtained a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and an opinion of our outside tax advisor, to the effect that the distribution by us of WPX shares to our stockholders, and any related restructuring transaction undertaken by us, would not result in recognition for U.S. federal income tax purposes, of income, gain, or loss to us or our stockholders under section 355 and section 368(a)(1)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the Code), except for cash payments made to our stockholders in lieu of fractional shares of WPX common stock. In addition, we received an opinion from our outside tax advisor to the effect that the spin-off pursuant to our revised separation plan which was ultimately consummated on December 31, 2011, which did not involve an IPO of WPX shares, would not result in the recognition, for federal income tax purposes, of income, gain, or loss to us or our stockholders under section 355 and section 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code, except for cash payments made to our stockholders in lieu of fractional shares of WPX. The private letter ruling and opinion have relied on or will rely on certain facts, representations, and undertakings from us and WPX regarding the past and future conduct of the companies’ respective businesses and other matters. If any of these facts, representations, or undertakings are, or become, incorrect or are not otherwise satisfied, including as a result of certain significant changes in the stock ownership of us or WPX after the spin-off, or if the IRS disagrees with any such facts and representations upon audit, we and our stockholders may not be able to rely on the private letter ruling or the opinion of our tax advisor and could be subject to significant income tax liabilities.  The spin-off may expose us to potential liabilities arising out of state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws and legal dividend requirements that we did not assume in our agreements with WPX.  The spin-off is subject to review under various state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws. A court could deem the spin-off or certain internal restructuring transactions undertaken by us in connection with the separation to be a fraudulent conveyance or transfer. Fraudulent conveyances or transfers are defined to include transfers made or obligations incurred with the actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud current or future creditors or transfers made or obligations incurred for less than reasonably equivalent value when the debtor was insolvent, or that rendered the debtor insolvent, inadequately capitalized or unable to pay its debts as they become due. A court could void the transactions or impose substantial liabilities upon us, which could adversely affect our financial condition and our results of operations. Whether a transaction is a fraudulent conveyance or transfer will vary depending upon the jurisdiction whose law is being applied. Under the separation and distribution agreement between us and WPX, from and after the spin-off, each of WPX and we are responsible for the debts, liabilities and other obligations related to the business or businesses which each owns and operates. Although we do not expect to be liable for any such obligations not expressly assumed by us pursuant to the separation and    23     distribution agreement, it is possible that a court would disregard the allocation agreed to between the parties, and require that we assume responsibility for obligations allocated to WPX, particularly if WPX were to refuse or were unable to pay or perform the subject allocated obligations.  Risks Related to our Business  The long-term financial condition of our natural gas pipeline and midstream businesses is dependent on the continued availability of natural gas supplies in the supply basins that we access, demand for those supplies in our traditional markets, and the prices of and market demand for natural gas.  The development of the additional natural gas reserves that are essential for our gas pipeline and midstream businesses to thrive requires significant capital expenditures by others for exploration and development drilling and the installation of production, gathering, storage, transportation and other facilities that permit natural gas to be produced and delivered to our pipeline systems. Low prices for natural gas, regulatory limitations, including environmental regulations, or the lack of available capital for these projects could adversely affect the development and production of additional reserves, as well as gathering, storage, pipeline transportation and import and export of natural gas supplies, adversely impacting our ability to fill the capacities of our gathering, transportation and processing facilities.  Production from existing wells and natural gas supply basins with access to our pipeline and gathering systems will also naturally decline over time. The amount of natural gas reserves underlying these wells may also be less than anticipated, and the rate at which production from these reserves declines may be greater than anticipated. Additionally, the competition for natural gas supplies to serve other markets could reduce the amount of natural gas supply for our customers. Accordingly, to maintain or increase the contracted capacity or the volume of natural gas transported on or gathered through our pipeline systems and cash flows associated with the gathering and transportation of natural gas, our customers must compete with others to obtain adequate supplies of natural gas. In addition, if natural gas prices in the supply basins connected to our pipeline systems are higher than prices in other natural gas producing regions, our ability to compete with other transporters may be negatively impacted on a short-term basis, as well as with respect to our long-term recontracting activities. If new supplies of natural gas are not obtained to replace the natural decline in volumes from existing supply areas, if natural gas supplies are diverted to serve other markets, if development in new supply basins where we do not have significant gathering or pipeline systems reduces demand for our services, or if environmental regulators restrict new natural gas drilling, the overall volume of natural gas transported, gathered and stored on our system would decline, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, new LNG import facilities built near our markets could result in less demand for our gathering and transportation facilities.  Significant prolonged changes in natural gas prices could affect supply and demand and cause a termination of our long-term transportation and storage contracts or a reduction in throughput on the gas pipeline systems.  Higher natural gas prices over the long term could result in a decline in the demand for natural gas and, therefore, in long-term transportation and storage contracts or throughput on our gas pipeline systems. Also, lower natural gas prices over the long term could result in a decline in the production of natural gas resulting in reduced contracts or throughput on the gas pipeline systems. As a result, significant prolonged changes in natural gas prices could have a material adverse effect on our gas pipeline business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  Prices for NGLs, natural gas and other commodities, including oil, are volatile and this volatility could adversely affect our financial results, cash flows, access to capital and ability to maintain our existing businesses.  Our revenues, operating results, future rate of growth and the value of certain components of our businesses depend primarily upon the prices of NGLs, natural gas, oil, or other commodities, and the differences between    24     prices of these commodities. Price volatility can impact both the amount we receive for our products and services and the volume of products and services we sell. Prices affect the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures and our ability to borrow money or raise additional capital. Any of the foregoing can also have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.  The markets for NGLs, natural gas, oil and other commodities are likely to continue to be volatile. Wide fluctuations in prices might result from relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for these commodities, market uncertainty and other factors that are beyond our control, including:         •    Worldwide and domestic supplies of and demand for natural gas, NGLs, oil, petroleum, and related commodities;         •    Turmoil in the Middle East and other producing regions;         •    The activities of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries;         •    Terrorist attacks on production or transportation assets;         •    Weather conditions;         •    The level of consumer demand;         •    The price and availability of other types of fuels;         •    The availability of pipeline capacity;         •    Supply disruptions, including plant outages and transportation disruptions;         •    The price and quantity of foreign imports of natural gas and oil;         •    Domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes;         •    Volatility in the natural gas and oil markets;         •    The overall economic environment;         •    The credit of participants in the markets where products are bought and sold;         •    The adoption of regulations or legislation relating to climate change and changes in natural gas production from exploration and production areas that we serve.  We might not be able to successfully manage the risks associated with selling and marketing products in the wholesale energy markets.  Our portfolio of derivative and other energy contracts may consist of wholesale contracts to buy and sell commodities, including contracts for natural gas, NGLs and other commodities that are settled by the delivery of the commodity or cash throughout the United States. If the values of these contracts change in a direction or manner that we do not anticipate or cannot manage, it could negatively affect our results of operations. In the past, certain marketing and trading companies have experienced severe financial problems due to price volatility in the energy commodity markets. In certain instances this volatility has caused companies to be unable to deliver energy commodities that they had guaranteed under contract. If such a delivery failure were to occur in one of our contracts, we might incur additional losses to the extent of amounts, if any, already paid to, or received from, counterparties. In addition, in our businesses, we often extend credit to our counterparties. Despite performing credit analysis prior to extending credit, we are exposed to the risk that we might not be able to collect amounts owed to us. If the counterparty to such a transaction fails to perform and any collateral that secures our counterparty’s obligation is inadequate, we will suffer a loss. Downturns in the economy or disruptions in the global credit markets could cause more of our counterparties to fail to perform than we expect.    25    Certain of our gas pipeline services are subject to long-term, fixed-price contracts that are not subject to adjustment, even if our cost to perform such services exceeds the revenues received from such contracts.  Our gas pipelines provide some services pursuant to long-term, fixed price contracts. It is possible that costs to perform services under such contracts will exceed the revenues they collect for their services. Although most of the services are priced at cost-based rates that are subject to adjustment in rate cases, under FERC policy, a regulated service provider and a customer may mutually agree to sign a contract for service at a “negotiated rate” that may be above or below the FERC regulated cost-based rate for that service. These “negotiated rate” contracts are not generally subject to adjustment for increased costs that could be produced by inflation or other factors relating to the specific facilities being used to perform the services.  We may not be able to maintain or replace expiring natural gas transportation and storage contracts at favorable rates or on a long-term basis.  Our primary exposure to market risk for our gas pipelines occurs at the time the terms of their existing transportation and storage contracts expire and are subject to termination. Upon expiration of the terms, we may not be able to extend contracts with existing customers to obtain replacement contracts at favorable rates or on a long-term basis.  The extension or replacement of existing contracts depends on a number of factors beyond our control, including:         •    The level of existing and new competition to deliver natural gas to our markets;         •    The growth in demand for natural gas in our markets;         •    Whether the market will continue to support long-term firm contracts;         •    Whether our business strategy continues to be successful;         •    The level of competition for natural gas supplies in the production basins serving us;         •    The effects of state regulation on customer contracting practices.  Any failure to extend or replace a significant portion of our existing contracts may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  Our risk management and measurement systems and hedging activities might not be effective and could increase the volatility of our results.  The systems we use to quantify commodity price risk associated with our businesses might not always be followed or might not always be effective. Further, such systems do not in themselves manage risk, particularly risks outside of our control, and adverse changes in energy commodity market prices, volatility, adverse correlation of commodity prices, the liquidity of markets, changes in interest rates and other risks discussed in this report might still adversely affect our earnings, cash flows and balance sheet under applicable accounting rules, even if risks have been identified.  In an effort to manage our financial exposure related to commodity price and market fluctuations, we have entered and may in the future enter into contracts to hedge certain risks associated with our assets and operations. In these hedging activities, we have used and may in the future use fixed-price, forward, physical purchase and sales contracts, futures, financial swaps and option contracts traded in the over-the-counter markets or on exchanges. Nevertheless, no single hedging arrangement can adequately address all risks present in a given contract. For example, a forward contract that would be effective in hedging commodity price volatility risks would not hedge the contract’s counterparty credit or performance risk. Therefore, unhedged risks will always continue to exist. While we attempt to manage counterparty credit risk within guidelines established by our credit policy, we may not be able to successfully manage all credit risk and as such, future cash flows and results of operations could be impacted by counterparty default.    26    Our use of hedging arrangements through which we attempt to reduce the economic risk of our participation in commodity markets could result in increased volatility of our reported results. Changes in the fair values (gains and losses) of derivatives that qualify as hedges under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), to the extent that such hedges are not fully effective in offsetting changes to the value of the hedged commodity, as well as changes in the fair value of derivatives that do not qualify or have not been designated as hedges under GAAP, must be recorded in our income. This creates the risk of volatility in earnings even if no economic impact to us has occurred during the applicable period.  The impact of changes in market prices for NGLs and natural gas on the average prices paid or received by us may be reduced based on the level of our hedging activities. These hedging arrangements may limit or enhance our margins if the market prices for NGLs or natural gas were to change substantially from the price established by the hedges. In addition, our hedging arrangements expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including instances in which:         •    Volumes are less than expected;         •    The hedging instrument is not perfectly effective in mitigating the risk being hedged;         •    The counterparties to our hedging arrangements fail to honor their financial commitments.  The adoption and implementation of new statutory and regulatory requirements for derivative transactions could have an adverse impact on our ability to hedge risks associated with our business and increase the working capital requirements to conduct these activities.  In July 2010, federal legislation known as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Act) was enacted. The Act provides for new statutory and regulatory requirements for derivative transactions, including oil and gas hedging transactions. Among other things, the Act provides for the creation of position limits for certain derivatives transactions, as well as requiring certain transactions to be cleared on exchanges for which cash collateral will be required. The final impact of the Act on our hedging activities is uncertain at this time due to the requirement that the SEC and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) promulgate rules and regulations implementing the new legislation within 360 days from the date of enactment. These new rules and regulations could significantly increase the cost of derivative contracts, materially alter the terms of derivative contracts or reduce the availability of derivatives. Although we believe the derivative contracts that we enter into should not be impacted by position limits and should be exempt from the requirement to clear transactions through a central exchange or to post collateral, the impact upon our businesses will depend on the outcome of the implementing regulations adopted by the CFTC.  Depending on the rules and definitions adopted by the CFTC or similar rules that may be adopted by other regulatory bodies, we might in the future be required to provide cash collateral for our commodities hedging transactions under circumstances in which we do not currently post cash collateral. Posting of such additional cash collateral could impact liquidity and reduce our cash available for capital expenditures. A requirement to post cash collateral could therefore reduce our ability to execute hedges to reduce commodity price uncertainty and thus protect cash flows. If we reduce our use of derivatives as a result of the Act and regulations, our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable.  We depend on certain key customers for a significant portion of our revenues. The loss of any of these key customers or the loss of any contracted volumes could result in a decline in our business.  Our gas pipeline and midstream businesses rely on a limited number of customers for a significant portion of their revenues. Although some of these customers are subject to long-term contracts, extensions or replacements of these contracts may not be renegotiated on favorable terms, if at all. The loss of all, or even a portion of the revenues from natural gas, NGLs or contracted volumes, as applicable, supplied by these customers, as a result of competition, creditworthiness, inability to negotiate extensions or replacements of contracts or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows, unless we are able to acquire comparable volumes from other sources.    27    We are exposed to the credit risk of our customers and counterparties, and our credit risk management may not be adequate to protect against such risk.  We are subject to the risk of loss resulting from nonpayment and/or nonperformance by our customers and counterparties in the ordinary course of our business. Generally, our customers are rated investment grade, are otherwise considered creditworthy or are required to make prepayments or provide security to satisfy credit concerns. However, our credit procedures and policies may not be adequate to fully eliminate customer and counterparty credit risk. We cannot predict to what extent our business would be impacted by deteriorating conditions in the economy, including declines in our customers’ and counterparties’ creditworthiness. If we fail to adequately assess the creditworthiness of existing or future customers and counterparties, unanticipated deterioration in their creditworthiness and any resulting increase in nonpayment and/or nonperformance by them could cause us to write-down or write-off doubtful accounts. Such write-downs or write-offs could negatively affect our operating results in the periods in which they occur, and, if significant, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.  Our industry is highly competitive, and increased competitive pressure could adversely affect our business and operating results.  We have numerous competitors in all aspects of our businesses, and additional competitors may enter our markets. Other companies with which we compete may be able to respond more quickly to new laws or regulations or emerging technologies, or to devote greater resources to the construction, expansion or refurbishment of their facilities than we can. In addition, current or potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or have greater financial resources than we do, which could affect our ability to make investments or acquisitions. Similarly, a highly-liquid competitive commodity market in natural gas and increasingly competitive markets for natural gas services, including competitive secondary markets in pipeline capacity, have developed. As a result, pipeline capacity is being used more efficiently, and peaking and storage services are increasingly effective substitutes for annual pipeline capacity. We may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors and any failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.  Our operations are subject to operational hazards and unforeseen interruptions for which they may not be adequately insured.  There are operational risks associated with gathering, transporting, storage, processing and treating of natural gas and the fractionation and storage of NGLs, including:         •    Hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, fires, extreme weather conditions, and other natural disasters;         •    Aging infrastructure and mechanical problems;         •    Damages to pipelines and pipeline blockages or other pipeline interruptions;         •    Uncontrolled releases of natural gas (including sour gas), NGLs, brine or industrial chemicals;         •    Collapse or failure of storage caverns;         •    Operator error;         •    Damage caused by third-party activity, such as operation of construction equipment;         •    Pollution and other environmental risks;         •    Fires, explosions, craterings and blowouts;         •    Risks related to truck and rail loading and unloading;         •    Risks related to operating in a marine environment;         •    Terrorist attacks or threatened attacks on our facilities or those of other energy companies.    28    Any of these risks could result in loss of human life, personal injuries, significant damage to property, environmental pollution, impairment of our operations and substantial losses to us. In accordance with customary industry practice, we maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these risks and losses, and only at levels we believe to be appropriate. The location of certain segments of our facilities in or near populated areas, including residential areas, commercial business centers and industrial sites, could increase the level of damages resulting from these risks. In spite of our precautions, an event such as those described above could cause considerable harm to people or property, and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, particularly if the event is not fully covered by insurance. Accidents or other operating risks could further result in loss of service available to our customers.  Our costs of testing, maintaining or repairing our facilities may exceed our expectations and the FERC or competition in our markets may not allow us to recover such costs in the rates we charge for our services.  We have experienced unexpected leaks or ruptures on one of our gas pipeline systems, including a rupture near Appomattox, Virginia in 2008 and a rupture near Sweet Water, Alabama in 2011. We could experience additional unexpected leaks or ruptures on our gas pipeline systems, or be required by regulatory authorities to test or undertake modifications to our systems that could result in a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations if the costs of testing, maintaining or repairing our facilities exceed current expectations and the FERC or competition in our markets do not allow us to recover such costs in the rates we charge for our service. For example, in response to a recent third-party pipeline rupture, PHMSA issued an Advisory Bulletin which, among other things, advises pipeline operators that if they are relying on design, construction, inspection, testing, or other data to determine the pressures at which their pipelines should operate, the records of that data must be traceable, verifiable and complete. More recently, the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Job Creation Act of 2011 became law and under this statute PHMSA may issue additional regulations addressing such records. Locating such records and, in the absence of any such records, verifying maximum pressures through physical testing or modifying or replacing facilities to meet the demands of such pressures, could significantly increase our costs. Additionally, failure to locate such records or verify maximum pressures could result in reductions of allowable operating pressures, which would reduce available capacity on our pipelines.  We do not insure against all potential losses and could be seriously harmed by unexpected liabilities or by the inability of our insurers to satisfy our claims.  We are not fully insured against all risks inherent to our business, including environmental accidents. We do not maintain insurance in the type and amount to cover all possible risks of loss. We currently maintain excess liability insurance with limits of $610 million per occurrence and in the annual aggregate with $2 million per occurrence deductible. This insurance covers us, our subsidiaries, and certain of our affiliates for legal and contractual liabilities arising out of bodily injury or property damage, including resulting loss of use to third parties. This excess liability insurance includes coverage for sudden and accidental pollution liability for full limits, with the first $135 million of insurance also providing gradual pollution liability coverage for natural gas and NGL operations. Although we maintain property insurance on certain physical assets that we own, lease or are responsible to insure, the policy may not cover the full replacement cost of all damaged assets or the entire amount of business interruption loss we may experience. In addition, certain perils may be excluded from coverage or sub-limited. We may not be able to maintain or obtain insurance of the type and amount we desire at reasonable rates. We may elect to self insure a portion of our risks. We do not insure our onshore underground pipelines for physical damage, except at certain locations such as river crossings and compressor stations. Offshore assets are covered for property damage when loss is due to a named windstorm event and coverage for loss caused by a named windstorm is significantly sub-limited and subject to a large deductible. All of our insurance is subject to deductibles. If a significant accident or event occurs for which we are not fully insured it could adversely affect our operations and financial condition.    29    In addition, to the insurance coverage described above, we are a member of Oil Insurance Limited (OIL), an energy industry mutual insurance company, which provides coverage for damage to our property. As an insured of OIL, we share in the losses among other OIL members even if our property is not damaged.  Furthermore, any insurance company that provides coverage to us may experience negative developments that could impair their ability to pay any of our claims. As a result, we could be exposed to greater losses than anticipated and may have to obtain replacement insurance, if available, at a greater cost.  The occurrence of any risks not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and our ability to repay our debt.  Execution of our capital projects subjects us to construction risks, increases in labor costs and materials, and other risks that may adversely affect financial results.  The growth in our gas pipeline and midstream businesses may be dependent upon the construction of new natural gas gathering, transportation, compression, processing or treating pipelines and facilities or natural gas liquids fractionation or storage facilities, as well as the expansion of existing facilities. Construction or expansion of these facilities is subject to various regulatory, development and operational risks, including:         •    The ability to obtain necessary approvals and permits by regulatory agencies on a timely basis and on acceptable terms;         •    The availability of skilled labor, equipment, and materials to complete expansion projects;         •    Potential changes in federal, state and local statutes and regulations, including environmental requirements, that prevent a project from proceeding or increase the anticipated cost of the project;         •    Impediments on our ability to acquire rights-of-way or land rights on a timely basis and on acceptable terms;         •    The ability to construct projects within estimated costs, including the risk of cost overruns resulting from inflation or increased costs of equipment, materials, labor, or other factors beyond our control, that may be material;         •    The ability to access capital markets to fund construction projects.  Any of these risks could prevent a project from proceeding, delay its completion or increase its anticipated costs. As a result, new facilities may not achieve expected investment return, which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.  Our costs and funding obligations for our defined benefit pension plans and costs for our other postretirement benefit plans are affected by factors beyond our control.  We have defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all of our U.S. employees and other post-retirement benefit plans covering certain eligible participants. The timing and amount of our funding requirements under the defined benefit pension plans depend upon a number of factors we control, including changes to pension plan benefits, as well as factors outside of our control, such as asset returns, interest rates and changes in pension laws. Changes to these and other factors that can significantly increase our funding requirements could have a significant adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.  One of our subsidiaries acts as the general partner of a publicly traded limited partnership, Williams Partners L.P. As such, this subsidiary’s operations may involve a greater risk of liability than ordinary business operations.  One of our subsidiaries acts as the general partner of WPZ, a publicly traded limited partnership. This subsidiary may be deemed to have undertaken fiduciary obligations with respect to WPZ as the general partner and to the limited partners of WPZ. Activities determined to involve fiduciary obligations to other persons or entities typically involve a higher standard of conduct than ordinary business operations and therefore may    30     involve a greater risk of liability, particularly when a conflict of interests is found to exist. Our control of the general partner of WPZ may increase the possibility of claims of breach of fiduciary duties, including claims brought due to conflicts of interest (including conflicts of interest that may arise between WPZ, on the one hand, and its general partner and that general partner’s affiliates, including us, on the other hand). Any liability resulting from such claims could be material.  Potential changes in accounting standards might cause us to revise our financial results and disclosures in the future, which might change the way analysts measure our business or financial performance.  Regulators and legislators continue to take a renewed look at accounting practices, financial disclosures, and companies’ relationships with their independent public accounting firms. It remains unclear what new laws or regulations will be adopted, and we cannot predict the ultimate impact that any such new laws or regulations could have. In addition, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the SEC or FERC could enact new accounting standards or FERC could issue rules that might impact how we are required to record revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities and equity. Any significant change in accounting standards or disclosure requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.  Our investments and projects located outside of the United States expose us to risks related to the laws of other countries, and the taxes, economic conditions, fluctuations in currency rates, political conditions and policies of foreign governments. These risks might delay or reduce our realization of value from our international projects.  We currently own and might acquire and/or dispose of material energy-related investments and projects outside the United States. The economic, political and legal conditions and regulatory environment in the countries in which we have interests or in which we might pursue acquisition or investment opportunities present risks that are different from or greater than those in the United States. These risks include delays in construction and interruption of business, as well as risks of war, expropriation, nationalization, renegotiation, trade sanctions or nullification of existing contracts and changes in law or tax policy, including with respect to the prices we realize for the commodities we produce and sell. The uncertainty of the legal environment in certain foreign countries in which we develop or acquire projects or make investments could make it more difficult to obtain nonrecourse project financing or other financing on suitable terms, could adversely affect the ability of certain customers to honor their obligations with respect to such projects or investments and could impair our ability to enforce our rights under agreements relating to such projects or investments.  Operations and investments in foreign countries also can present currency exchange rate and convertibility, inflation and repatriation risk. In certain situations under which we develop or acquire projects or make investments, economic and monetary conditions and other factors could affect our ability to convert to U.S. dollars our earnings denominated in foreign currencies. In addition, risk from fluctuations in currency exchange rates can arise when our foreign subsidiaries expend or borrow funds in one type of currency, but receive revenue in another. In such cases, an adverse change in exchange rates can reduce our ability to meet expenses, including debt service obligations. We may or may not put contracts in place designed to mitigate our foreign currency exchange risks. We have some exposures that are not hedged and which could result in losses or volatility in our results of operations.  Our operating results for certain components of our business might fluctuate on a seasonal and quarterly basis.  Revenues from certain components of our business can have seasonal characteristics. In many parts of the country, demand for natural gas and other fuels peaks during the winter. As a result, our overall operating results in the future might fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis. Demand for natural gas and other fuels could vary significantly from our expectations depending on the nature and location of our facilities and pipeline systems and the terms of our natural gas transportation arrangements relative to demand created by unusual weather patterns.    31    We do not own all of the land on which our pipelines and facilities are located, which could disrupt our operations.  We do not own all of the land on which our pipelines and facilities have been constructed. As such, we are subject to the possibility of increased costs to retain necessary land use. In those instances in which we do not own the land on which our facilities are located, we obtain the rights to construct and operate our pipelines and gathering systems on land owned by third parties and governmental agencies for a specific period of time. In addition, some of our facilities cross Native American lands pursuant to rights-of-way of limited term. We may not have the right of eminent domain over land owned by Native American tribes. Our loss of these rights, through our inability to renew right-of-way contracts or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition and cash flows.  Risks Related to Strategy and Financing  Our debt agreements impose restrictions on us that may limit our access to credit and adversely affect our ability to operate our business.  Certain of our debt agreements contain various covenants that restrict or limit, among other things, our ability and our material subsidiaries ability to grant certain liens to support indebtedness, our ability to merge or consolidate or sell all or substantially all of our assets, enter into certain affiliate transactions, make certain distributions during the continuation of an event of default, and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur additional debt. In addition, our debt agreements contain, and those we enter into in the future may contain, financial covenants and other limitations with which we will need to comply. These covenants could adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs or engage in, expand or pursue our business activities and prevent us from engaging in certain transactions that might otherwise be considered beneficial to us. Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. If market or other economic conditions deteriorate, our current assumptions about future economic conditions turn out to be incorrect or unexpected events occur, our ability to comply with these covenants may be significantly impaired.  Our failure to comply with the covenants in our debt agreements could result in events of default. Upon the occurrence of such an event of default, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under a particular facility to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments, if any, to extend further credit. Certain payment defaults or an acceleration under one debt agreement could cause a cross-default or cross-acceleration of another debt agreement. Such a cross-default or cross-acceleration could have a wider impact on our liquidity than might otherwise arise from a default or acceleration of a single debt instrument. If an event of default occurs, or if other debt agreements cross-default, and the lenders under the affected debt agreements accelerate the maturity of any loans or other debt outstanding to us, we may not have sufficient liquidity to repay amounts outstanding under such debt agreements. For more information regarding our debt agreements, please read “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Liquidity.”  Our ability to repay, extend or refinance our existing debt obligations and to obtain future credit will depend primarily on our operating performance, which will be affected by general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. Our ability to refinance existing debt obligations or obtain future credit will also depend upon the current conditions in the credit markets and the availability of credit generally. If we are unable to meet our debt service obligations or obtain future credit on favorable terms, if at all, we could be forced to restructure or refinance our indebtedness, seek additional equity capital or sell assets. We may be unable to obtain financing or sell assets on satisfactory terms, or at all.    32    Our cash flow depends heavily on the earnings and distributions of WPZ  Our partnership interest in WPZ is one of our largest cash-generating assets. Therefore, our cash flow is heavily dependent upon the ability of WPZ to make distributions to its partners. A significant decline in WPZ’s earnings and/or distributions would have a corresponding negative impact on us.  Difficult conditions in the global capital markets, the credit markets and the economy in general could negatively affect our business and results of operations.  Our businesses may be negatively impacted by adverse economic conditions or future disruptions in global financial markets. Included among these potential negative impacts are reduced energy demand and lower prices for our products and services, increased difficulty in collecting amounts owed to us by our customers and a reduction in our credit ratings (either due to tighter rating standards or the negative impacts described above), which could reduce our access to credit markets, raise the cost of such access or require us to provide additional collateral to our counterparties. If financing is not available when needed, or is available only on unfavorable terms, we may be unable to implement our business plans or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures.  A downgrade of our credit ratings could impact our liquidity, access to capital and our costs of doing business, and independent third parties outside our control determine our credit ratings.  A downgrade of our credit ratings might increase our cost of borrowing and could require us to post collateral with third parties, negatively impacting our available liquidity. Our ability to access capital markets could also be limited by a downgrade of our credit ratings and other disruptions. Such disruptions could include:         •    Economic downturns;         •    Deteriorating capital market conditions;         •    Declining market prices for natural gas, NGLs, oil and other commodities;         •    Terrorist attacks or threatened attacks on our facilities or those of other energy companies;         •    The overall health of the energy industry, including the bankruptcy or insolvency of other companies.  Credit rating agencies perform independent analysis when assigning credit ratings. The analysis includes a number of criteria including, but not limited to, business composition, market and operational risks, as well as various financial tests. Credit rating agencies continue to review the criteria for industry sectors and various debt ratings and may make changes to those criteria from time to time. Credit ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold investments in the rated entity. Ratings are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the ratings agencies, and no assurance can be given that we will maintain our current credit ratings or that our senior unsecured debt rating will be raised to investment grade by all of the credit rating agencies.  Our acquisition attempts may not be successful or may result in completed acquisitions that do not perform as anticipated.  We have made and may continue to make acquisitions of businesses and properties. However, suitable acquisition candidates may not continue to be available on terms and conditions we find acceptable. The following are some of the risks associated with acquisitions, including any completed or future acquisitions:         •    Some of the acquired businesses or properties may not produce revenues, earnings or cash flow at anticipated levels or could have environmental, permitting or other problems for which contractual protections prove inadequate;         •    We may assume liabilities that were not disclosed to us or that exceed our estimates;         •    We may be unable to integrate acquired businesses successfully and realize anticipated economic, operational and other benefits in a timely manner, which could result in substantial costs and delays or other operationally, technical or financial problems;         •    Acquisitions could disrupt our ongoing business, distract management, divert resources and make it difficult to maintain our current business standards, controls and procedures.    33    Risks Related to Regulations that Affect Our Industry  Our gas pipelines could be subject to penalties and fines if they fail to comply with laws governing our businesses.  Our gas pipeline’s transportation and storage operations are regulated by numerous governmental agencies including the FERC, the EPA and PHMSA. Should our gas pipelines fail to comply with all applicable statutes, rules, regulations and orders, they could be subject to substantial penalties and fines. Under the Energy Policy Act of 2005, FERC has civil penalty authority under the NGA to impose penalties for current violations of up to $1,000,000 per day for each violation and under the recently enacted Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Job Creation Act of 2011, PHMSA has civil penalty authority up to $200,000 per day (from the prior $100,000), with a maximum of $2 million for any related series of violations (from the prior $1 million). Any material penalties or fines under these or other statutes, rules, regulations or orders could have a material adverse impact on our gas pipeline business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  The natural gas sales, transportation and storage operations of our gas pipelines are subject to regulation by the FERC, which could have an adverse impact on their ability to establish transportation and storage rates that would allow them to recover the full cost of operating their respective pipelines, including a reasonable rate of return.  The natural gas sales, transmission and storage operations of the gas pipelines are subject to federal, state and local regulatory authorities. Specifically, their interstate pipeline transportation and storage service is subject to regulation by the FERC. The federal regulation extends to such matters as:         •    Transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce;         •    Rates, operating terms, and conditions of service, including initiation and discontinuation of service;         •    The types of services the gas pipelines may offer their customers;         •    Certification and construction of new interstate pipelines and storage facilities;         •    Acquisition, extension, disposition or abandonment of existing interstate pipelines and storage facilities;         •    Accounts and records;         •    Depreciation and amortization policies;         •    Relationships with affiliated companies who are involved in marketing functions of the natural gas business;         •    Market manipulation in connection with interstate sales, purchases or transportation of natural gas.  Under the NGA, FERC has authority to regulate providers of natural gas pipeline transportation and storage services in interstate commerce, and such providers may only charge rates that have been determined to be just and reasonable by FERC. In addition, FERC prohibits providers from unduly preferring or unreasonably discriminating against any person with respect to pipeline rates or terms and conditions of service.  Regulatory actions in these areas can affect our business in many ways, including decreasing tariff rates and revenues, decreasing volumes in our pipelines, increasing our costs and otherwise altering the profitability of our pipeline business.  Unlike other interstate pipelines that own facilities in the offshore Gulf of Mexico, Transco charges its transportation customers a separate fee to access its offshore facilities. The separate charge is referred to as an “IT feeder” charge. The “IT feeder” rate is charged only when gas is actually transported on the facilities and typically it is paid by producers or marketers. Because the “IT feeder” rate is typically paid by producers and marketers, it generally results in netback prices to producers that are slightly lower than the netbacks realized by producers transporting on other interstate pipelines. This rate design disparity can result in producers bypassing Transco’s offshore facilities in favor of alternative transportation facilities.    34    The rates, terms and conditions for interstate gas pipeline services are set forth in FERC-approved tariffs. Any successful complaint or protest against the rates of the gas pipelines could have an adverse impact on their revenues associated with providing transportation services. In addition, there is a risk that rates set by FERC in future rate cases filed by the gas pipelines will be inadequate to recover increases in operating costs or to sustain an adequate return on capital investments. There is also the risk that higher rates would cause their customers to look for alternative ways to transport natural gas.  We are subject to risks associated with climate change.  There is a growing belief that emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) may be linked to climate change. Climate change and the costs that may be associated with its impacts and the regulation of GHGs have the potential to affect our business in many ways, including negatively impacting the costs we incur in providing our products and services, the demand for and consumption of our products and services (due to change in both costs and weather patterns), and the economic health of the regions in which we operate, all of which can create financial risks.  In addition, legislative and regulatory responses related to GHGs and climate change create the potential for financial risk. The U.S. Congress and certain states have for some time been considering various forms of legislation related to GHG emissions. There have also been international efforts seeking legally binding reductions in emissions of GHGs. In addition, increased public awareness and concern may result in more state, regional and/or federal requirements to reduce or mitigate GHG emissions.  Numerous states and other jurisdictions have announced or adopted programs to stabilize and reduce GHGs. In 2009, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a final determination that six GHGs are a threat to public safety and welfare. In 2011, the EPA implemented permitting for new and/or modified large sources of GHG emissions through the existing Prevention of Signification Deterioration permitting program. Additional direct regulation of GHG emissions in our industry may be implemented under other Clean Air Act programs, including the New Source Performance Standards program.  The recent actions of the EPA and the passage of any federal or state climate change laws or regulations could result in increased costs to (i) operate and maintain our facilities, (ii) install new emission controls on our facilities, and (iii) administer and manage any GHG emissions program. If we are unable to recover or pass through a significant level of our costs related to complying with climate change regulatory requirements imposed on us, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. To the extent financial markets view climate change and GHG emissions as a financial risk, this could negatively impact our cost of and access to capital. Legislation or regulations that may be adopted to address climate change could also affect the markets for our products by making our products more or less desirable than competing sources of energy.  Our operations are subject to governmental laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, which may expose us to significant costs, liabilities and expenditures and could exceed current expectations.  Substantial costs, liabilities, delays and other significant issues related to environmental laws and regulations are inherent in the gathering, transportation, storage, processing and treating of natural gas and fractionation of NGLs, and as a result, we may be required to make substantial expenditures that could exceed current expectations. Our operations are subject to extensive federal, state, Native American, and local laws and regulations governing environmental protection, the discharge of materials into the environment and the security of chemical and industrial facilities. These laws include:         •    Clean Air Act (CAA), and analogous state laws, which impose obligations related to air emissions;         •    Clean Water Act (CWA), and analogous state laws, which regulate discharge of wastewaters and storm water from our facilities to state and federal waters, including wetlands;    35         •    Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), and analogous state laws, which regulate the cleanup of hazardous substances that may have been released at properties currently or previously owned or operated by us or locations to which we have sent wastes for disposal;         •    Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), and analogous state laws, which impose requirements for the handling and discharge of solid and hazardous waste from our facilities.         •    Endangered Species Act (ESA), and analogous state laws, which seek to ensure that activities do not jeopardize endangered or threatened animals, fish and plant species, nor destroy or modify the critical habitat of such species;         •    Oil Pollution Act (OPA) of 1990, which requires oil storage facilities and vessels to submit plans to the federal government detailing how they will respond to large discharges, regulates petroleum storage tanks and related equipment, and imposes liability for spills by responsible parties.  Various governmental authorities, including the EPA, the U.S. Department of the Interior, the Bureau of Indian Affairs and analogous state agencies and tribal governments, have the power to enforce compliance with these laws and regulations and the permits issued under them, oftentimes requiring difficult and costly actions. Failure to comply with these laws, regulations, and permits may result in the assessment of administrative, civil, and criminal penalties, the imposition of remedial obligations, the imposition of stricter conditions on or revocation of permits, and the issuance of injunctions limiting or preventing some or all of our operations, delays in granting permits and cancellation of leases.  There is inherent risk of the incurrence of environmental costs and liabilities in our business, some of which may be material, due to our handling of the products as they are gathered, transported, processed, fractionated and stored, air emissions related to our operations, historical industry operations, and waste and waste disposal practices, and the prior use of flow meters containing mercury. Joint and several, strict liability may be incurred without regard to fault under certain environmental laws and regulations, including CERCLA, RCRA, and analogous state laws, for the remediation of contaminated areas and in connection with spills or releases of materials associated with natural gas, oil and wastes on, under, or from our properties and facilities. Private parties, including the owners of properties through which our pipeline and gathering systems pass and facilities where our wastes are taken for reclamation or disposal, may have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance as well as to seek damages for non-compliance with environmental laws and regulations or for personal injury or property damage arising from our operations. Some sites at which we operate are located near current or former third-party hydrocarbon storage and processing or oil and natural gas operations or facilities, and there is a risk that contamination has migrated from those sites to ours. In addition, increasingly strict laws, regulations and enforcement policies could materially increase our compliance costs and the cost of any remediation that may become necessary. Our insurance may not cover all environmental risks and costs or may not provide sufficient coverage if an environmental claim is made against us.  In March 2010, the EPA announced its National Enforcement Initiatives for 2011 to 2013, which includes the addition of “Energy Extraction Activities” to its enforcement priorities list. To address its concerns regarding the pollution risks raised by new techniques for oil and gas extraction and coal mining, the EPA is developing an initiative to ensure that energy extraction activities are complying with federal environmental requirements. We cannot predict what the results of this initiative would be, or whether federal, state, or local laws or regulations will be enacted in this area. If regulations were imposed related to oil and gas extraction, the volumes of natural gas that we transport could decline and our results of operations could be adversely affected.  Our business may be adversely affected by changed regulations and increased costs due to stricter pollution control requirements or liabilities resulting from noncompliance with required operating or other regulatory permits. Also, we might not be able to obtain or maintain from time to time all required environmental regulatory approvals for our operations. If there is a delay in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approvals, or    36     if we fail to obtain and comply with them, the operation or construction of our facilities could be prevented or become subject to additional costs, resulting in potentially material adverse consequences to our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  We are generally responsible for all liabilities associated with the environmental condition of our facilities and assets, whether acquired or developed, regardless of when the liabilities arose and whether they are known or unknown. In connection with certain acquisitions and divestitures, we could acquire, or be required to provide indemnification against, environmental liabilities that could expose us to material losses, which may not be covered by insurance. In addition, the steps we could be required to take to bring certain facilities into compliance could be prohibitively expensive, and we might be required to shut down, divest or alter the operation of those facilities, which might cause us to incur losses.  Hydraulic fracturing is exempt from federal regulation pursuant to the federal Safe Drinking Water Act (except when the fracturing fluids or propping agents contain diesel fuels). However, public concerns have been raised related to its potential environmental impact. Additional federal, state and local laws and regulations to more closely regulate hydraulic fracturing have been considered or implemented. Legislation to further regulate hydraulic fracturing has been proposed in Congress. The U.S. Department of Interior has announced plans to formalize obligations for disclosure of chemicals associated with hydraulic fracturing on federal lands. The results of a pending EPA investigation by a committee of the House of Representatives and two recent reports by the U.S. Department of Energy’s Shale Gas Subcommittee could lead to further restrictions on hydraulic fracturing. The EPA has proposed regulations under the CAA regarding certain emissions from the hydraulic fracturing of oil and natural gas wells and announced its intention to propose regulations by 2014 under the CWA regarding wastewater discharges from hydraulic fracturing and other gas production. In addition, some state and local authorities have considered or imposed new laws and rules related to hydraulic fracturing, including additional permit requirements, operational restrictions, disclosure obligations and temporary or permanent bans on hydraulic fracturing in certain jurisdictions or in environmentally sensitive areas. We cannot predict whether any additional federal, state or local laws or regulations will be enacted in this area and if so, what their provisions would be. If additional levels of reporting, regulation or permitting moratoria were required or imposed related to hydraulic fracturing, the volumes of natural gas and other products that we transport, gather, process and treat could decline and our results of operations could be adversely affected.  We make assumptions and develop expectations about possible expenditures related to environmental conditions based on current laws and regulations and current interpretations of those laws and regulations. If the interpretation of laws or regulations, or the laws and regulations themselves, change, our assumptions and expectations may also change, and any new capital costs incurred to comply with such changes may not be recoverable under our regulatory rate structure or our customer contracts. In addition, new environmental laws and regulations might adversely affect our products and activities, including fractionation, storage and transportation, as well as waste management and air emissions. For instance, federal and state agencies could impose additional safety requirements, any of which could affect our profitability.  If third-party pipelines and other facilities interconnected to our pipelines and facilities become unavailable to transport natural gas and NGLs or to treat natural gas, our revenues could be adversely affected.  We depend upon third-party pipelines and other facilities that provide delivery options to and from our pipelines and facilities for the benefit of our customers. Because we do not own these third-party pipelines or facilities, their continuing operation is not within our control. If these pipelines or other facilities were to become temporarily or permanently unavailable for any reason, or if throughput were reduced because of testing, line repair, damage to the pipelines or facilities, reduced operating pressures, lack of capacity, increased credit requirements or rates charged by such pipelines or facilities or other causes, we and our customers would have reduced capacity to transport, store or deliver natural gas or NGL products to end use markets or to receive deliveries of mixed NGLs, thereby reducing our revenues. Any temporary or permanent interruption at any key    37     pipeline interconnect or in operations on third-party pipelines or facilities that would cause a material reduction in volumes transported on our pipelines or our gathering systems or processed, fractionated, treated or stored at our facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.  Legal and regulatory proceedings and investigations relating to the energy industry have adversely affected our business and may continue to do so. The operations of our businesses might also be adversely affected by changes in government regulations or in their interpretations or implementation, or the introduction of new laws or regulations applicable to our businesses or customers.  Public and regulatory scrutiny of the energy industry has resulted in increased regulations being either proposed or implemented. Adverse effects may continue as a result of the uncertainty of ongoing inquiries, investigations and court proceedings, or additional inquiries and proceedings by federal or state regulatory agencies or private plaintiffs. In addition, we cannot predict the outcome of any of these inquiries or whether these inquiries will lead to additional legal proceedings against us, civil or criminal fines or penalties, or other regulatory action, including legislation or increased permitting requirements. Current legal proceedings or other matters against us, including environmental matters, suits, regulatory appeals, challenges to our permits by citizen groups and similar matters, might result in adverse decisions against us. The result of such adverse decisions, either individually or in the aggregate, could be material and may not be covered fully or at all by insurance. Such scrutiny has also resulted in various inquiries, investigations and court proceedings in which we are a named defendant. Both the shippers on our pipelines and regulators have rights to challenge the rates we charge under certain circumstances. Any successful challenge could materially affect our results of operations.  In addition, existing regulations might be revised or reinterpreted, new laws, regulations and permitting requirements might be adopted or become applicable to us, our facilities our customers, our vendors or our service providers, and future changes in laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. For example, various legislative and regulatory reforms associated with pipeline safety and integrity have been proposed recently, including the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Job Creation Act of 2011 enacted on January 3, 2012. This law will result in the promulgation of new regulations to be administered by the PHMSA affecting the operations of our gas pipelines including, but not limited to, requirements relating to pipeline inspection, installation of additional valves and other equipment and records verification. These reforms and any future changes in related laws and regulations could significantly increase our costs.  The 2010 drilling moratorium in the Gulf of Mexico and potentially more stringent regulations and permitting requirements on drilling in the Gulf of Mexico could adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and cash flows.  The drilling moratorium in the Gulf of Mexico (in force from May to October 2010) impacted our production handling, gathering and transportation operations through production delays which reduced volumes of natural gas and oil delivered to our platform, pipeline and gathering facilities in 2010. In addition, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement continues to develop more stringent drilling and permitting requirements for producers in the Gulf of Mexico which could cause delays in production or new drilling. A significant decline or delay in production volumes in the Gulf of Mexico could adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and cash flows through reduced production handling activities, gathering and transportation volumes, processing activities or other midstream services.    38    Risks Related to Employees, Outsourcing of Noncore Support Activities, and Technology  Institutional knowledge residing with current employees nearing retirement eligibility or with employees going to WPX as part of the separation of our exploration and production business might not be adequately preserved.  In certain areas of our business, institutional knowledge resides with employees who have many years of service. As these employees reach retirement age, or with the loss of employees as part of the separation of our exploration and production business, we may not be able to replace them with employees of comparable knowledge and experience. In addition, we may not be able to retain or recruit other qualified individuals, and our efforts at knowledge transfer could be inadequate. If knowledge transfer, recruiting and retention efforts are inadequate, access to significant amounts of internal historical knowledge and expertise could become unavailable to us.  Failure of our service providers or disruptions to our outsourcing relationships might negatively impact our ability to conduct our business.  Some studies indicate a high failure rate of outsourcing relationships. A deterioration in the timeliness or quality of the services performed by the outsourcing providers or a failure of all or part of these relationships could lead to loss of institutional knowledge and interruption of services necessary for us to be able to conduct our business. The expiration of such agreements or the transition of services between providers could lead to similar losses of institutional knowledge or disruptions.  Certain of our accounting and information technology services are currently provided by an outsourcing provider from service centers outside of the United States. The economic and political conditions in certain countries from which our outsourcing providers may provide services to us present similar risks of business operations located outside of the United States, including risks of interruption of business, war, expropriation, nationalization, renegotiation, trade sanctions or nullification of existing contracts and changes in law or tax policy, that are greater than in the United States.  Risks Related to Weather, other Natural Phenomena and Business Disruption  Our assets and operations can be adversely affected by weather and other natural phenomena.  Our assets and operations, including those located offshore, can be adversely affected by hurricanes, floods, earthquakes, landslides, tornadoes and other natural phenomena and weather conditions, including extreme temperatures, making it more difficult for us to realize the historic rates of return associated with these assets and operations. Insurance may be inadequate, and in some instances, we have been unable to obtain insurance on commercially reasonable terms, or insurance has not been available at all. A significant disruption in operations or a significant liability for which we were not fully insured could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.  Our customers’ energy needs vary with weather conditions. To the extent weather conditions are affected by climate change or demand is impacted by regulations associated with climate change, customers’ energy use could increase or decrease depending on the duration and magnitude of the changes, leading either to increased investment or decreased revenues.  Acts of terrorism could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  Our assets and the assets of our customers and others may be targets of terrorist activities that could disrupt our business or cause significant harm to our operations, such as full or partial disruption to our ability to produce, process, transport or distribute natural gas, NGLs or other commodities. Acts of terrorism as well as events occurring in response to or in connection with acts of terrorism could cause environmental repercussions that could result in a significant decrease in revenues or significant reconstruction or remediation costs.    39    Our business could be negatively impacted by security threats, including cybersecurity threats, and related disruptions.  We rely on our information technology infrastructure to process, transmit and store electronic information, including information we use to safely operate our assets. While we believe that we maintain appropriate information security policies and protocols, we face cybersecurity and other security threats to our information technology infrastructure, which could include threats to our operational and safety systems that operate our pipeline, plants and assets. We could face unlawful attempts to gain access to our information technology infrastructure, including coordinated attacks from hackers, whether state-sponsored groups, “hacktivists,” or private individuals. The age, operating systems or condition of our current information technology infrastructure and software assets and our ability to maintain and upgrade such assets could affect our ability to resist cybersecurity threats. We could also face attempts to gain access to information related to our assets through attempts to obtain unauthorized access by targeting acts of deception against individuals with legitimate access, physical location or information otherwise known as “social engineering.”  Our information technology infrastructure is critical to the efficient operation of our business and essential to our ability to perform day-to-day operations. Breaches in our information technology infrastructure or physical facilities, or other disruptions, could result in damage to our assets, safety incidents, damage to the environment, potential liability or the loss of contracts, and have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial position and results of operations.
