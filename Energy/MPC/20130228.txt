Business  Overview  Marathon Petroleum Corporation (“MPC”) was incorporated in Delaware on November 9, 2009 in connection with an internal restructuring of Marathon Oil Corporation (“Marathon Oil”). On May 25, 2011, the Marathon Oil board of directors approved the spinoff of its Refining, Marketing & Transportation Business (“RM&T Business”) into an independent, publicly traded company, MPC, through the distribution of MPC common stock to the stockholders of Marathon Oil common stock. In accordance with a separation and distribution agreement between Marathon Oil and MPC, the distribution of MPC common stock was made on June 30, 2011, with Marathon Oil stockholders receiving one share of MPC common stock for every two shares of Marathon Oil common stock held (the “Spinoff”). Following the Spinoff, Marathon Oil retained no ownership interest in MPC, and each company had separate public ownership, boards of directors and management. All subsidiaries and equity method investments not contributed by Marathon Oil to MPC remained with Marathon Oil and, together with Marathon Oil, are referred to as the “Marathon Oil Companies.” On July 1, 2011, our common stock began trading “regular-way” on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the ticker symbol “MPC”.  We are one of the largest independent petroleum product refiners, marketers and transporters in the United States. Our operations consist of three business segments:        •    Refining & Marketing—refines crude oil and other feedstocks at our seven refineries in the Gulf Coast and Midwest regions of the United States (including the recently acquired Galveston Bay refinery), purchases ethanol and refined products for resale and distributes refined products through various means, including barges, terminals and trucks that we own or operate. We sell refined products to wholesale marketing customers domestically and internationally, to buyers on the spot market, to our Speedway business segment and to dealers and jobbers who operate Marathon® retail outlets;        •    Speedway—sells transportation fuels and convenience products in the retail market in the Midwest, primarily through Speedway® convenience stores; and        •    Pipeline Transportation—transports crude oil and other feedstocks to our refineries and other locations, delivers refined products to wholesale and retail market areas and includes the aggregated operations of MPLX LP and MPC’s retained pipeline assets and investments.  See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 11 for operating segment and geographic financial information, which is incorporated herein by reference.  On February 1, 2013, we acquired from BP Products North America Inc. and BP Pipelines (North America) Inc. (collectively, “BP”) the 451,000 barrel per calendar day refinery in Texas City, Texas, three intrastate natural gas liquid pipelines originating at the refinery, an allocation of BP’s Colonial Pipeline Company shipper history, four light product terminals, branded-jobber marketing contract assignments for the supply of approximately 1,200 branded sites and a 1,040 megawatt electric cogeneration facility. We refer to these assets as the “Galveston Bay Refinery and Related Assets”. The operating statistics included in this section do not include these assets. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 26 for additional information on the acquisition of these assets.  In 2012, we formed MPLX LP (“MPLX”), a master limited partnership, to own, operate, develop and acquire pipelines and other midstream assets related to the transportation and storage of crude oil, refined products and other hydrocarbon-based products. On October 31, 2012, MPLX completed its initial public offering of 19,895,000 common units, which represented the sale by us of a 26.4 percent interest in MPLX. We own a 73.6    3    Table of Contents  percent interest in MPLX, including the general partner interest, and we consolidate this entity for financial reporting purposes since we have a controlling financial interest. Headquartered in Findlay, Ohio, MPLX’s initial assets consist of a 51 percent general partner interest in MPLX Pipe Line Holdings LP (“Pipe Line Holdings”), which owns a network of common carrier crude oil and product pipeline systems and associated storage assets in the Midwest and Gulf Coast regions of the United States, and a 100 percent interest in a butane storage cavern in West Virginia. We own the remaining 49 percent limited partner interest in Pipe Line Holdings. The operating statistics in this section include 100 percent of these assets for all time periods presented. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 4 for additional information on MPLX’s initial public offering.  On December 1, 2010, we completed the sale of most of our Minnesota assets. These assets included the 74,000 barrel per calendar day St. Paul Park refinery and associated terminals, 166 convenience stores primarily branded SuperAmerica® (including six stores in Wisconsin) along with the SuperMom’s® bakery (a baked goods and sandwich supply operation) and certain associated trademarks, SuperAmerica Franchising LLC, interests in pipeline assets in Minnesota and associated inventories. We refer to these assets as the “Minnesota Assets.” The operating statistics included in this section reflect the exclusion of these assets, except as otherwise indicated. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 7 for additional information on the disposition of these assets.  Our Competitive Strengths  High Quality Asset Base  We believe we are the largest crude oil refiner in the Midwest and the fourth largest in the United States based on crude oil refining capacity. We own a seven-plant refinery network, including our recently acquired Galveston Bay refinery, with approximately 1.7 million barrels per calendar day (“mmbpcd”) of crude oil throughput capacity. Our refineries process a wide range of crude oils, including heavy and sour crude oils, which can generally be purchased at a discount to sweet crude, and produce transportation fuels such as gasoline and distillates, specialty chemicals and other refined products.    4    Table of Contents Strategic Location  The geographic locations of our refineries and our extensive midstream distribution system provide us with strategic advantages. Located in Petroleum Administration for Defense District (“PADD”) II and PADD III, which consist of states in the Midwest and the Gulf Coast regions of the United States, our refineries have the ability to procure crude oil from a variety of supply sources, including domestic, Canadian and other foreign sources, which provides us with flexibility to optimize crude supply costs. For example, geographic proximity to Canadian crude oil supply sources allows our Midwest refineries to incur lower transportation costs than competitors transporting Canadian crude oil to the Gulf Coast for refining. Our refinery locations and midstream distribution system also allow us to access export markets and to serve a broad range of key end-user markets across the United States quickly and cost-effectively.           *  As of December 31, 2012. Excludes the Galveston Bay Refinery and Related Assets.  Attractive Growth Opportunities through Internal Projects  We believe we have attractive growth opportunities through internal capital projects. In 2012, we completed a $2.2 billion (excluding capitalized interest) heavy oil upgrading and expansion project at our Detroit, Michigan refinery. The project enables the refinery to process additional heavy, sour crude oils, including Canadian bitumen blends, which have traded at a significant discount to light sweet crude oil, and increased the refinery’s total crude oil refining capacity by approximately 14 thousand barrels per calendar day (“mbpcd”) to 120 mbpcd.    5    Table of Contents  We plan to evaluate projects that will extract additional value from this major investment at Detroit. At our Garyville, Louisiana refinery, we have initiated projects that we expect will increase our ultra-low-sulfur diesel (“ULSD”) production and expand our gasoline and distillates export capabilities. We also have projects underway at our Robinson, Illinois refinery to increase distillate yields and at our Catlettsburg, Kentucky refinery to improve gas oil recovery and reduce purchased feedstock volumes, thus reducing our feedstock costs. We are also increasing our capacity to process condensate from the Utica Shale region at our Canton, Ohio and Catlettsburg refineries.  Acquisition of Galveston Bay Refinery and Related Assets  Through our February 1, 2013 acquisition of the Galveston Bay Refinery and Related Assets, we added 451 mbpcd of crude oil refining capacity and have diversified and further balanced our network of refining assets. Our refining capacity is now balanced between three market areas, with 646 mbpcd of capacity in the Midwest, 531 mbpcd in Texas and 522 mbpcd in Louisiana. This acquisition provides us with the opportunity to capture synergies across our existing Gulf Coast operations, increases our refining capacity for specialty chemicals and is anticipated to enhance our ability to sell refined products into export markets.  Extensive Midstream Distribution Networks  We believe the relative scale of our transportation and distribution assets and operations distinguishes us from other refining and marketing companies. We currently own, lease or have ownership interests in approximately 8,300 miles of crude oil and products pipelines, including the approximate 100 miles of natural gas liquid pipelines recently acquired with the Galveston Bay Refinery and Related Assets. Through our ownership interests in MPLX and Pipe Line Holdings, we are one of the largest petroleum pipeline companies in the United States on the basis of total volume delivered. We also own one of the largest private domestic fleets of inland petroleum product barges and one of the largest terminal operations in the United States, as well as trucking and rail assets. We operate this system in coordination with our refining and marketing network, which enables us to optimize feedstock and raw material supplies and refined product distribution, and further allows for important economies of scale across our system.  General Partner and Sponsor of MPLX  Our investment in MPLX provides us an efficient vehicle to invest in organic projects and pursue acquisitions of midstream assets. MPLX’s strong liquidity and borrowing capacity provides us a strong foundation to execute our strategy for growing our midstream logistics business. Our role as the general partner allows us to maintain strategic control of the assets so we can continue to optimize our refinery feedstock and distribution networks.  Competitively Positioned Marketing Operations  We are one of the largest wholesale suppliers of gasoline and distillates to resellers within our market area. We have two strong retail brands: Speedway® and Marathon®. We believe our 1,464 Speedway® convenience stores, which we operate through a wholly owned subsidiary, Speedway LLC, comprise the fourth largest chain of company-owned and operated retail gasoline and convenience stores in the United States. The Marathon brand is an established motor fuel brand in the Midwest and Southeast regions of the United States, and was available through approximately 5,000 retail outlets operated by jobbers and dealers in 17 states as of December 31, 2012. In addition, as part of the acquisition of the Galveston Bay Refinery and Related Assets, we were assigned retail marketing contracts for approximately 1,200 branded retail outlets that we are in the process of converting to the Marathon brand. We believe our distribution system allows us to maximize the sales value of our products and minimize cost.    6    Table of Contents Established Track Record of Profitability and Diversified Income Stream  We have demonstrated an ability to achieve positive financial results throughout all stages of the refining cycle. We believe our business mix and strategies position us well to continue to achieve competitive financial results. As shown in the following chart, income from operations attributable to the Speedway and Pipeline Transportation segments is less sensitive to business cycles while our Refining & Marketing segment enables us to generate significant income and cash flow when market conditions are more favorable.  Marathon Petroleum Corporation  Segment Income from Operations       Strong Financial Position  As of December 31, 2012, we had $4.86 billion in cash and cash equivalents and $3.0 billion in unused committed credit facilities, excluding MPLX’s credit facility. We also had $3.36 billion of debt at year-end, which represented only 22 percent of our total capitalization. This combination of strong liquidity and manageable leverage allows us to fund our growth projects and to pursue our business strategies.  Our Business Strategies  Achieve Top-Tier Safety and Environmental Performance  We remain committed to operating our assets in a safe and reliable manner and targeting continuous improvement in our safety record across all of our operations. We have a history of safe and reliable operations, which was demonstrated with record employee and contractor safety performance across all our operations in 2012, including a world class safety record for the heavy oil upgrading and expansion project at our Detroit refinery. In addition, we remain committed to environmental stewardship by continuing to improve the efficiency of our operations while proactively meeting our regulatory requirements.  Grow Enterprise Value  We intend to grow our share price through a combination of earnings growth and return of capital to shareholders in the form of strong and growing dividends and sustained share repurchases. We have increased our quarterly dividend by 75 percent since becoming a stand-alone company in June 2011 and our board of directors has authorized share repurchases totaling $4.0 billion. We entered into two accelerated share repurchase (“ASR”) programs for a total of $1.35 billion, through which we repurchased approximately 8 percent of our outstanding common shares in 2012. After the effects of these ASR programs, $2.65 billion of the $4.0 billion total authorization is available for future repurchases.    7    Table of Contents Expand Midstream Business through MPLX  We expect there will be significant investment in infrastructure to connect growing North American crude oil production with existing refining assets and to move refined products to wholesale and retail marketing customers. We intend to aggressively participate in this infrastructure build out and MPLX will be the entity through which we expect to grow our midstream business. We intend to increase revenue on the MPLX network of pipeline systems through higher utilization of existing assets, by capitalizing on organic investment opportunities that may arise from the growth of MPC’s operations and from increased third-party activity in MPLX’s areas of operations. Through MPLX, we also plan to pursue acquisitions of midstream assets both within our existing geographic footprint and in new areas.  Deliver Top Quartile Refining Performance  Our refineries are well positioned to benefit from the growing crude oil and condensate production in North America, including the Bakken, Eagle Ford and Utica Shale regions, along with the Canadian oil sands. We are also well positioned to export distillates and other products as the demand continues to grow.  We intend to increase our earnings in the Refining & Marketing segment through organic investments and selective acquisitions, while maintaining financial discipline. For example, we recently completed a $2.2 billion investment (excluding capitalized interest) to upgrade and expand our Detroit refinery. This investment significantly expands our ability to process heavy crude oil at the Detroit refinery from about 20 mbpcd to 100 mbpcd. In February 2013, we closed on the 451 mbpcd Galveston Bay refinery. This acquisition increases our crude oil refining capacity by approximately 36 percent, diversifies the footprint of our refining assets, provides us with the opportunity to increase our export sales, and significantly increases our participation in the chemicals value chain. We will continue to evaluate opportunities to expand our existing asset base, with an emphasis on increasing distillates production and export capabilities.  Increase Assured Sales Volumes at our Marathon Brand and Speedway Locations  We consider assured sales as those sales we make to Marathon brand customers, our Speedway operations and to our wholesale customers with whom we have required minimum volume sales contracts. We believe having assured sales brings ratability to our distribution systems, provides a solid base to enhance our overall supply reliability and allows us to efficiently and effectively optimize our operations between our refineries, our pipelines and our terminals. The Marathon brand has been a consistent vehicle for sales volume growth in existing and contiguous markets. The acquisition of the Galveston Bay Refinery and Related Assets provides us with opportunities to further expand our market presence. Through the assignment of branded-jobber contracts representing approximately 1,200 retail outlets, we are in position to take advantage of opportunities with premier Southeast jobbers and to significantly expand our brand presence in the Southeast. We also intend to grow Speedway gasoline and distillates sales volumes through internal capital program growth projects and acquisitions that complement our existing store network.  Deliver Profitable Speedway Growth  We intend to grow Speedway’s sales and profitability by focusing on continuous improvement of existing operations, organic growth and strategic store acquisition opportunities. For example, the acquisition of 97 convenience stores in 2012 has increased Speedway’s presence in the Midwest. In addition, our industry-leading Speedy Rewards® customer loyalty program, which has over three million members, provides us with a unique competitive advantage and opportunity to increase our Speedway customer base with existing and new Speedway locations.  Utilize and Expand our High Quality Employee Workforce  We plan to utilize our high quality employee workforce by continuing to leverage our commercial skills. In addition, we plan to expand our workforce through selective hiring practices and effective training programs on safety, environmental stewardship and other professional and technical skills.    8    Table of Contents The above discussion contains forward-looking statements with respect to our competitive strengths and business strategies, including our share repurchase program and pursuing potential acquisitions. There can be no assurance that we will be successful, in whole or in part, in pursuing our business strategies, including our share repurchase program or pursuing potential acquisitions. Factors that could affect the share repurchase program and its timing include, but are not limited to, business conditions, availability of liquidity and the market price of our common stock. Factors that could affect pursuing potential acquisitions include, but are not limited to, our ability to implement and realize the benefits and synergies of our strategic initiatives, availability of liquidity, actions taken by competitors, regulatory approvals and operating performance. These factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. For additional information on forward-looking statements and risks that can affect our business, see “Disclosures Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and Item 1A. Risk Factors in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Refining & Marketing  Refineries  As of December 31, 2012, we owned and operated six refineries in the Gulf Coast and Midwest regions of the United States with an aggregate crude oil refining capacity of approximately 1.25 mmbpcd. The acquisition of the Galveston Bay refinery on February 1, 2013 increased our crude oil refining capacity to approximately 1.7 mmbpcd. During 2012, our refineries processed 1,195 thousand barrels per day (“mbpd”) of crude oil and 168 mbpd of other charge and blendstocks. During 2011, our refineries processed 1,177 mbpd of crude oil and 181 mbpd of other charge and blendstocks. The table below sets forth the location, crude oil refining capacity, tank storage capacity and number of tanks for each of our refineries as of December 31, 2012.

Our refineries include crude oil atmospheric and vacuum distillation, fluid catalytic cracking, catalytic reforming, desulfurization and sulfur recovery units. The refineries process a wide variety of crude oils and produce numerous refined products, ranging from transportation fuels, such as reformulated gasolines, blend-grade gasolines intended for blending with fuel ethanol and ULSD fuel, to heavy fuel oil and asphalt. Additionally, we manufacture aromatics, propane, propylene, cumene and sulfur. Our refineries are integrated with each other via pipelines, terminals and barges to maximize operating efficiency. The transportation links that connect our refineries allow the movement of intermediate products between refineries to optimize operations, produce higher margin products and utilize our processing capacity efficiently. For example, naphtha may be moved from Texas City to Robinson where excess reforming capacity is available. Also, by shipping intermediate products between facilities during partial refinery shutdowns, we are able to utilize processing capacity that is not directly affected by the shutdown work.    9    Table of Contents Garyville, Louisiana Refinery. Our Garyville, Louisiana refinery is located along the Mississippi River in southeastern Louisiana between New Orleans and Baton Rouge. The Garyville refinery is configured to process almost any grade of crude oil into products such as gasoline, distillates, fuel-grade coke, asphalt, polymer grade propylene, propane, slurry, isobutane and sulfur. An expansion project was completed in 2009 that increased Garyville’s crude oil refining capacity, making it one of the largest refineries in the U.S. Our Garyville refinery has earned designation as a U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) Voluntary Protection Program (“VPP”) Star site.  Catlettsburg, Kentucky Refinery. Our Catlettsburg, Kentucky refinery is located in northeastern Kentucky on the western bank of the Big Sandy River, near the confluence with the Ohio River. The Catlettsburg refinery processes sweet and sour crude oils into products such as gasoline, distillates, asphalt, heavy fuel oil, cumene, propane, propylene and petrochemicals.  Robinson, Illinois Refinery. Our Robinson, Illinois refinery is located in southeastern Illinois. The Robinson refinery processes sweet and sour crude oils into products such as multiple grades of gasoline, distillates, propane, anode-grade coke and propylene. The Robinson refinery has earned designation as an OSHA VPP Star site.  Detroit, Michigan Refinery. Our Detroit, Michigan refinery is located in southwest Detroit. It is the only petroleum refinery currently operating in Michigan. The Detroit refinery processes light sweet and heavy sour crude oils, including Canadian crude oils, into products such as gasoline, distillates, asphalt, propylene, propane, slurry and fuel-grade coke. Our Detroit refinery earned designation as a Michigan VPP Star site in 2010. In the fourth quarter of 2012, we completed a heavy oil upgrading and expansion project that enables the refinery to process up to an additional 80 mbpd of heavy sour crude oils, including Canadian bitumen blends, and increased its total crude oil refining capacity by approximately 14 mbpcd, to 120 mbpcd.  Canton, Ohio Refinery. Our Canton, Ohio refinery is located approximately 60 miles south of Cleveland, Ohio. The Canton refinery processes sweet and sour crude oils into products such as gasoline, distillates, asphalt, roofing flux, propane and slurry.  Texas City, Texas Refinery. Our Texas City, Texas refinery is located on the Texas Gulf Coast approximately 30 miles southeast of Houston, Texas. The refinery processes light sweet crude oil into products such as gasoline, chemical grade propylene, propane, slurry and aromatics. Our Texas City refinery earned designation as an OSHA VPP Star site in 2012.  As of December 31, 2012, our refineries had 24 rail loading racks and 23 truck loading racks and three of our refineries had a total of seven owned and four non-owned docks. Total throughput in 2012 was 75 mbpd for the refinery loading racks and 499 mbpd for the refinery docks.  Planned maintenance activities, or turnarounds, requiring temporary shutdown of certain refinery operating units, are periodically performed at each refinery. See Item 7.

During 2012, we began transporting crude oil by truck from the Utica Shale region to our Canton refinery. As of December 31, 2012, we owned four transport trucks and seven trailers for this purpose.  Refined Product Marketing  We believe we are one of the largest wholesale suppliers of gasoline and distillates to resellers and consumers within our 17-state market area in the Midwest, Gulf Coast and Southeast regions of the United States. Independent retailers, wholesale customers, our Marathon brand jobbers and Speedway brand convenience stores, airlines, transportation companies and utilities comprise the core of our customer base. In addition, we sell distillates, asphalt and gasoline for export to international customers, primarily out of our Garyville refinery. Sales destined for export comprised approximately 25 percent of our distillate sales and 13 percent of our asphalt sales in 2012.    11    Table of Contents The following table sets forth, as a percentage of total refined product sales volume, the sales of refined products to our different customer types for the past three years (including the Minnesota Assets until December 1, 2010).

We sell gasoline, gasoline blendstocks and distillates (including No. 1 and No. 2 fuel oils, kerosene, jet fuel and diesel fuel) to wholesale customers, Marathon-branded jobbers and dealers and our    12    Table of Contents  Speedway® convenience stores in the Midwest, Gulf Coast and Southeast regions of the United States and on the spot market. In addition, we sell diesel fuel for export to international customers. We sold 57 percent of our gasoline sales volumes and 89 percent of our distillates sales volumes on a wholesale or spot market basis in 2012. The demand for gasoline and distillates is seasonal in many of our markets, with demand typically at its highest levels during the summer months.  We have blended ethanol into gasoline for more than 20 years and began expanding our blending program in 2007, in part due to federal regulations that require us to use specified volumes of renewable fuels. Ethanol volumes sold in blended gasoline (including the Minnesota Assets until December 1, 2010) were 68 mbpd in 2012, 70 mbpd in 2011 and 68 mbpd in 2010. The future expansion or contraction of our ethanol blending program will be driven by the economics of the ethanol supply and by government regulations. We sell reformulated gasoline, which is also blended with ethanol, in parts of our marketing territory, including Kentucky, Illinois, Indiana, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Texas. We also sell biodiesel-blended diesel fuel in Kentucky, West Virginia, Illinois, Ohio, North Carolina, Florida, Virginia, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Minnesota and Tennessee.  We hold a 36 percent interest in an entity that owns and operates a 110-million-gallon-per-year ethanol production facility in Clymers, Indiana. We also own a 50 percent interest in an entity that owns a 110-million-gallon-per-year ethanol production facility in Greenville, Ohio. Both of these facilities are managed by a co-owner.  Propane. We produce propane at all of our refineries. Propane is primarily used for home heating and cooking, as a feedstock within the petrochemical industry, for grain drying and as a fuel for trucks and other vehicles. Our propane sales are typically split evenly between the home heating market and industrial consumers.  Feedstocks and Special Products. We are a producer and marketer of feedstocks and specialty products. Product availability varies by refinery and includes propylene, cumene, molten sulfur, toluene, benzene, xylene and dilute naphthalene oil. We market all products domestically to customers in the chemical, agricultural and fuel blending industries. In addition, we produce fuel-grade coke at our Garyville and Detroit refineries, which is used for power generation and in miscellaneous industrial applications, and anode-grade coke at our Robinson refinery, which is used to make carbon anodes for the aluminum smelting industry.  Heavy Fuel Oil. We produce and market heavy residual fuel oil or related components at all of our refineries. Heavy residual fuel oil is primarily used in the utility and ship bunkering (fuel) industries, though there are other more specialized uses of the product.  Asphalt. We have refinery-based asphalt production capacity of up to 98 mbpcd. We market asphalt through 31 owned or leased terminals throughout the Midwest and Southeast. We have a broad customer base, including asphalt-paving contractors, government entities (states, counties, cities and townships) and asphalt roofing shingle manufacturers. We sell asphalt in the domestic and export wholesale markets via rail, barge and vessel. We also produce asphalt cements, polymer modified asphalt, emulsified asphalt and industrial asphalts.    13    Table of Contents Refined Product Distribution  As of December 31, 2012, we owned and operated 61 light product and 21 asphalt terminals. The acquisition of the Galveston Bay Refinery and Related Assets on February 1, 2013 increased our number of owned and operated light product terminals to 65. Our light product and asphalt terminals averaged 1,278 mbpd and 31 mbpd of throughput in 2012, respectively. In addition, we distribute refined products through one leased light product terminal, two light product terminals in which we have partial ownership interests but do not operate and approximately 61 third-party light product and 10 third-party asphalt terminals in our market area.

As of December 31, 2012, we owned 60 private tanks with storage capacity of approximately 6.5 million barrels, which are located along MPLX pipelines.  Galveston Bay Refinery and Related Assets  As part of the February 1, 2013 acquisition of the Galveston Bay Refinery and Related Assets, we acquired approximately 100 miles of natural gas liquid pipelines consisting of three intrastate systems originating at the Galveston Bay refinery. The pipelines are each eight inches in diameter and have a total capacity of approximately 40 mbpd.  Competition, Market Conditions and Seasonality  The downstream petroleum business is highly competitive, particularly with regard to accessing crude oil and other feedstock supply and the marketing of refined products. We compete with a large number of other companies to acquire crude oil for refinery processing and in the distribution and marketing of a full array of petroleum products. Based upon the “The Oil & Gas Journal 2012 Worldwide Refinery Survey” and our acquisition of the Galveston Bay refinery on February 1, 2013, we ranked fourth among U.S. petroleum companies on the basis of U.S. crude oil refining capacity as of February 1, 2013. We compete in four distinct markets for the sale of refined products—wholesale, spot, branded and retail distribution. We believe we compete with about 60 companies in the sale of refined products to wholesale marketing customers, including private-brand marketers and large commercial and industrial consumers; about 80 companies in the sale of refined products in the spot market; 11 refiners or marketers in the supply of refined products to refiner-branded dealers and jobbers; and approximately 250 retailers in the retail sale of refined products. In addition, we compete with producers and marketers in other industries that supply alternative forms of energy and fuels to satisfy the requirements of our industrial, commercial and individual consumers. We do not produce any of the crude oil we refine.    19    Table of Contents We also face strong competition for sales of retail gasoline, diesel fuel and merchandise. Our competitors include service stations and convenience stores operated by fully integrated major oil companies and their dealers and jobbers and other well-recognized national or regional convenience stores and travel centers, often selling gasoline, diesel fuel and merchandise at aggressively competitive prices. Non-traditional retailers, such as supermarkets, club stores and mass merchants, have affected the convenience store industry with their entrance into the retail transportation fuel business. Energy Analysts International, Inc. estimates such retailers had 12.4 percent of the U.S. gasoline market in 2012. Our pipeline transportation operations are highly regulated, which affects the rates that our common carrier pipelines can charge for transportation services and the return we obtain from such pipelines.  Market conditions in the oil and gas industry are cyclical and subject to global economic and political events and new and changing governmental regulations. Our operating results are affected by price changes in crude oil, natural gas and refined products, as well as changes in competitive conditions in the markets we serve. Price differentials between sweet and sour crude oil also affect our operating results.  Demand for gasoline, diesel fuel and asphalt is higher during the spring and summer months than during the winter months in most of our markets, primarily due to seasonal increases in highway traffic and construction. As a result, the operating results for each of our segments for the first and fourth quarters are generally lower than for those in the second and third quarters of each calendar year.  Environmental Matters  Our management is responsible for ensuring that our operating organizations maintain environmental compliance systems that support and foster our compliance with applicable laws and regulations, and for reviewing our overall performance associated with various environmental compliance programs. We also have a Corporate Emergency Response Team, composed primarily of senior management, which oversees our response to any major environmental or other emergency incident involving us or any of our facilities.  We believe it is likely that the scientific and political attention to issues concerning the extent and causes of climate change will continue, with the potential for further regulations that could affect our operations. Currently, various legislative and regulatory measures to address greenhouse gases are in various phases of review, discussion or implementation. The cost to comply with these laws and regulations cannot be estimated at this time, but could be significant. For additional information, see Item 1A. Risk Factors. We estimate and publicly report greenhouse gas emissions from our operations and products we produce. Additionally, we continuously strive to improve operational and energy efficiencies through resource and energy conservation where practicable and cost effective.  Our operations are also subject to numerous other laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. These environmental laws and regulations include, among others, the Clean Air Act with respect to air emissions, the Clean Water Act with respect to water discharges, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) with respect to solid and hazardous waste treatment, storage and disposal, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”) with respect to releases and remediation of hazardous substances and the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (“OPA-90”) with respect to oil pollution and response. In addition, many states where we operate have similar laws. New laws are being enacted and regulations are being adopted by various regulatory agencies on a continuing basis, and the costs of compliance with any new laws and regulations are very difficult to estimate at this time.  For a discussion of environmental capital expenditures and costs of compliance for air, water, solid waste and remediation, see Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Environmental Matters and Compliance Costs.    20    Table of Contents Air  We are subject to substantial requirements in connection with air emissions from our operations. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) issued an “endangerment finding” in 2009 that greenhouse gas emissions contribute to air pollution that endangers public health and welfare. Related to this endangerment finding, in April 2010, the EPA finalized a greenhouse gas emissions standard for mobile sources (cars and light duty vehicles). The endangerment finding along with the mobile source standard and the EPA’s determination that greenhouse gases are subject to regulation under the Clean Air Act, and the EPA’s so-called “tailoring rule” led to permitting of larger stationary sources of greenhouse gas emissions, including refineries. Legal challenges filed against these EPA actions were overruled by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, but several parties will seek further review by the U.S. Supreme Court. We also expect refinery-specific New Source Performance Standards will be proposed in 2013. Congress may again consider legislation on greenhouse gas emissions or a carbon tax. Private parties have sued utilities and other emitters of greenhouse gas emissions, but we have not been named in any of those lawsuits. Private-party litigation is also pending against federal and certain state governmental entities seeking additional greenhouse gas emission reductions beyond those currently being undertaken. Although there may be an adverse financial impact (including compliance costs, potential permitting delays and potential reduced demand for certain refined products made from crude oil) associated with any legislation, regulation, litigation or other action, the extent and magnitude of that impact cannot be reasonably estimated due to the uncertainty regarding the additional measures and how they will be implemented.  Of particular significance to our refining operations were EPA Mobile Source Air Toxics II (“MSAT II”) regulations that require reduced benzene levels in refined products. We spent approximately $620 million over a four-year period to complete all MSAT II projects, and all units were in operation as of December 31, 2011.  The EPA has reviewed and has revised or will propose to revise the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (“NAAQS”) for criteria air pollutants. The NAAQS are subject to multiple court challenges, making final compliance plans uncertain. The EPA promulgated a revised ozone standard in March 2008 and commenced a multi-year process to develop the implementing rules required by the Clean Air Act. In 2013, the EPA is expected to propose a stricter ozone standard as part of EPA’s periodic review of that standard. Also, in 2010, the EPA adopted new short-term standards for nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide, and in December 2012 issued a more stringent fine particulate matter (PM 2.5) standard. We cannot reasonably estimate the final financial impact of these proposed and revised NAAQS standards until the standards are finalized, individual state implementing rules are established and judicial challenges are resolved.  In December 2012, the EPA signed final reconsideration amendments to the Boiler and Process Heater Maximum Achievable Control Technology (“Boiler MACT”) rule. This rule had been finalized in March 2011 with work practice standards that are applicable to refinery and natural gas fired equipment. While EPA retained the work practice standards for most refinery equipment, we are currently evaluating the financial impact of the Boiler MACT rule as a result of the reconsideration amendments. Further changes to the rule may occur because of potential litigation.  In 2013, the EPA is expected to propose a Refinery Sector Rule. This rule may require various refinery unit modifications, additional controls, lower emission standards and ambient air monitoring. We cannot reasonably estimate the financial impact of this rule until it is proposed and finalized.  Water  We maintain numerous discharge permits as required under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System program of the Clean Water Act and have implemented systems to oversee our compliance efforts. In addition, we are regulated under OPA-90, which among other requirements, requires the owner or operator of a tank vessel or a facility to maintain an emergency plan to respond to releases of oil or hazardous substances. Also, in case of any such release, OPA-90 requires the responsible company to pay resulting removal costs and damages. OPA-90 also    21    Table of Contents  provides for civil penalties and imposes criminal sanctions for violations of its provisions. We have implemented emergency oil response plans for all of our components and facilities covered by OPA-90 and we have established Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasures plans for all facilities subject to such requirements.  Additionally, OPA-90 requires that new tank vessels entering or operating in U.S. waters be double-hulled and that existing tank vessels that are not double-hulled be retrofitted or removed from U.S. service, according to a phase-out schedule. All of the barges used for river transport of our raw materials and refined products meet the double-hulled requirements of OPA-90. We operate facilities at which spills of oil and hazardous substances could occur. Some coastal states in which we operate have passed state laws similar to OPA-90, but with expanded liability provisions, including provisions for cargo owner responsibility as well as ship owner and operator responsibility.  Solid Waste  We continue to seek methods to minimize the generation of hazardous wastes in our operations. RCRA establishes standards for the management of solid and hazardous wastes. Besides affecting waste disposal practices, RCRA also addresses the environmental effects of certain past waste disposal operations, the recycling of wastes and the regulation of underground storage tanks (“USTs”) containing regulated substances. We have ongoing RCRA treatment and disposal operations at one of our facilities and primarily utilize offsite third-party treatment and disposal facilities. Ongoing RCRA-related costs, however, are not expected to be material to our results of operations or cash flows.  Remediation  We own or operate, or have owned or operated, certain retail outlets where, during the normal course of operations, releases of refined products from USTs have occurred. Federal and state laws require that contamination caused by such releases at these sites be assessed and remediated to meet applicable standards. The enforcement of the UST regulations under RCRA has been delegated to the states, which administer their own UST programs. Our obligation to remediate such contamination varies, depending on the extent of the releases and the stringency of the laws and regulations of the states in which we operate. A portion of these remediation costs may be recoverable from the appropriate state UST reimbursement funds once the applicable deductibles have been satisfied. We also have ongoing remediation projects at a number of our current and former refinery, terminal and pipeline locations. Penalties or other sanctions may be imposed for noncompliance.  Claims under CERCLA and similar state acts have been raised with respect to the clean-up of various waste disposal and other sites. CERCLA is intended to facilitate the clean-up of hazardous substances without regard to fault. Potentially responsible parties for each site include present and former owners and operators of, transporters to and generators of the hazardous substances at the site. Liability is strict and can be joint and several. Because of various factors including the difficulty of identifying the responsible parties for any particular site, the complexity of determining the relative liability among them, the uncertainty as to the most desirable remediation techniques and the amount of damages and clean-up costs and the time period during which such costs may be incurred, we are unable to reasonably estimate our ultimate cost of compliance with CERCLA; however, we do not believe such costs will be material to our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.  Mileage Standards, Renewable Fuels and Other Fuels Requirements  In 2007, the U.S. Congress passed the Energy Independence and Security Act (“EISA”), which, among other things, set a target of 35 miles per gallon for the combined fleet of cars and light trucks in the United States by model year 2020, and contains a second Renewable Fuel Standard (the “RFS2”). In August 2012, the EPA and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration jointly adopted regulations that establish average industry    22    Table of Contents  fleet fuel economy standards for passenger cars and light trucks of up to 41 miles per gallon by model year 2021 and average fleet fuel economy standards of up to 49.7 miles per gallon by model year 2025 (the standards from 2022 to 2025 are the government’s current estimate but will require further rulemaking).  The RFS2 requires 16.55 billion gallons of renewable fuel usage in 2013, increasing to 36.0 billion gallons by 2022. In the near term, the RFS2 will be satisfied primarily with fuel ethanol blended into gasoline. The RFS2 presents production and logistic challenges for both the renewable fuels and petroleum refining and marketing industries. The RFS2 has required, and may in the future continue to require, additional capital expenditures or expenses by us to accommodate increased renewable fuels use.  Within the overall 36.0 billion gallon RFS2, EISA established an advanced biofuel RFS2 volume of 2.0 billion gallons in 2012 increasing to 21.0 billion gallons in 2022. Subsets within the advanced biofuel RFS2 include biomass-based diesel, which was set at 1.0 billion gallons in 2012 and at least 1.0 billion gallons in 2013 through 2022 (to be determined by the EPA through future rulemaking), and cellulosic biofuel, which was set at 0.5 billion gallons in 2012, 1.0 billion gallons in 2013, increasing to 16.0 billion gallons by 2022. The EPA established the 2013 biomass-based diesel requirement at 1.28 billion gallons. The EPA determined that 0.5 billion gallons of cellulosic biofuel would not be produced in 2012, and lowered the requirement to 8.65 million gallons. The American Petroleum Institute challenged the EPA 2012 cellulosic biofuel requirement and the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals vacated the requirement finding that it was unlawfully determined and remanded it for further determination. The advanced biofuels programs will present specific challenges in that we may have to enter into arrangements with other parties or purchase credits from the EPA to meet our obligations to use advanced biofuels, including biomass-based diesel and cellulosic biofuel, with potentially uncertain supplies of these new fuels. The advanced requirement for 2012 required a substantial level of Brazilian sugarcane ethanol imports since other sources of advanced renewable fuels were not available. In 2012, the EPA also discovered that 140 million biodiesel Renewable Identification Numbers (“RINs”) used to meet the annual requirement for that fuel had been fraudulently created and sold to unsuspecting third parties, including us.  We made investments in infrastructure capable of expanding biodiesel blending capability to help comply with the biodiesel RFS2 requirement by buying and blending biodiesel into our refined diesel product, and by buying needed biodiesel RINs in the EPA-created biodiesel RINs market.  On October 13, 2010, the EPA issued a partial waiver decision under the Clean Air Act to allow for an increase in the amount of ethanol permitted to be blended into gasoline from 10 percent (“E10”) to 15 percent (“E15”) for 2007 and newer light-duty motor vehicles. On January 21, 2011, the EPA issued a second waiver for the use of E15 in vehicles model year 2001-2006. There are numerous issues, including state and federal regulatory issues, which need to be addressed before E15 can be marketed for use in traditional gasoline engines.  There will be compliance costs and uncertainties regarding how we will comply with the various requirements contained in EISA and related regulations. We may experience a decrease in demand for refined petroleum products due to an increase in combined fleet mileage or due to refined petroleum products being replaced by renewable fuels.  The EPA Tier 3 gasoline rulemaking could potentially lower the allowable sulfur level in gasoline but it may also lower the Reid vapor pressure, and the allowable benzene, aromatics and olefins content of gasoline, while possibly increasing octane requirements. We anticipate a proposed rule will be issued in 2013 and plan to participate in the public comment process.  Trademarks, Patents and Licenses  Our Marathon trademark is material to the conduct of our refining and marketing operations, and our Speedway trademark is material to the conduct of our retail marketing operations. We currently hold a number of U.S. and    23    Table of Contents  foreign patents and have various pending patent applications. Although in the aggregate our patents and licenses are important to us, we do not regard any single patent or license or group of related patents or licenses as critical or essential to our business as a whole. In general, we depend on our technological capabilities and the application of know-how rather than patents and licenses in the conduct of our operations.  Employees  We had approximately 25,985 regular employees as of December 31, 2012, which includes approximately 18,490 employees of Speedway. Approximately 2,025 employees were added in February 2013 associated with the Galveston Bay Refinery and Related Assets.  Certain hourly employees at our Catlettsburg, Canton, Galveston Bay and Texas City refineries are represented by the United Steel, Paper and Forestry, Rubber, Manufacturing, Energy, Allied Industrial and Service Workers Union under labor agreements that are due to expire in 2015.

Risk Factors  You should carefully consider each of the following risks and all of the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K in evaluating us and our common stock. Some of these risks relate principally to our business and the industry in which we operate, while others relate principally to our Spinoff from Marathon Oil, the ownership of our common stock and securities markets generally.  Our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks, and, as a result, the trading price of our common stock could decline.  Risks Relating to Our Industry and Our Business  Failure to identify and manage risks inherent in our industry could adversely impact our business.  Our business requires us to identify and manage the risks inherent to the refining, marketing and transportation business in which we operate. Our operations are subject to business interruption due to scheduled refinery turnarounds and to unplanned maintenance or events such as explosions, fires, refinery or pipeline releases or other incidents, severe weather and labor disputes. Such incidents may result in personal injury, loss of life, environmental damage, legal liability and loss of revenue. Failure to identify and manage these risks could result in explosions, fires, refinery or pipeline releases or other incidents resulting in personal injury, loss of life, environmental damage, property damage, legal liability, loss of revenue and substantial fines by governmental authorities.  A substantial or extended decline in refining and marketing gross margins would reduce our operating results and cash flows and could materially and adversely impact our future rate of growth and the carrying value of our assets.  Our operating results, cash flows, future rate of growth and the carrying value of our assets are highly dependent on the margins we realize on our refined products. The measure of the difference between market prices for refined products and crude oil, or crack spread, is commonly used by the industry as a proxy for refining and marketing gross margins. Historically, refining and marketing gross margins have been volatile and we believe they will continue to be volatile in the future. Our margins and cost of producing gasoline and other refined products are influenced by a number of conditions, including the price of crude oil. We do not produce crude oil and must purchase all of the crude oil we refine. The price of crude oil and the price at which we can sell our refined products may fluctuate independently due to a variety of regional and global market conditions. The overall change in crack spreads will impact our refining and marketing gross margins. Many of the factors influencing the change in crack spreads and refining and marketing gross margins are beyond our control. These factors include:        •    worldwide and domestic supplies of and demand for crude oil and refined products;        •    the cost of crude oil to be manufactured into refined products;        •    the prices realized for refined products;        •    utilization rates of refineries;        •    natural gas and electricity supply costs incurred by refineries;        •    the ability of the members of the OPEC to agree to and maintain production controls;        •    political instability or armed conflict in oil and natural gas producing regions;    27    Table of Contents     •    local weather conditions;        •    seasonality of demand in our marketing area due to increased highway traffic in the spring and summer months;        •    natural disasters such as hurricanes and tornados;        •    the price and availability of alternative and competing forms of energy;        •    domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes; and        •    local, regional, national and worldwide economic conditions.  Some of these factors can vary by region and may change quickly, adding to market volatility, while others may have longer-term effects. The longer-term effects of these and other factors on refining and marketing gross margins are uncertain. We purchase our crude oil and other refinery feedstocks weeks before refining them and selling the refined products. Price level changes during the period between purchasing feedstocks and selling the refined products from these feedstocks could have a significant effect on our financial results. We also purchase refined products manufactured by others for resale to our customers. Price changes during the periods between purchasing and reselling those refined products also could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  Lower refining and marketing gross margins may reduce the amount of refined product we produce, which may reduce our revenues, operating income and cash flows. Significant reductions in refining and marketing gross margins could require us to reduce our capital expenditures or impair the carrying value of our assets.  The availability of crude oil and increases in crude oil prices may reduce profitability and refining and marketing gross margins.  The profitability of our operations depends largely on the difference between the cost of crude oil and other feedstocks we refine and the selling prices we obtain for refined products. A portion of our crude oil is purchased from various foreign national oil companies, producing companies and trading companies, including suppliers from Canada, the Middle East and various other international locations. We are, therefore, subject to the political, geographic and economic risks attendant to doing business with suppliers located in, and supplies originating from, those areas. If one or more of our major supply sources were eliminated, or if political events disrupted our traditional crude oil supply, we believe adequate alternative supplies of crude oil would be available, but it is possible we would be unable to find alternative sources of supply. If we are unable to obtain adequate crude oil volumes or are able to obtain such volumes only at unfavorable prices, our operations, sales of refined products and refining and marketing margins could be adversely affected, materially and adversely impacting our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  Worldwide political and economic developments could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  In addition to impacting crude oil and other feedstock supplies, political and economic factors in global markets could have a material adverse effect on us in other ways. Hostilities in the Middle East or the occurrence or threat of future terrorist attacks could adversely affect the economies of the United States (the “U.S.”) and other developed countries. A lower level of economic activity could result in a decline in energy consumption, which could cause our revenues and margins to decline and limit our future growth prospects. These risks could lead to increased volatility in prices for refined products. Additionally, these risks could increase instability in the    28    Table of Contents  financial and insurance markets and make it more difficult or costly for us to access capital and to obtain the insurance coverage that we consider adequate. Additionally, tax policy, legislative or regulatory action and commercial restrictions could reduce our operating profitability. The U.S. government could prevent or restrict exports of refined products or the conduct of business with certain foreign countries.  Changes in environmental or other laws or regulations may reduce our refining and marketing gross margin and may result in substantial capital expenditures and operating costs that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  Various laws and regulations are expected to impose increasingly stringent and costly requirements on our operations, which may reduce our refining and marketing gross margin. Laws and regulations relating to the emission or discharge of materials into the environment, solid and hazardous waste management, pollution prevention, greenhouse gas emissions and characteristics and composition of gasoline and diesel fuels, as well as those relating to public and employee safety and health and to facility security, in particular, are expected to become more stringent. The specific impact of laws and regulations on us and our competitors may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of operating facilities, marketing areas, crude oil and feedstock sources and production processes. We may be required to make expenditures to modify operations, install pollution control equipment, perform site cleanups or curtail operations that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  We believe the issue of climate change will likely continue to receive scientific and political attention, with the potential for further laws and regulations that could affect our operations. The U.S. pledge in 2009, as part of the Copenhagen Accord, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 17% below 2005 levels by 2020, remains in effect. Meetings of the United Nations Climate Change Conference, however, have produced no legally binding emission reduction requirements on the U.S. Also in 2009, the EPA issued a finding that greenhouse gas emissions contribute to air pollution that endangers public health and welfare. Related to the endangerment finding, in April 2010, the EPA finalized a greenhouse gas emission standard for mobile sources (cars and other light duty vehicles). The endangerment finding, the mobile source standard and the EPA’s determination that greenhouse gases are subject to regulation under the Clean Air Act and the EPA’s so-called “tailoring rule” led to permitting of larger stationary sources of greenhouse gas emissions, including refineries. We also expect refinery-specific New Source Performance Standards will be proposed in 2013. Legal challenges were filed against these EPA actions. The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals overruled these challenges but several parties will seek further review by the U.S. Supreme Court.  In the future, Congress may again consider legislation on greenhouse gas emissions or a carbon tax. Other measures to address greenhouse gas emissions are in various phases of review or implementation in the U.S. These measures include state actions to develop statewide or regional programs to impose emission reductions. Private party litigation is pending against federal and certain state governmental entities seeking additional greenhouse gas emission reductions beyond those currently being undertaken. These actions could result in increased costs to operate and maintain our facilities, capital expenditures to install new emission controls and costs to administer any carbon trading or tax programs implemented. Although uncertain, these developments could increase our costs, reduce the demand for the products we sell and create delays in our obtaining air pollution permits for new or modified facilities.  The EISA, among other things, sets a target of 35 miles per gallon for the combined fleet of cars and light trucks in the U.S. by model year 2020 and contains a second Renewable Fuel Standard commonly referred to as RFS2. In August 2012, the EPA and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration jointly adopted regulations that establish average industry fleet fuel economy standards for passenger cars and light trucks of up to 41 miles per gallon by model year 2021 and of up to 49.7 miles per gallon by model year 2025 (the standards from 2022 to 2025 are the government’s current estimate but will require further rulemaking). Increases in fuel mileage standards and the increased use of renewable fuels (including ethanol and advanced biofuels) may reduce demand for refined products.    29    Table of Contents The RFS2 required the total volume of renewable transportation fuels sold or introduced annually in the U.S. to reach 15.2 billion gallons in 2012 and increases to 36.0 billion gallons by 2022. The RFS2 presents production and logistics challenges for both the renewable fuels and petroleum refining industries, and may continue to require additional capital expenditures or expenses by us to accommodate increased renewable fuels use. The advanced biofuels program, a subset of the RFS2 requirements, creates uncertainties and presents challenges of supply, and may require that we and other refiners and other obligated parties purchase credits from the EPA to meet our obligations.  Tax incentives and other subsidies have also made renewable fuels more competitive with refined products than they otherwise would have been, which may further reduce refined product margins.  The EPA Tier 3 gasoline rulemaking could potentially lower the allowable sulfur level in gasoline, but it may also lower the Reid vapor pressure, and the allowable benzene, aromatics and olefins content of gasoline, while possibly increasing octane requirements. We anticipate a proposed rule will be issued in 2013 and plan to participate in the public comment process.  We have in the past owned or operated, and currently own and operate, convenience stores and other locations with USTs in various states. The operation of USTs poses risks, including soil and groundwater contamination, at our previously or currently operated locations. Such contamination could result in substantial cleanup costs, fines or civil liabilities.  We have in the past and will continue to dispose of various wastes at lawful disposal sites. Environmental laws, including CERCLA, and similar state laws can impose liability for the entire cost of cleanup on any responsible party, without regard to negligence or fault, and impose liability on us for the conduct of others or conditions others have caused, or for our acts that complied with all applicable requirements when performed.  Any failure by us to comply with existing or future laws or regulations could result in the imposition of administrative, civil or criminal penalties, injunctions limiting our operations, investigatory or remedial liabilities or impediments to construction of additional facilities or equipment.  Compliance with and changes in tax laws could materially and adversely impact our financial performance.  We are subject to extensive tax liabilities, including federal and state income taxes and transactional taxes such as excise, sales and use, payroll, franchise, withholding and property taxes. New tax laws and regulations and changes in existing tax laws and regulations could result in increased expenditures by us for tax liabilities in the future and could materially and adversely impact our financial performance. Additionally, many tax liabilities are subject to periodic audits by taxing authorities, and such audits could subject us to interest and penalties.  Competitors that produce their own supply of feedstocks, have more extensive retail outlets or have greater financial resources may have a competitive advantage.  We do not produce any of our crude oil supply. Some of our competitors, however, obtain a significant portion of their crude oil from their own exploration and production activities. Competitors that have their own exploration and production activities may at times be able to offset losses from downstream operations with profits from upstream operations, and may be better positioned to withstand periods of depressed refined product margins or feedstock shortages.  Some of our competitors also have significantly greater financial and other resources than we have. Those competitors may have a greater ability to respond to volatile industry or market conditions, such as shortages of crude oil or other feedstocks or intense price fluctuations.    30    Table of Contents The retail market is diverse and highly competitive, and severe competition could adversely impact our business.  We also face strong competition in the market for the sale of retail gasoline, diesel and merchandise. Our competitors include outlets owned or operated by fully integrated major oil companies or their dealers or jobbers, and other well-recognized national or regional retail outlets, often selling gasoline or merchandise at very competitive prices. Several non-traditional retailers such as supermarkets, club stores and mass merchants are in the retail business. These non-traditional gasoline retailers have obtained a significant share of the transportation fuels market and we expect their market share to grow. Because of their diversity, integration of operations, experienced management and greater resources, these companies may be better able to withstand volatile market conditions or levels of low or no profitability in the retail segment of the market. In addition, these retailers may use promotional pricing or discounts, both at the pump and in the store, to encourage in-store merchandise sales. These activities by our competitors could pressure us to offer similar discounts, adversely affecting our profit margins. Additionally, the loss of market share by our convenience stores to these and other retailers relating to either gasoline or merchandise could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  Our operations are subject to business interruptions and casualty losses. We do not insure against all such potential losses, and, therefore, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by unexpected liabilities and increased costs.  Our operations are subject to business interruption due to scheduled refinery turnarounds and to unplanned events such as explosions, fires, refinery or pipeline releases or other incidents or unplanned maintenance, severe weather and labor disputes. For example, our pipelines provide a nearly-exclusive form of transportation of crude oil to, or refined products from, some of our refineries. In such instances, a prolonged interruption in service of such a pipeline could materially and adversely affect the operations, profitability and cash flows of the connected refinery.  Our operations could result in serious personal injury or loss of human life, significant damage to property and equipment, environmental pollution, impairment of operations and substantial losses to us. Damages resulting from a catastrophic occurrence involving us or any of our assets or operations may result in our being named as a defendant in one or more lawsuits asserting potentially substantial claims or in our being assessed potentially substantial fines by governmental authorities. In addition, our information technology systems and network infrastructure are subject to unauthorized access or attack, which could result in the loss of sensitive business information, systems interruptions or the disruption of our business operations. To protect against such attempts of unauthorized access or attack, we have implemented infrastructure protection technologies and disaster recovery plans. The level of protection and disaster recovery capability varies from site to site, and there can be no guarantee such plans, to the extent they are in place, will be totally effective.  We maintain insurance coverage in amounts we believe to be prudent against many, but not all, potential liabilities arising from operating hazards. Uninsured liabilities arising from operating hazards could reduce the funds available to us for capital and investment spending and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Historically, we also have maintained insurance coverage for physical damage and resulting business interruption to our major facilities, with significant self-insured retentions. In the future, we may not be able to maintain or obtain insurance of the types and amounts we desire at reasonable rates.  As a result of market conditions, premiums and deductibles for certain of our insurance coverage have increased substantially and could escalate further. Certain insurance coverage could become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. For example, due to hurricane activity in recent years, the availability of insurance coverage for our facilities for windstorms in the Gulf of Mexico region has been reduced.    31    Table of Contents We are subject to interruptions of supply and increased costs as a result of our reliance on third-party transportation of crude oil and refined products.  We utilize the services of third parties to transport crude oil and refined products to and from our refineries. In addition to our own operational risks discussed above, we could experience interruptions of supply or increases in costs to deliver refined products to market if the ability of the pipelines or vessels to transport crude oil or refined products is disrupted because of weather events, accidents, governmental regulations or third-party actions. A prolonged disruption of the ability of a pipeline or vessels to transport crude oil or refined product to or from one or more of our refineries could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  If foreign ownership of our stock exceeds certain levels, we could be prohibited from operating inland river vessels, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  The Shipping Act of 1916 and Merchant Marine Act of 1920, which we refer to collectively as the Maritime Laws, generally require that vessels engaged in U.S. coastwise trade be owned by U.S. citizens. Among other requirements to establish citizenship, corporations that own such vessels must be owned at least 75% by U.S. citizens. If we fail to maintain compliance with the Maritime Laws, we would be prohibited from operating vessels in the U.S. inland waters. Such a prohibition could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  We may incur losses to our business as a result of our forward-contract activities and derivative transactions.  We currently use commodity derivative instruments and we expect to enter into these types of transactions in the future. A failure of a futures commission merchant or counterparty to perform would affect these transactions. To the extent the instruments we utilize to manage these exposures are not effective, we may incur losses related to the ineffective portion of the derivative transaction or costs related to moving the derivative positions to another futures commission merchant or counterparty once a failure has occurred.  We have substantial debt obligations, therefore our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be harmed by a deterioration of our credit profile, a decrease in debt capacity or unsecured commercial credit available to us, or by factors adversely affecting credit markets generally.  On February 1, 2011, we completed the offering of senior notes aggregating $3.0 billion in principal amount. At December 31, 2012, our total debt obligations for borrowed money and capital lease obligations was $3.36 billion. We may incur substantial additional debt obligations in the future.  Our indebtedness may impose various restrictions and covenants on us that could have material adverse consequences, including:        •    increasing our vulnerability to changing economic, regulatory and industry conditions;        •    limiting our ability to compete and our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry;        •    limiting our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders;        •    limiting our ability to borrow additional funds; and        •    requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt, thereby reducing funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other purposes.    32    Table of Contents A decrease in our debt and commercial credit capacity, including unsecured credit extended by third-party suppliers, or a deterioration in our credit profile could increase our costs of borrowing money and/or limit our access to the capital markets and commercial credit, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  Historic or current operations could subject us to significant legal liability or restrict our ability to operate.  We currently are defending litigation and anticipate we will be required to defend new litigation in the future. Our operations and those of our predecessors could expose us to litigation and civil claims by private plaintiffs for alleged damages related to contamination of the environment or personal injuries caused by releases of hazardous substances from our facilities, products liability, consumer credit or privacy laws, product pricing or antitrust laws or any other laws or regulations that apply to our operations. While an adverse outcome in most litigation matters would not be expected to be material to us, in class-action litigation large classes of plaintiffs may allege damages relating to extended periods of time or other alleged facts and circumstances that could increase the amount of potential damages. Attorneys general and other government officials may pursue litigation in which they seek to recover civil damages from companies on behalf of a state or its citizens for a variety of claims, including violation of consumer protection and product pricing laws or natural resources damages. We are defending litigation of that type and anticipate that we will be required to defend new litigation of that type in the future. If we are not able to successfully defend such litigation, it may result in liability to our company that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We do not have insurance covering all of these potential liabilities. In addition to substantial liability, plaintiffs in litigation may also seek injunctive relief which, if imposed, could have a material adverse effect on our future business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  A portion of our workforce is unionized, and we may face labor disruptions that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  Approximately 38 percent of our refining employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. The contracts for the hourly refinery workers at our Detroit and Texas City refineries are scheduled to expire in January 2014 and March 2015, respectively. The contracts for the hourly refinery workers at our Canton, Catlettsburg and Galveston Bay refineries are each scheduled to expire in January 2015. These contracts may be renewed at an increased cost to us or we may experience work stoppages as a result of labor disagreements.  One of our subsidiaries acts as the general partner of a publicly traded master limited partnership, MPLX, which may involve a greater exposure to legal liability than our historic business operations.  One of our subsidiaries acts as the general partner of MPLX, a publicly traded master limited partnership. Our control of the general partner of MPLX may increase the possibility of claims of breach of fiduciary duties including claims of conflicts of interest related to MPLX. Any liability resulting from such claims could have a material adverse effect on our future business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  Significant transactions, including the Galveston Bay Refinery and Related Assets acquisition, are subject to substantial risks that could adversely affect our business, financial conditions, results of operations and cash flows.  Any significant transaction, including the Galveston Bay Refinery and Related Assets acquisition, involves potential risks, including, among other things:        •    the validity of our assumptions about future synergies, revenues, capital expenditures and operating costs;        •    an inability to successfully integrate any asset or businesses we acquire;    33    Table of Contents     •    a decrease in our liquidity by using a portion of our available cash or borrowing capacity under our revolving credit agreement to finance transactions;        •    a significant increase in our interest expense or financial leverage if we incur additional debt to finance transactions;        •    the assumption of unknown environmental and other liabilities, losses or costs for which we are not indemnified or for which our indemnity is inadequate;        •    the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns; and        •    the incurrence of other significant charges, such as impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets, asset devaluation or restructuring charges.  Risks Relating to our Spinoff from Marathon Oil  We are subject to certain continuing contingent liabilities of Marathon Oil relating to taxes and other matters and to potential liabilities and temporary limitations pursuant to the tax sharing agreement we entered into with Marathon Oil that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  Although the Spinoff occurred in mid 2011, certain liabilities of Marathon Oil could become our obligations. For example, under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the “Code”) and related rules and regulations, each corporation that was a member of the Marathon Oil consolidated tax reporting group during any taxable period or portion of any taxable period ending on or before the effective time of the Spinoff is jointly and severally liable for the federal income tax liability of the entire Marathon Oil consolidated tax reporting group for that taxable period. In connection with the Spinoff, we entered into a tax sharing agreement with Marathon Oil that allocates the responsibility for prior period taxes of the Marathon Oil consolidated tax reporting group between us and Marathon Oil. However, if Marathon Oil is unable to pay any prior period taxes for which it is responsible, we could be required to pay the entire amount of such taxes. Other provisions of federal law establish similar liability for other matters, including laws governing tax-qualified pension plans as well as other contingent liabilities.  Also pursuant to the tax sharing agreement, following the Spinoff we are responsible generally for all taxes attributable to us or any of our subsidiaries, whether accruing before, on or after the Spinoff. We also agreed to be responsible for, and indemnify Marathon Oil with respect to, all taxes arising as a result of the Spinoff (or certain internal restructuring transactions) failing to qualify as transactions under Sections 368(a) and 355 of the Code for U.S. federal income tax purposes to the extent such tax liability arises as a result of any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other obligation by us or certain affiliates made in connection with the issuance of the private letter ruling relating to the Spinoff or in the tax sharing agreement. In addition, we agreed to indemnify Marathon Oil for specified tax-related liabilities associated with our 2005 acquisition of the minority interest in our refining joint venture from Ashland Inc. Our indemnification obligations to Marathon Oil and its subsidiaries, officers and directors are not limited or subject to any cap. If we are required to indemnify Marathon Oil and its subsidiaries and their respective officers and directors under the tax sharing agreement, we may be subject to substantial liabilities. At this time, we cannot precisely quantify the amount of these liabilities that have been assumed pursuant to the tax sharing agreement and there can be no assurances as to their final amounts. The tax liabilities described in this paragraph could have a material adverse effect on our company.  Under the tax sharing agreement we could be limited for a period of time in our ability to pursue certain strategic or capital raising transactions. In addition, under some circumstances, we could be liable for any adverse tax consequences resulting from engaging in such transactions. Even if the Spinoff’s status as a tax-free distribution under Section 355 of the Code remains intact, the Spinoff may result in significant U.S. federal income tax    34    Table of Contents  liabilities to Marathon Oil under applicable provisions of the Code if 50 percent or more of Marathon Oil’s stock or our stock is treated as having been acquired, directly or indirectly, by one or more persons as part of a plan that includes the Spinoff. Under those provisions, any acquisitions of Marathon Oil stock or our stock (or similar acquisitions), or any understanding, arrangement or substantial negotiations regarding an acquisition of Marathon Oil stock or our stock (or similar acquisitions), within two years before or after the Spinoff are subject to special scrutiny. The process for determining whether an acquisition triggering those provisions has occurred is complex, inherently factual and subject to interpretation of the facts and circumstances of a particular case. If a direct or indirect acquisition of Marathon Oil stock or our stock resulted in a change in control as contemplated by those provisions, Marathon Oil (but not its stockholders) would recognize a taxable gain.  Under the tax sharing agreement, there are also restrictions on our ability to take actions that could cause the separation to fail to qualify as a tax-free distribution, and we are required to indemnify Marathon Oil against any such tax liabilities attributable to actions taken by or with respect to us or any of our affiliates, or any person that, after the Spinoff, is our affiliate. We may be similarly liable if we breach certain other representations or covenants set forth in the tax sharing agreement. We are also subject to restrictions on our ability to issue shares of our stock without satisfying certain conditions within the tax sharing agreement. As a result of the foregoing, we may be unable to engage in strategic or capital raising transactions that our stockholders might consider favorable, or to structure potential transactions in the manner most favorable to us, without adverse tax consequences, if at all.  The Spinoff could be determined not to qualify as a tax-free transaction, and Marathon Oil and its stockholders could be subject to material amounts of taxes and, in certain circumstances, we could be required to indemnify Marathon Oil for material taxes pursuant to indemnification obligations under the tax sharing agreement.  Marathon Oil received a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”), to the effect that, among other things, the distribution of shares of MPC common stock in the Spinoff qualifies as tax-free to Marathon Oil, us and Marathon Oil stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 355 and 368(a) and related provisions of the Code. If the factual assumptions or representations made in the private letter ruling request are inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect, then Marathon Oil would not be able to continue to rely on the ruling. We are not aware of any facts or circumstances that would cause the assumptions or representations that were relied on in the private letter ruling to be inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect. If, notwithstanding receipt of the private letter ruling, the Spinoff were determined not to qualify under Section 355 of the Code, Marathon Oil would be subject to tax as if it had sold its shares of common stock of our company in a taxable sale for their fair market value and would recognize a taxable gain in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of such shares over its tax basis in such shares.  With respect to taxes and other liabilities that could be imposed on Marathon Oil in connection with the Spinoff (and certain related transactions) as a result of a final determination that is inconsistent with the anticipated tax consequences as set forth in the private letter ruling, we would be liable to Marathon Oil under the tax sharing agreement for any such taxes or liabilities attributable to actions taken by or with respect to us, any of our affiliates, or any person that, after the Spinoff, is our affiliate. We may be similarly liable if we breach specified representations or covenants set forth in the tax sharing agreement. If we are required to indemnify Marathon Oil for taxes incurred as a result of the Spinoff (or certain related transactions) being taxable to Marathon Oil, it would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  We have potential liabilities pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement we entered into with Marathon Oil in connection with the Spinoff that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  In connection with the Spinoff, we entered into a separation and distribution agreement with Marathon Oil that provides for, among other things, the principal corporate transactions that were required to affect the Spinoff, certain conditions to the Spinoff and provisions governing the relationship between our company and Marathon    35    Table of Contents  Oil with respect to and resulting from the Spinoff. Among other things, the separation and distribution agreement provides for indemnification obligations designed to make us financially responsible for substantially all liabilities that may exist relating to our downstream business activities, whether incurred prior to or after the Spinoff, as well as certain obligations of Marathon Oil assumed by us. Our obligations to indemnify Marathon Oil under the circumstances set forth in the separation and distribution agreement could subject us to substantial liabilities. Marathon Oil also agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities. However, third parties could seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities retained by Marathon Oil and there can be no assurance that the indemnity from Marathon Oil will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities, that Marathon Oil will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations or that Marathon Oil’s insurers will cover us for liabilities associated with occurrences prior to the Spinoff. Moreover, even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from Marathon Oil or it insurers any amounts for which we are held liable, we may be temporarily required to bear these losses ourselves. If Marathon Oil is unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations, the underlying liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  Risks Relating to Ownership of Our Common Stock  Provisions in our corporate governance documents could operate to delay or prevent a change in control of our company, dilute the voting power or reduce the value of our capital stock or affect its liquidity.  The existence of some provisions within our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of us that a stockholder may consider favorable. These include provisions:        •    providing that our board of directors fixes the number of members of the board;        •    providing for the division of our board of directors into three classes with staggered terms;        •    providing that only our board of directors may fill board vacancies;        •    limiting who may call special meetings of stockholders;        •    prohibiting stockholder action by written consent, thereby requiring stockholder action to be taken at a meeting of the stockholders;        •    establishing advance notice requirements for nominations of candidates for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings;        •    establishing supermajority vote requirements for certain amendments to our restated certificate of incorporation and stockholder proposals for amendments to our amended and restated bylaws;        •    providing that our directors may only be removed for cause;        •    authorizing a large number of shares of common stock that are not yet issued, which would allow our board of directors to issue shares to persons friendly to current management, thereby protecting the continuity of our management, or which could be used to dilute the stock ownership of persons seeking to obtain control of us; and        •    authorizing the issuance of “blank check” preferred stock, which could be issued by our board of directors to increase the number of outstanding shares and thwart a takeover attempt.  We believe these provisions protect our stockholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors and by providing our board of directors time    36    Table of Contents  to assess any acquisition proposal, and are not intended to make us immune from takeovers. However, these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that our board of directors determines is not in the best interests of us and our stockholders.  Our restated certificate of incorporation also authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designation, powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional and other special rights, including preferences over our common stock respecting dividends and distributions, as our board of directors generally may determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of our common stock. For example, we could grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our board of directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of our common stock.  Finally, to facilitate compliance with the Maritime Laws, our restated certificate of incorporation limits the aggregate percentage ownership by non-U.S. citizens of our common stock or any other class of our capital stock to 23 percent of the outstanding shares. We may prohibit transfers that would cause ownership of our common stock or any other class of our capital stock by non-U.S. citizens to exceed 23 percent. Our restated certificate of incorporation also authorizes us to effect any and all measures necessary or desirable to monitor and limit foreign ownership of our common stock or any other class of our capital stock. These limitations could have an adverse impact on the liquidity of the market for our common stock if holders are unable to transfer shares to non-U.S. citizens due to the limitations on ownership by non-U.S. citizens. Any such limitation on the liquidity of the market for our common stock could adversely impact the market price of our common stock.    37    Table of Contents Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments
